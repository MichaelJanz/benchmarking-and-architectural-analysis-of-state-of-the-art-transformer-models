 spoiler alert  4.55 stars I listened to the audiobook while reading along with the physical book. The audiobook was very well done. The readers for characters Laia and Elias had accents that made it a bit more difficult to understand, and took me a longer amount of time to comprehend and actually read the book, so I found it best to listen to it at 1.75X speed slower than usual for me. not a bad thing just made it slower to read than I could have like how a person reads shakespeare and the old english text...takes more time for the words that Im reading to sink in, but I got it! Laia. A Scholar, whose entire family has been killed except her brother, Darin, who was taken to be interrogated. She has nothing else to loose so she decides to find the Resistance, the only people who might have a chance at finding Darin. She begins the story as cowardly and flighty, but has great character development that actually seemed feasible, leading her to act brave and courageous at the end of the book. Elias. A Mask at Blackcliff Academy, whose been severely and ruthlessly training since he was brought there as a young child. We find out that his mother is the Commandant, who is cold and merciless, everything he thinks he doesnt want to be. We open to his perspective as he is preparing to desert after graduation, so we already know he has previously started rejecting the ways of Blackcliff. I found this book to be similar to the Legend series by Marie Lu which I love! except with reversed character roles. June Iparis is like Elias, both conditioned to be callous robots to be used at will and oppress the scholarscivilians, who both break free from the mold they were raised in, to rebel against the system because they think the methods are unethical. Laia is like Day Wing, the slumish dwellers who are oppressed by a power who think lowly of them, who hate the system and think it should be changed, have both lost people they love, and find an ally in their quest to protect IzziTess. Just found this crazy how much they were similar but altered, and I loved it! makes me want to reread the Legend series again! I noticed that most of the interactions between Laia and Elias, while they were happening were only told from Laias POV. Not a bad thing but I would have liked to read some of their interactions from his side. I LOVE how this book is not the usual triangledlovestory, but instead has multiple parts and people that lead to the creation of a more complicated and therefore interesting and dramatic relationships between characters. The character development from Laia, Elias, Helene, and Izzi are all done very well. Helene dabbled back and forth a bit and was left in her version of a more empathetic version of herself for Elias sake. Izzi, who has been beaten down to a fraction of a person, is brought out of her fracturedself through the company of her first ever friend, Laia. This gives her the initiative or step towards changing the way things have been for her at Blackcliff and help Laia and her get information and then find the opportunity to escape. Elias wants to escape but changes his mind when he thinks he has found a better solution becoming an Aspirant and then the Blood Shrike where he could be released without attachment when Helene becomes Emperor. He comes to regret his decision to stay, but in the end, with Laias words of wisdom that help him get over all of his past grief All of the deaths that lay on his hands from the start imaged in trial 1 which becomes prevalent in the later trials 3 especially and prevent new regrets towards the end of the book. There are two kinds of guilt, Laia says softly. The kind thats a burden and the kind that gives you a purpose. Let your guilt be your fuel. Let it remind you of who you want to be. Draw a line in your mind. Never cross it again. You have a soul. Its damaged, but its there. Dont let them take it from you, Elias. pg. 373 Laia is set in circumstances which leave her to grow as a character to live without fear or hesitation. She goes in to Blackcliff with only one goal, to do whatever she has to do to get Darin out of prison wherever that is... haha :. This feeling of hopelessness and having nothing to loose is very dangerous. It throws all caution out the window and leads to reckless actions without worrying about repercussions. This allows Laia to loose her timid persona and adopt a one track mind kind of attitude developing her character so greatly and so quickly. This idea is similar to war. For example when Japanese fought the war so kamikaze like because why not. Also like in Hamilton YES REFERENCE! My Shot: I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory Whens it gonna get me? In my sleep, seven feet ahead of me? If I see it comin, do I run or do I let it be? Is it like a beat without a melody? See, I never thought Id live past twenty Where I come from some get half as many Ask anybody why we livin fast and we laugh, reach for a flask Right Hand Man: As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war I knew that I was poor I knew it was the only way to Rise up If they tell my story I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or Rise up We will fight for this land ... Its alright, you want to fight, youve got a hunger I was just like you when I was younger Head full of fantasies of dyin like a martyr? Dying is easy, young man Living is harder I felt that something fishy was going on with the resistance, we were not really given enough to be attached and to trust them. Laia let them send her to Blackcliff Academy to be a slave for the Commandant when literally anything could have gone wrong and she would be killed but she allowed it to happen and trusted that they would get her out when the mission succeed...It surprised me but this can connect back to the fact that she has already lost everything and this is her only shot to possibly save her brother. All of the shady business gave me a feeling...I wasnt sure what Mazen was doing and was still surprised when I found out he has been lying to Laia the whole time. Mazens plan to assassinate the Emperor falling into the commandants trap This betrayal adds more layers to the story which I feel will be further explored in the second book. I cried during this book, so that is a good sign. Good emotions and feeling. Trail 3 got to me. WOW. Lots of death I wasnt prepared for. Tristan and Demetrius left me sobbing!!!!! pg. 331340 I love it when books make me cry... I had a bit of trouble following how the Empire works. The Cooks stories were good but also just deepened the story and ended up leaving me with more questions than I started with. I get that Blackcliff students are trained to be Masks and wielded as assassins, basically. Where do the Scholars live? I have the hardcover edition that has maps on the inside covers which helped a lot but not with everything The Empire is ruled by the Emperor but I am not sure how he fits into all of this because we never meet him. How did he become Emperor? Who is it that controls the Masks? Is it Blackcliff or the Emperor? I want to know how the line of power goes... Emperor  ?  ?  Masks  Martials?  ?  Tribesmen?how do they fit??  ?  Scholars? And then the resistance...who is this made up of? Is this just Scholars or is this Tribesmen too? It is a HUGE world that Sabaa Tahir created in these books, which is insane! I find it astounding how much she was able to come up with there are so many parts to this... I applaud Tahir for creating such a gorgeously complicated and involved story! I am excited to read the next book, A Torch Against the Night to understand more of this remarkable story.
By Stephanie Perkins Summary: Anna was looking forward to her senior year in Atlanta, where she has a great job, a loyal best friend, and a crush on the verge of becoming more. So shes less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris  until she meets Etienne St. Clair. Smart, charming, beautiful, Etienne has it all . . . including a serious girlfriend. But in the City of Light, wishes have a way of coming true. Will a year of romantic nearmisses end with their longawaited French kiss? Stephanie Perkins keeps the romantic tension crackling and the attraction high in a debut guaranteed to make toes tingle and hearts melt. My Thoughts: As most of you know who follow my blog I have been wanting this book so bad!!!! So when it came as a surprise, I started jumping up and down yelling Yes, Yes, Yes! I read it the night I got it until late, than got up the next morning to finish it. I had a migrane so bad from not getting much sleep the next morning but it was worth every single second! My boyfriend wanted to turn off the bedroom light and I kept begging for 10 more minutes, 10 more minutes please! I didnt want to stop! Stephanie Perkins, how did you manage to make me fall in love with this book the way you did? I mean, I cant eat, I cant sleep, I cant think anything except how wonderful Anna is and how now I must go to Paris! Ive always wanted to go to Paris but now I must go there! HEHE! Im going to start off this review and just break down all the elements of the story I liked. I dont want to give away major spoilers but I must talk about this book! I could talk and talk and talk and talk forever! Nothing I could say will describe how much I loved this book. First off, we start off getting to know a little bit about Anna Oliphant. Her father is a published author, her brother Sean is allergic to red dye 40 I thought I was the only one her mom seems nice enough, and she is starting her senior year in a foreign country nope not at Clairemont High as planned. She has friends at Clairemont named Bridgette her best friend, Matt her exboyfriend aka friend and of course Toph her soon to be boyfriend aka coworker. She is going to miss prom, miss senior year classes, miss senior year activities, ARRGG! Her father sends her away to a new school, a new city, a new life. Her first night in Paris and she meets new friends. Meredith, who is her neighbor and the cute guy she bumps into in the hallway just outside Merediths room. Who is he? Etienne St Clair!! He has dark brown messy hair, hes short, brown eyes, beautiful, and English. Of course as soon as they lay eyes on one another, the chemistry is there. The next day she gets introduced to the other people of the group, Rashmi and Josh. There were so many characters throughout the book and I loved them all. Well, except for Ellie St Clairs girlfriend. Of course I wanted her out of the picture from day one! All the characters were great and each had their own personality and brought a lot to the book. Anna was constantly around them so it made for a lot of laughs, deep conversations, etc. Anna also loved movies. She loved reviewing them. I love movies so I can understand how seeing old classics on the screen for her was like a dream come true. Anna was such a sweet character. She was nice, she was easy to get along with, I just felt like she became my friend while reading the book. The scenery in the book was beautiful. Perkins did such a great job describing everything I actually felt like I was in Paris. I could see the people walking around, I could taste the coffee, I could just feel the foreign presence of everything. The emotional aspect of the book made me want to cry for St Clair. His mom gets sick, and its so hard on him. Hes such a tough guy most of the time that I just wanted to hold his hand and let him cry in my lap. Sorry Anna, but if he comes knocking at my door I will answer! LOL. Some of the scenes, okay most of the scenes were so freaking amazing. When he scoots his boot over to grab the nasty note about Anna before the teacher does, when they go see movies together, when he turns around and packs her clothes while she changes, and he glances up and their eyes meet in the mirror oops. Every scene was amazing! I even loved how he was afraid of heights and he was short! Most of the time I forgot he was short, he had so much confidence about him that he just came off as such a great wonderful guy. St Clair and Anna make the perfect pair; best friendsmovie watcherssleep mateslovers. And girl scout cookies, oh my! Thin mints are my favorite and I loved how Perkins included this scene! She put everything I want in a book in her book! She is an amazing debut author!!! Next, I want to talk about Anna and St Clair. The romantic tension was so hot I felt like I was going to pass out. There were moments I laughed, but mostly there were moments I was in love. I usually stay away from the sex aspects in book reviews because I feel like once a character jumps into bed with another character, I start to get bored. I want to see sexual chemistry where the characters dont fall into bed with each other right away. I want to see them fall in love with each other. I want to see their love grow before anything happens. Does that make sense? Well, Perkins does this in exactly the way I want and it blew me totally away. St Claire is amazing. The way he comes to her rescue with Dave, the way he runs to Ellie after the night of the kiss, the way he paces across his room floor. How can you not fall in love with this guy? Even while Anna went home for a few weeks, and St Clair was in California and their only communication was emailsphone conversations I still fell more in love with him. The chemistry and tension between Anna and St Clair is not only hot but sexy,interesting, charming, and just freaking awesome! The way they steal glances at one another, the way they talk, the way she notices his bottom teeth and how they are a bit crooked HOT, the way he calls her beautiful, the way they dance together on the dance floor, his accent,the way when he finally kisses her I had a big grin on my face! I cant say much more about Anna And The French Kiss that wont be said a million times by fans. Anna is amazing. Anna is a book you do not want to miss. If you read one book this whole entire year, please let it be Anna!!!! Sneak PeakDO NOT READ THIS if you dont want a sneak peak into the bed scene. Why are you still reading? LOL Snippets of the bed scene: He stops before me, scanning my face. Would it be okay if I stayed with you? I dont want to make you uncomfortable No! I mean... My head swims. I can hardly think straight. Yes, Yes, of course, its okay. Overall: Was Anna as amazing as I had hoped for? Oui! This review is long! I could write 10 more paragraphs about it though! HAHA! I read a lot of books as most of you know and Im introduced to a lot of good books but Anna And The French Kiss had that sort of element that Jennifer Echols Forget You had. If youve read my review for that, you know how much I loved that book. Its been a while since Ive fallen so completely in love with a book and Perkins brought me back to that feeling. That feeling where I wish the book was real life and I was the main character! Anna was a dream come true! Perkins took everything I wished someone would write and made it a reality for me. Merci beaucoup. Cover: Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! I love every little detail about the cover! What Id Give It: 55 cupcakes
Final Debt Indebted 6 by Pepper Winters 5 stars!! I closed my eyes. I said goodbye...I waited to die. So...this is a bittersweet review to write, since August 2014, Pepper Winters has had me hanging on every word, eagerly awaiting this book and yet dreading it at the same time. When a series is this long and this intense you cannot help but get emotionally attached to the characters and emotionally attached I most certainly was. Even though not all these characters have a heart even the blackest and meanest can sometimes show that there is red blood in there somewhere. This is exactly what Pepper Winters has delivered with painstaking precision over this six book series. Anyone can be redeemed...if they want to. She was mine as much as I was hers. Now and for always. Alive or dead. We were one. This was a book of revelations, a history lesson in the genealogy of the Hawks and the Weavers, a battle of survival, redemption and the will they wont they of the mother of all happy ever afters. Could the Hawks and Weavers ever coexist without The Debt. Could the Debt Inheritance finally be broken or will Cut and Bonnie continue with their reign of terror over their families, the Weavers and the blood diamond industry? So many questions but Im not answering any of them, you will just have to read for yourself. The eyes paint an awful picture, Nila, but the mind is far worse. For Jethro and Nila I wanted retribution, I wanted the evil to be extinguished with as much blood and guts as possible. I wanted them to be on the receiving end of what they had so fondly and happily delivered to all the Weaver women in the past, I wanted them torn from limb to limb. You may say that that is a powerful statement, but it is true. Pepper Winters has a powerful way with words and such is that power that I loathe some of these characters with such fervent passion I want to exact a few debts myself. The trouble with evil is that they seem to be able to dodge anything and everything, with the money behind them they have bought power, they are untouchable, but even the most fearless of warriors have an expiration date...or do they? I was on the edge of my seat waiting for their comeuppance, I was frantically waiting for Pepper to deliver...but did I get what I wished for? Im fine. Youre not. Ill live. You better. Nila is one of the most strongest female characters I have read about. She was fearless, she was a warrior in her own right, yet she still kept her empathetic side. She could still find the good in the evillest of souls and she wore her heart on her sleeve despite the most awful of circumstances she constantly found herself in. Dont let her win. Jethro Hawk was one person that never belonged at Hawksridge, despite being an empath he had always struggled to live up to what his father expected and once you get the history behind the relationship that he had with his father your eyes will be well and truly opened. Just the fact that he was still alive to tell the tale is a miracle in itself. The fact that he fought so hard to change who he was and couldnt was heart breaking and the fact of what he had gone through to rid him of his empathetic nature was soul crushing, but he was strong, he was a survivor, he finally had something to fight for and that something was a someone...Nila. How many times had I asked her to trust me, only to shatter the trust me, only to shatter the trust she bestowed? This would be a fight to the death and only the strongest survive. Jethro and Nila versus the Hawks was a battle even the bravest wouldnt have taken on, but when faced with life or death situations at every turn you will be surprised at just how resilient even the strongest of souls can be when the chips are down. This would kill me. But it had to be done. I stepped into the darkness and prepared to murder. Pepper Winters really went to town in this book, she poured everything into it. This has to be one of the best conclusions to a series I have ever read...expect the unexpected. Told in multiple POVs with a few from unexpected characters this book certainly packs a punch with revelations galore, and with some unexpected twists this book will capture every part of your imagination. Vivid descriptions of good and evil will have your heart palpitating for many different reasons, tears of sadness and happiness will flow but most of all you will sit back and reflect on this amazing journey that Pepper Winters has taken you on, a rollercoaster of epic proportions and one that I am incredibly sad to disembark. I gambled both our lives to save so many more. The strength of Pepper Winters writing never ceases to amaze me and I will forever be eternally grateful to her for the sheer amount of hours she must have endured in research just to deliver this epic story. The plotting the scheming, the little intricacies that most would take for granted yet once you get the full picture you truly appreciate. Those hours and hours of dedication to this series really shone throughout this series and were totally delivered into the loudest and vivid of crescendos. This was a Pepper Winters masterpiece and she was going out with a bang. This is not a goodbye; this is a see you soon. This is one of my favourite series of all time and while I am sad that it is over I am appeased by the fact that some of the side characters may eventually get a story themselves. This is not written in blood by any stretch of the imagination but a girl can live in hope. So on that note, I am going to stand up and give Pepper Winters a standing ovation, with lots of bravos in there too and many bows. For someone to build up a series so much you always worry that the end will be a letdown but this wasnt, it was a fitting end to one amazing story and a story that I will never, ever forget. Dedication versus empathy. www.theromancecover.com
Ive sat down to write this review three times now and my mind is, at once, lost for words and full of praise. How do I find the words to say just how much I loved this book? And how do I find the words to explain why I loved it so much? How do I talk about how much I love this author, who continues to wow me with every book she has published? How do I write about my excitement over her future projects, knowing that she continues to raise the bar with each story she tells? For Moonlight on my Mind, Jennifer McQuiston tries her hand at writing a murdermystery: Patrick Channing is accused of shooting his brother after a heated argument  to make matters worse, one of the guests claims to have witnessed it: Julianne Baxter. Never proven guilty, Patrick retreats to a small town in Scotland where he quietly practices veterinary medicine. Now his father has died and Patrick the new Earl of Haversham. Julianne Baxter has braved the wilds of Scotland to seek Patrick out, and bring him home. Eleven months ago, she declared with certainty that she had seen Patrick point the gun at his brother and shot him. Now, however, after eleven months had passed, Julianne is not all that certain about her version of the events. And she needs Patrick to help her sort through her muddled memories of that time. Seeing Julianne again rips open the wounds that Patrick is slowly trying to recover from and brings to the surface all the sad memories of his brothers death  now, he learns that his father has died and he is the new Earl. It is a moment that fills Patrick with sadness, dread and apprehension: his father, the one man who defended him and believed in him is dead, and he must return to his home to assume his responsibilities as new Earl, but this also means he must face the accusations and judgement of his peers, friends, family and neighbours. It would also mean dealing with Julianne Baxter, the most maddening, infuriating and most beautiful woman he has ever met. Not that he blamed them. It had been his rifle, after all. His bullet that had struck his brother in the chest. His guilt to live with, even as his father had battled to save the remnants of what was now  but should never have been  his birthright.  Chapter 4 Allies or enemies? Julianne serves as both protagonist and antagonist in this story  and I wasnt certain I would like her because shes so wilful and flighty, but Julianne redeems herself in this story. Shes a germaphobe and a pampered city girl, but she readily steps out of her comfort zone in order to look for Patrick. She thought she knew what she saw all those months ago, but time and circumstance has made her reconsider her previous testimony. She has come to find Patrick because she feels responsible for the dire situation Patricks family is in. His familys future is being threatened by calls to resume the inquest into Patricks involvement in his brothers death  if found guilty, the title and the estates would all revert to the Crown, which would leave Patricks mother and sisters ruined. Julianne knows she must do something, but she isnt sure of her part in Patricks life  as the lone witness to his brothers death, one word from Julianne could mean Patricks salvation or damnation. Shed hoped, she supposed, she would have arrived in Moraig to find Patrick Channing as unlikable and unredeemable as the London gossips claimed him to be. Then it would have been easier to forgive herself for her role in all of this. Instead, shed found a man who devoted his life to saving those whom fate had frowned upon. Shed ruined his life, and hed gone on to make a new one. A good one.  Chapter 6 A marriage of convenience. Patrick and his friends all agree that marrying Julianne would be his best legal move and defense because a wife could not be compelled to testify against her husband. Julianne believes it would be easier for them to travel together if they were married and it would also save her reputation after being caught by the village vicar. They claim a different reason for entering the marriage, but, deep down, they recognise the spark of attraction that began all those months ago at the house party that precipitated the tragic series of events. I loved the conflict their marriage presented. Julianne could not be compelled to testify  but it didnt mean that she could not testify willingly. I wondered if McQuiston was going to take her story down that road. I think I would have loved reading some courtroom drama.  The plot thickens when, early in the story, we discover that Julianne isnt an entirely credible witness because of her poor eyesight  I wondered about the legal and social ramifications her testimony would create if she reveals her problem. The marriage protects her from having to reveal this  but the truth still remained elusive to our hero and heroine: they know Patrick did not do it, so who did? And for what reason? McQuiston does an excellent job of unravelling the mystery: systematically and methodically. As Patrick and Julianne were comparing notes and memories of that morning, as more and more pieces of the puzzle were revealed and were falling into place, the love story between the two was also growing and deepening. And its a lovely, lovely story about a man who couldnt care about baths and personal hygiene despite being a doctor  but who was willing to endure being groomed because of love. And about a woman who was fastidious and neat  but was willing to get blood splattered on her dress and doesnt clean up first in order to chase after a lead that would save the man she loves. Like the ripples caused by a single drop of water, every moment that Patrick and Julianne spend with each other affects them from the outside in. Patrick changes from a man without much purpose to one with goals and direction. He stops being a man content to escape, to a man determined to confront the problems he faces. The love that happens between the two of them doesnt make sense: theyre supposed to be enemies. Theyre supposed to be polaropposites. Theyre supposed to hate each other. I really did not expect to enjoy them as a couple  this very oddunlikely couple  but, you know what? Jennifer McQuiston writes this particular aspect of the story so, so well. Her eyes met his in an ominous flash of green heat. Ive seen stables with cleaner floors than yours. For heavens sake, youre likely to give Gemmy fleas. You need a housekeeper. Ive a wife. He shrugged out of his shirt and tossed it away, perversely enjoying the way her eyes widened to follow the articles deliberate, ceremonious path to the floor. Ive been told they are nearly one in the same sic. At her strangled gasp, Gemmy hopped town from the bed and slunk for the shadows. Smart dog.  Chapter 7 Love proves to overcome all those differences  and Patrick and Julianne fall in love not blindly, but with eyes wide open: aware of each others imperfection; aware of the uncertainty the future holds. They might not have deserved each other to begin with, but they have proved their worth by the end. He dwelled a moment on her scent. Even her fragrance was a poor match for him. She smelled clean, like soap and spice, heated to the point of combustion. He smelled of his daily activities: sheep, sweat, and probably something worse. And yet ... as always, there was this odd, nettling attraction he felt in her presence, a surprising flare of interest that defied a scientific explanation. His thoughts were usually more ordered than this. More focused. Certainly more logical. For some reason, being around Julianne made him less like himself. Or was it that she made him feel more?  Chapter 7 Moonlight on my Mind is also a riveting story about second and third and fourth chances: Julianne, because of her brashness and impulsiveness, has made a lot of mistakes but she is never fazed or discouraged from trying again and again and again until she got it right. This is the third book in Jennifer McQuistons Second Sons series and its awesome.
Book Hangover has officially started. UGH.. just.. RAINBOW ROWELL I LOVE YOU. Your books are just so freaking special. I didnt think my unbelievable expectations after reading Eleanor  Park would be met with Fangirl but I am wrong. Liv and Cath and the fandom that reminded me so much of my days when Harry Potter was still ongoing... I love how realistic the book was and how not everything had a happy ending and everything got glossed over. Just freaking perfect.. a book with imperfect perfection. I am not making sense. one advice guys: PREORDER THIS BOOK IMMEDIATELY, I know I AM!  Review: Fangirl has solidified Rainbow Rowell as a must buy, must read, must recommend kind of author. Her YA debut, Eleanor  Park was one of my favorite books of 2012, and also top 10 favorite YA novels Ive ever read. I have to admit I was kind of scared that I would be disappointed by Fangirl. Ive been burnt more than once by my high expectations of a novel because I loved the authors previous one. But no, Rainbow Rowell didnt disappoint. I can go as far as saying Rainbow Rowells books are magical. Many contemporary books are interesting but in the end lack the magic I look for. What is this magic you ask? Well here are a couple of points that can help you in knowing whether the book youre reading has the magic or not. 1. Throughout the book, your heart is always beating above the normal heartbeats per minute. Fangirl had a ton of intense family moments that kept me on the edge of my seat, as well as moments between Cath, the main protagonist, and Liv, the love interest, that had me fangirling see what I did there? to the extreme. 2. When a book stays in your head and preoccupies your thoughts even when you put it down. It is the type of book that makes you stay up all night to read, or wake up earlier just to squeeze in a few chapters. 3. You tend to have a sudden urge to stop reading and hug your book or ereader because you have an overload of emotions you need to transfer, and the only outlet is through hugging that book or ereader that contains it. 4. You look at the page number and your heart drops when you notice you have less than 100 pages left. You try to read as slow as you can in order to stay in this magical world for as long as possible. All those apply to Fangirl. Every.Single.One. Plotwise, Rainbow Rowells novels arent extravagant and over the top with intense drama, and complicated plot twists. They are simple, clean, clear, and realistic. I witnessed that in Eleanor  Park and also in Fangirl. Weve got Cath and her twin sister starting college. The two girls have done everything together and are both part of the Simon Snow fandom think Harry Potter. However, Wren drops the bomb and tells Cath she doesnt want to room with her. Cath was so heartbroken that I couldnt but feel so sad for her. Also, Wren drifted away from the Simon Snow fandom and Cath is in it alone. Both girls used to write fan fiction but now only Cath does, and she has thousands upon thousands of readers. I really connected with the girls because I was also, and still am, a huge fangirl when it comes to Harry Potter. We also get to witness problems with Caths mother who abandoned the family when they were in third grade, as well as issues her dad faces when the girls leave for college and their dad stays alone in the house. I loved the relationship between Cath and her dad, it wasnt a perfect one or a broken one, it was in between where each one of them needed to lean on the other at times. Back at university, Wren chooses the partying type of life while Cath holes herself in her room, writing fan fiction. Cath might sound like a loner, but in fact she is just socially awkward. It took her two weeks to venture out to the university haul and even brought a couple of boxes of protein bars to allow her to survive in her room. Of course her roommate and her roommates friend, Liv squeal took every chance they got to tease her about this. There was a ton of the humor I read in Fangirl through the conversations between those three. As for Liv sigh that boy was worth any girls love. He was a friend when Cath needed one but didnt want to admit it, and a guy who told Cath everything she needed to hear, whether it was good or bad. I personally loved Liv to the extreme. Hard core fangirling here. He is twenty one years old so I didnt feel bad for crushing on him, thanks Rainbow Rowell! To sum this long review up, every single character, whether primary, secondary, or tertiary, had a reason to be in the book. As well as all the issues, drama, and fandom. Some plot lines were left open ended because that was how it is. In real life not everything gets wrapped up in a neat pretty bow. I think that is what I most appreciate about Rowells books, as well as the magic she sprinkles on every single character, chapter, sentence, and word in her books.
Its not a confession if no one reads it. Its just an unshared secret. THE STORY: Becca: I actually went into Confess completely blind, having read the synopsis quite some time ago I decided to avoid reading anything else so that I could go in with an open mind and no premonition of what was to come. Besides knowing that it would have something do with Art I was clueless. That is my favorite way to go into a book movies too! This approach really worked with how Colleen Hoover built this story. Bits and pieces about both main characters lives are introduced throughout the story until at the end we have a complete picture of not only their past, present and future, but also a clear picture of who both Owen and Auburn are. I really cannot reveal too much about the story without spoiling it, but I will see that as things were revealed Lisa and I were texting back and forth OMG! and then OMG AGAIN!! and by the way for those who have read this.. pun intended on the OMG! Oh and by the way... that prologue?! It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read, it sets the tone for the entire story and once I read that I was completely hooked! I was so enraptured by Confess that I did not want to put it down! Once again Colleen Hoover has worked her epic, magic, writing genius and my love her has grown grown even more! I love you so much. His voice is breathless and full of fear. Ill love you forever. Even when I cant. My tears fall harder at his words. And Ill love you forever. Even when I shouldnt. Lisa: CoHo, you can do no wrong in my eyes. You continue to blow me away with your creative writing style, insanely gorgeous words, and knack for pulling your readers in instantly and never letting go. Beccas definitely right about that prologue. It was so, so beautiful. Sweet, and sad, and definitely set the stage for story. Like Becca, I went into this story with no idea whatsoever about what I was going to encounter. I rarely read descriptions, so this is the norm for me. I just love going into a story with a blank slate. And with Colleen especially, this always pays off. The way she tells a story with so many questions, then revealing bits and pieces throughout, is one of my very favorite things about her. It definitely encourages the I cannot stop reading!!! behaviors we all struggle with from time to time. ; Shes like a light, unwittingly brightening up the darkest corners of a mans soul. THE CHARACTERS: Lisa: This beautiful story is told through the alternating points of view of both Auburn and Owen. Oh, how I love me some dual narration!! Auburn has relocated recently, living with a girl she just met in a small apartment near the salon where she works. She has her entire life planned out for her... minus the part where she needs more money. And fast. She stumbles upon an art studio looking for an assistant where she can make some major money, so she immediately agrees to the job. This is where she meets Owen, the studios owner. Owen was a bit of an enigma at first. Even though we have the pleasure of his voice for a lot of the book, at the beginning I wasnt quite sure on how I felt about him. He had a few secrets, and I unsure of whether I would want to smack him or hug him as the story progressed. This is one of the things I love most about Colleen Hoover and her ninja writing skills... so many secrets that really keep you guessing until they are finally revealed... and then... SO MANY FEELS! Good feels, bad feels, ugly feels... she brings them all out of me! Oh, Colleen... how you torture me so! Owen smiles, and I suddenly wish we were in the cleaning aisle, because someone is going to have to mop me up off this floor. Becca: So many feels is right and this book had them all! I would go from grinning, to crying and then to irrationally angry as I read! But these were all good things because each emotion was an integral part of the story! I liked Auburn a lot, she was so strong and her perseverance was one of the things I loved the most about her! As I learned more about her, my heart went out to her. She worked so hard for everything and never gave up on what she wanted, no matter how hard it was. Lisa is right about Owen, I wasnt too sure about him either. My head couldnt decided if it should trust him, but my heart was screaming at me to do so! His creative mind was absolutely beautiful! The way that he thought and spoke was as if his words were painted with colors and it was magical. The art workpaintings are such a major part of this book. Because we had an EARC we did not get to see the paintings and it made me so sad : Luckily, I received my preorder in the mail shortly after finishing and I immediately searched through to reread the passages and look at te art work... OMG the paintings are AMAZING!!!!! I seriously just stared at them and petted them while my brain soaked them in! By the way, the Artists name not its not Owen LOL is Danny OConnor :D I tilt my face toward her neck and inhale the scent of her. If her smell had a color, it would be pink. Sweet and innocent with a touch of roses. OVERALL: Becca: Once again, Colleen Hoover has amazed me! She is so talented and her writing speaks to my soul. I will continue to devour any and everything that she writes because her ability to incorporate real characters and beautiful stories packed with so many feels keeps me coming back for more! I had a serious book hangover after reading Confess, I was still so in love with Auburn and Owen and the amazing art that I had to give my brain and heart time to recuperate! If you have not read this yet, DO IT! Trust me, I dont think that you will be disappointed! Lisa: As Ive said before and will continue to say, I always rate books based on how they make me feel, and not necessarily on any technical aspects. Because of this, I have zero hesitation about rating this book a full 5 stars. I loved it. From page one I connected with this book, and it never faltered. Im continually blown away by Colleen Hoovers talent in writing such realistic and shockinglydefined stories. Her mind is a powerful tool, and I feel lucky to have the chance to experience it when reading her books. Once again, Colleen has made me feel things. ALL the things. And I couldnt be happier. If you enjoy Colleens books Are there really people out there that DONT enjoy her books?! this is one you will not want to miss!
Witty, refreshing, and electrifying. With a brilliant set of characters, laughs, and sexual tension that will have you pulling your hair out, Obsidian is the perfect page turner that will have you begging for more. After the death of her father, Katy and her mother believe its time for a fresh start. But, their fresh start ends up being in the middle of no where Ketterman, West Virgina. Katy expects for her life to continue the way it was, her mother working all the time and Katy gardening and book blogging. Then, she meets her neighbors... smoking hottie McDickhead, Daemon, and his over energetic sister, Dee. Daemon wants nothing to do with Katy, but she is determined not to let that get to her. Soon, she finds herself trapped in world she could have never imagined existed, and well, having a toohotforwords jerk at your side doesnt help when youre fighting for your life. Ever since I read HalfBlood and fell in love with it, Ive been obsessed with Jennifers books. I stalked her blog, her twitter, her goodreads real hard. And with all my high hopes for her sequel to HalfBlood and her other books, Obsidian in no way disappointed me. Instead, I found myself in love with yet another of her series. This book is about Aliens, as you can tell from the official synopsis, and not only is it unique and new from other paranormal reads, its a fascinating and beautiful type of alien. I really fell in love it and definitely wouldnt mind being a Luxen. Next, I love how she touches on book blogging. That she intertwined it into her lead characters life. Its almost like a tribute to the blogging community and it gave me another thing to relate to Katy with. Katy is a strong lead character and I loved her for it. With her father dying, and her mother busying herself with work, yet still there for her daughter, Katy is very independent, and its just one more thing I relate to. I dont have many close friends anymore like I used, and Im constantly going places, and accomplishing tasks on my own and in my opinion it just makes me a stronger person, as we can see Katy is just that, a strong person. Katy deals with a lot through Obsidian, and she handles it all with bravery and her own little spice. : Other than Katy, we have the hotandcoldpuresexwithamazinggreeneyes Daemon, and his ball of energy twin sister Dee. So many times in a book, you turn the pages and live for those steamy scenes between the lead couple, and I admit of course I ADORED those scenes I mean how could you not! UNF, but in Obsidian I also admired that Jennifer was able to pull me into the other scenes as well, particularly with Dee. I loved Dee and her overenergetic self. Shes the type of funloving girl who would light up a room just by being in it. She just wants a normal friend, and shes a good friend at that. So, um, yeah.... Daemon. Can I just say the banter between Katy and Daemon had me feeling so much emotion. Sometimes I was laughing, others my jaw was dropping or wanting to hit one of them, and there were the times when I just wanted them to jump on each other... if you know what I mean ;. Daemon has the looks... the tanned, perfect sculpted body. The unruly wavy locks, with electric emerald eyes which we all know is my favorite, but his personality is well hotandcold to say the least. Just when you think hes a complete jerk, he shows a softness. And just when you think the softness is there to stay, he flips the switch and hes back to the rude idiot that you cannot help but love any way. The relationship between Daemon and Katy just caused me so much angst. There were so many parts where I was just like Come on... come on... SERIOUSLY?! And I have to admit, I loved it. Theres so much sexual tension between these two that it seeps through the pages. I love feeling emotions like that, just makes the book 10x better for me. Oh, and the pen poking... poke me anytime Daemon ;. There was so much I could rave about this book. I loved the role that every character played. I adored the dance and party scenes. I ADORED the lake scenes. Kitten... yeah, I thought that was funny yet cute. The alien lore was so creative and I really truly loved reading about it. I love Daemons wittiness and arrogance and how Katy played right back along with him. I thought the writing was beautifully written. Finally, I love how Jennifer takes romance, laughs, real life situations, thrills, and paranormal and wraps it all up into one brilliant book. Its seductive, electrifying, and full of spice, Obsidian is a perfectly wrapped story that will have you flipping the pages faster than the speed of light. And its easy to see, especially with how it ended, that I am DYING for a sequel. : A HUGE special thank you to Jennifer and Entangled Publishing for letting me read this so far in advance. It means SO much to me and I honestly could not explain my excitement. I love your books Jennifer, and cannot wait to read more of them in the future! :
I know. We met less than a week ago and in that time Ive done nothing but lie and cheat and betray you. I know. But if you give me a chance...all I want is to protect you. To be near you. For as long as Im able. Wolf, are you asking me to be your alpha female? Alpha female, he murmured. I sort of like that. sigh Ill be your Alpha, Wolf. I so would. AH!!!!!! So fucking awesome!!! This was the perfect followup book to Cinder. I loved it more than Cinder. It was so intense and gory and fun and actionpacked. Amaaaaaaaazing!!! This is becoming one of my favorite series. I highly recommend it to everyone. Its a MUSTREAD. In Cinder, you follow the fairytale, Cinderella. We meet Prince Kai, Queen Levana, Cinder and many more characters. And though I loved that book, it wasnt as good as this one. In Scarlet, we follow the fairytale, Red Ridinghood. It was very similar in ways, but Meyer also adds her own story to the mixwith enough gore and intensity to keep you turning the pages until your eyes pop out of their sockets. I had so much fun with this book. Ill admit, I started listening to the audio and though I loved Rebecca Soler and how she narrated the story in Cinder and this one, I think I was finding myself a little too distracted. So I broke down and got the book and boy did I read it faster, not able to read fast enough for my liking. But at times she was slow, taking her time. Which is fine, but I liked going at my pace. So then, it picked up and I couldnt put this down. First of all, I gotta say...I love these covers. LOVE them. Like seriously. Theyre gorgeous and really fit the stories. So now, we have Wolf and Scarlet. Scarlets grandmother is missing, so Scarlet sets out to find her. But along the way, she finds out a lot about herself and where she came from. Wolf is a sexy, swoony, amazing, protective alpha. And damn did I love all the time we got with him. Sure, he was secretive about his part in the missing of Grandmere, but once he came clean, he was great. He did what he had to do to protect Scarlet. At times, I wanted to strangle her, and tell her to listen to Wolf. Okay, so how can you trust someone that lied to you? Well, hell Id listen to him regardless. It beats the alternative she had. He lied to protect her. He knew how dangerous his pack was and she didnt listen. But then again, she stopped at nothing to save her grandmother as most people probably would. But even when things turned out the way they did, I felt she should just trust him. And oh dear God. The gore in this is craaaazy. I dont mind blood and gore and violence. I love it. Its realistic and I watch it all the time in movies. Hell its even in real life. But I loved how Meyer was relentless with that part...she really made me feel like there were some real attacks going on. The wolves were fierce and mean and cruel. They didnt give a shit about morals or mercy. They just attacked and ate, like the feral dogs they are. Yikes! I still enjoyed it. I did even more because of all the bloodshed. Wow, that sounds sadistic. Oh well. I loved it. So when Scarlet finally trusts Wolf, I was all excited and giddy and rooting for these two. And when he asked her to be his alpha, I was screaming in joy. Those two were so cute. I could feel their tension burning up the pages. I could feel his wolf instincts kicking in and it was sweet. Love Wolf. Hes so...dreamy sigh Then we have Cinder and Kai. Yay! I was so happy Meyer included them still in this book. Cinder grew on me. I loved her chapters. I loved that she seemed to get a little stronger and more badass. But I felt bad for her because of what Kai is having to go through. Hes with the evil wenchQueen Levana. Shes relentless and wants to become the Empress to Kais Emperor. Yeah, Kai is the Emperor and she wants to marry him. But of course she has her own motives for that. And one that Cinder had warned Kai about in the first book. But he didnt listen. And now hes screwed. Stuck with this horrible witch. And shes brainwashing him to believe all that Cinder told him or pretended to be was a lie. But he realizes that theres no other way around this. If he doesnt marry Levana, there will be more bloodshed on his hands. He has to stop her from allowing the war to go onkilling innocent people when all she wants is Cinder. But Cinders missing, they cant find her. So what the hell is he to do? The next best thing, the other thing she wants. To marry her where shell become the ruler of the union and whatever. I would not wanna be in his position. However, I loved that Cinder and Scarlet are tied together. Both books were amazing. The writing, the characters, the worldbuilding, the action, the romance. I love it all. I just hope Cinder can get to Kai before he screws them all into the ground, before its too late. And I hope Wolf and Scarlet remain together in the next book and all is good with them. And they have a bunch of Wolf babies running around... Sorry, I got carried away there. So anyway, Im so glad I picked this one up. Im glad I stopped listening to the audio and got the book. I got a lot more out of it that way. I also loved Iko and Thorne as secondary characters. I couldnt help but compare Thorne to Kenji from Shatter Me. He was there for comic relief. His sarcasm and wit and charm was admirable and definitely needed for Cinder. But its what I loved about Kenji. I wonder if Im the only one that thought that? I still have that book on my mind, I guess. But I enjoyed the stories...interwoven with our beloved fairytales with great action and sweet romance. Such a fun journey. And I cant wait to get on with Cress. Im glad I gave this series a chance. I dont normally care to read about cyborgs and robots and stuff. But this one is just the right amount of awesomeness.
How does one review the final book in their favorite series? Well, Im not really sure.. But Im going to try to make this review make sense. It probably wont though and Ill probably just ramble a lot as I say goodbye to Henrietta and my little gang of friends there. . . Oh, and yes, there will be spoilers. Were just people, Maura replied. Just ordinary people. Theyre special. Adams tied to the ley line. Ronans a dreamer. Blue amplifies all of that. Richie Rich is just a person, Orla said. Yes, and hes going to die. I think Maura perfectly sums up how I feel about these characters. How special they are, both in this world and in my heart. I love how everyone, even the new characters that were always introduced as the story progressed, played a role in telling the main story. I was able to stay in love with our main characters and grow to enjoy all the side characters as well. I feel like Maggie Stiefvater must have lived and breathed these characters while writing her books because they were such individuals. If that makes sense? A better way for me to explain.. I knew who was speaking without needing to be told who it was. Every character had their own voice and that was what made falling in love with them so easy. Now, lets talk about my 4 favorite characters shall we? Love was a privilege. Adam was privileged; he did not want to give it up. He wanted to remember again and again how it felt. Adam Parrish, through my eyes he will always be the one who is far too good for this world. It took Adam a long time to realize that he was capable of love and that he was deserving of love, too. Who could blame him when he grew up with his dad though, am I right? I loved Adams development throughout the books and I thought his own character arc wrapped up nicely.. Having that ending between him and his parents was a great way to show how he has come full circle and grown from the boy we first met. Ill miss you Adam. I know. Because were great. But the difference between a nice house and a nice prison is really small. We chose Fox Way. We made it, Calla and Persephone and I. But its only your origin story, not your final destination. Blue Lily, Lily Blue. My girl. For me, even though she was extremely stubborn.. She always found a way to be the voice of reason within the boys. I appreciated what she brought out of them and what they brought out of her. I connected to her in a way I didnt connect with the boys because I understood how she felt about wanting something bigger for her life than what she thought was possible. Im so happy she got a great ending, she deserved it. Ill miss you my soul sister. He was startled to realize that he longed to be done with the quest for Glendower. He wanted the rest of his life. Until this night, he hadnt really thought that he believed that there was anything more to his life. Gansey. I feel like Gansey is either loved or hated? Personally, I love Richard Gansey III. He was the heart, he was the glue, he was everything that held this little gang together. I think the thing that attracted me the most to his character was the way he loved Adam and Ronan. How rare that kind of love was and how hed do anything for them.. It made him feel real under all that he pretended to be at times. I cried.. I cried at this ending. It was just so sad then it was so beautiful, and I just felt so many emotions in those last few chapters.. Im just real satisfied with Ganseys ending. I really will miss you Richard, like a lot. Was Ronan even human? Half a dreamer, half a dream, maker of ravens and hoofed girls and entire lands. Finally, Ronan Lynch. My FAVORITE character in this series. The only book boyfriend I need in my life. Oh, Ronan.. What a beautiful creature you are. There is no one who loves as deeply as you love, from your family to your friends. I honestly dont know how to express how much I love Ronan because I love everything about him, even his faults because it just made him that more relatable and real.. I could go on and on forever.. But Ill just say that I really will miss Ronan. Ill miss his dreams. Ill miss all those crazy things his imagination dreamed up. Ill just miss him, ok? I mean this is him and how he loved Adam: His feelings for Adam were an oil spill; hed let them overflow and now there wasnt a damn place in the ocean that wouldnt catch fire if he dropped a match.  Honestly, tell me how you could not love a guy who loves that deep?! Swoooooooon! Of course there were other characters, like Noah and all the women at Fox Way, but those 4 are the most important to me.. But honestly I loved every character in this series, even the Gray Man. I could go on and on forever about this book and this series.. And I never really know how to review these books because I cant say anything bad about them. It always just ends up being about how much I love these characters! : So, Ill end my review here. . . Then he closed his eyes and he began to dream. I like how the series ended.. Sure there are a million questions I have, but a part of me likes that I have questions and my imagination can still wonder through this world.. Ahh, Ill forever recommend this series to everyone! Goodbye Henrietta.
From:  The Good Read Hard and Put Away Wet... Okay, I have been sitting her for 10 minutes and I still dont know what to write. I guess it is fitting since Divergent left me speechless. How do I write a review about a book like this? A book that revitalized me, a book that made me bite my nails for the first time in 3 years, a book that ripped out my heart and made me want more. My face actually hurts from the emotions I went through. Ive been caught smiling like an idiot, crying like a wuss, laughing to near hysteria, and waving my hands around from nervousness all while reading Divergent. I swear I found a new wrinkle between my eyes because I read this book so HARD. You ever do that? Reading a book hard is when you squeeze the cover from anxiety, rip the pages in your haste to see what happens next, and having to actually get up and stand while you finish a scene because of your nervous energy. Oh yeah, everyone in my household knows that if I am reading standing up then that book is the BOMB! Dont laugh because I used the word Bomb, I am totally bringing it back. Choose a Faction... Beatrice lives in a world where one of five virtues dictates the rest of a persons life. Once someone turns 16, they must decide which faction virtue they will live with the rest of their lives. You have a choice between Candor the honest, Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Amity the peaceful, and Erudite the intelligent, but once a faction is chosen, there is no turning back. That faction is your family, your only family. Beatrice loves her family, but she struggles with the choice of staying with them within a faction that no longer suits her or going with the faction that has fascinated and called to her most of her life. Finally gaining the courage, she leaves her family, joins a new faction, and renames herself Tris. But the hard part is not over yet. Tris must now survive the horrifying training process, cruel initiates, and political intrigue that might just bring destruction upon the faction system. Tris... I dont think this book would have been the same without Tris. It is her that takes us on a journey of selfdiscovery, the concept of virtues, and the trials one must go through to be accepted. Her struggles between being selfless, brave, and intelligent at the same time were captivating. Its hard for her to be just one, but she knows showing signs of too many virtues can get her killed. She was so meek and small in the beginning that her surviving the training seemed impossible. However, she was like a blooming flower in the sun, the more she was exposed to the life of her new faction, the more she became stronger, resilient, and flourished in her new surroundings. I think any of us could look up to Tris not literally, that girl is short as all getout. She never gave up no matter how much she was hurting or felt unwanted. I Am Number Four... Four is the kind of person youll love and hate through most of the novel. Hes a bit mysterious, somewhat caring, and a whole lot intimidating. He goes through these moods. One day hes as sweet as pie, then the next he is nicking your ear with a knife true story. But underneath his mood swings, he has a heart that beats for Tris. His goal is to help her survive the new cutthroat world she has been thrust into, even if that means being her enemy from time to time. I liked finding out about Four in short bursts of emotion. His background and his true motives stay a mystery for a good chunk of the novel. Of course, this made him all the more interesting. Its the End of the World as We Know It... The concept behind Divergent is undeniably frightening and intriguing at the same time. In this dystopian world, war has been eradicated by simply cultivating the best virtues that any human being can poses. But in Divergent they have separated these traits into factions that live apart. The problem is, acting in accordance to one virtue does not guarantee a peaceful society. Eliminating peoples innate kindness or mercy to be brave or doing away with a conscious selfworth to be solely selfless leaves people open to attack on many fronts. What makes us human is the ability to experience all that life has to offer; to be brave when its necessary or honest when its appropriate. To focus on only one part of yourself can warp your ideals into something dangerous. That is whats happening in the world of Divergent. Factions are being corrupted. And if the one faction meant to protect you is unraveling, what do you do? Maybe, just maybe, Tris and her uniqueness will be able to fix what has taken place and find a way to triumph over the darkness in the world. I guess we shall see as the trilogy goes on. A Punch in the Gut... I was shocked by the direction this book took. We do not get a happy endingat least not yet. The initiation Tris goes through was nerveracking on its own, and then Roth decides to punch us in the gut by bringing the world down around our ears. It was a nice surprise because it only made me want to read book 2, Insurgent, even more. The plot was well structured, the pacing perfect, and the suspense was phenomenal. I was terrified for Tris most of the time. I felt her emotions as she struggled to become what her faction required. The fear of her fellow cruel initiates was a constant throughout the book. The betrayals against Tris hit me just as hard as her. The astronomical changes in her left me out of breath and craving more. Every multidimensional characterthe bad guys, the good guys, and the inbetweenerscontributed to this amazing story. Roths ability to write such outstanding fiction at her young age gives me hope as a young writer myself. The Bad The only thing that bugged me was when Tris forgave people that I think were unforgivable. There was some major backstabbing in the book, and no matter what happened to those people, I wouldve never forgiven them. But maybe Im just pigheaded. The Snuggly The romance is pretty minor. It takes quite some time for Tris and Four to get together. I like the fact that Tris is not very attractive but Four likes her because of her strength and determination. It gave their relationship a solid foundation because they grew to respect each other first. Id say the book is pretty clean except for some unwanted sexual touching. Overall I actually have Insurgent on the way to my house right now. I couldnt wait to read book2, and since it took me so long to read Divergent, I didnt have to wait but a couple of days. Roth did an amazing job of taking captivating characters and a kickass and compassionate heroine, throwing them into a terrifying world, and adding just enough political corruption, action, and drama to produce one hell of a read. This is not the kind of book you can pass up. Any adult or young adult out there will fall in love with Divergent. Its a must read! Excerpt I hear the crash of water against rocks. We are near the chasmwe must be above it, given the volume of the sound. I press my lips together to keep from screaming. If we are above the chasm, I know what they intend to do to me. Lift her up, cmon. I thrash, and their rough skin grates against mine, but I know its useless. I scream too, knowing that no one can hear me here. I will survive until tomorrow, I will. The hands push me around and up and slam my spine into something hard and cold. Judging by its width and curvature, it is a metal railing. It is the metal railing, the one that overlooks the chasm. My breaths wheeze and mist touches the back of my neck. The hands force my back to arch over the railing. My feet leave the ground, and my attackers are the only thing keeping me from falling into the water.
Actual Rating: 4.5 stars This book was enchantingly beautiful, hauntingly ambiguous, and magically mesmerizing. I adored it. Fair warning here: The book is a really slow paced. Its not a book you can rush through and expect to truly experience it all. Personally Im not used to such slow books and I often dont enjoy them, but this one was really captivating because even though it was slow, the plot, characters, and descriptions still catch your attention. The writing was immensely beautiful. At first, I didnt really know how I felt about the switching narratives from the third person omniscient to second person. By the middle of the book, I got used to it and liked it enough. One of the most important aspects was the setting, and I think Morgenstern spent a lot of time portraying it out so elaborately and beautifully which made the book feel so much more engaging. It was like you, yourself, were walking through the circus, feeling and seeing everything that was going on. It was sensational! There were a lot of characters; A lot more than I expected at least. I had a little trouble remembering them all at the beginning, but theyre all so distinguished and well written that eventually it became easier to differentiate them all. The love story... It felt like it was going to be the most important aspect in the book, but I didnt feel that way. I felt like the love story was like a secondary story that helped push the aspect of The Night Circus along. Does that make sense? I did enjoy Marco and Celia. Theyre not my OTP or anything though. I loved the concept of The Night Circus. I really wish that it was real and I could just go and visit it. The idea of it is dreamlike and hopeful and purely amazing. SPOILERS DOWN BELOW!!!! Oh my gosh can we please just talk about how crazy Hector Bowen is?!?!? He is like batshit insane! I was just cringing every time he slit open Celias fingers and made her magically repair them and then did it all over again! AGH. image error I really liked the background story about Prospero and Grey suit. It was interesting to read about how Grey suit was Prosperos teacher and he like splintered from him and started teaching as well but with more modern tactics. Its weird how even though Grey suit is older and was Prosperos teacher, he still has some feelings and morals while Prospero is like cold and apathetic even towards his own daughter. Marco and Celias relationship was really interesting. Its funny how they got together over half way through the book and their romance is sort of lustful and felt a little rushed. Maybe its because they were kind of already in love with each others magic and the tents they madethe feelings those tents elicited. Or maybe it was because they were bonded by those rings and Tsukiko was describing how when theyre bonded, their worlds are kind of dependent on each other. I dont know, but I did really enjoy their romance. It was sort of cheesy but I tend to love those kinds of romances. A lot of people dont like Marco because of what he did to Isobel which I agree was a total dick move, but I just didnt feel for Isobel. She was kind of irrelevant to me personally. I didnt really feel a connection with her and I didnt care about her feelings. In fact, I was kind of pissed off when she ruined the balance of the circus for revenge which led to the death of Herr Theussien :. But dont get me wrong I do feel for her. I get how she was really hurt and was kind of led on by Marco. Pretty much everything she has been doing was for him and to help him in the competition, but I guess I just felt more for Celia. Maybe it was because Celia was more drawn out and easier to relate to...? I dont know. I really, really, really adored Poppet and Bailey. Theyre probably my favorite pairing in this book. I just couldnt handle it. I liked Widget, Poppet, and Bailey as individual characters as well. All throughout the story, I was just so curious as to why we were following the perspective of Bailey. I kept asking myself, Whats his significance? At first I thought his POV would show how the circus was like after the competition because of the timeline. But then! The different POV timelines started catching up with each other. I was so confused. I liked Baileys story: his struggle with change and moving from the farm and not becoming his father and escaping to Harvard. I knew he was going to run away with the circus and I was so excited because I really wanted him and Poppet to get together. Their relationship was cutesy and adorable. And I just really like how Bailey represented everything the Night Circus is about. Its the Circus of dreams... It gives people hope, inspiration, dreams, chances, and an escape. Its not just a place for fun and games, it has a deeper meaning to it. It inspired and enchanted so many people who had this passion for the circus. It had that much influence. It carried that much hope and love. Bailey loved the Circus. He chose it. I loved how the guy on the train said that Bailey reminded him of Herr Theussien because if he hadnt died I wouldve thought that hed be the one to take over the circus. My favorite character was probably Poppet or Tsukiko. I really liked Poppet and her personality. Her readingspredictions were really interesting. I was just trying to keep track of them all. Lets see... She predicted Tara being buried. She predicted the red paint which was Herr Theussiens blood. She predicted the whole firepit event thingy. Tuskiko was a really intriguing character. When we found out that she was a former student of Grey suit, I was like... image error I loved her background story and her character in general. I liked all of the other characters. Did anyone else think Herr Theussien and Celia were secretly dating in the beginning? I loved their friendship to be honest. They loved each other and shared the same passion commitment for the circus. What I really loved was Widget and Grey suits conversation at the end. It was filled so many ideas and stories. I loved Grey suits part of the conversation. And that ending...It was brilliantly written. The entire third person narrative is essentially Widget telling the story of the circus to Grey suit. Am I right? Loved it. Favorite Quotes from the Book 1. The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones. 2. I prefer to remain unenlightened, to better appreciate the dark. 3. Most maidens are perfectly capable of rescuing themselves in my experience, at least the ones worth something, in any case. 4. There are no longer simple tales with quests and beasts and happy endings... The beasts take different forms and are difficult to recognize for what they are. 5. Good and evil are a great deal more complex than a princess and a dragon, or a wolf and a scarletclad little girl. And is not the dragon the hero of his own story? Is not the wolf simply acting as a wolf should act? 6. But dreams have ways of turning into nightmares. So I dont think this book is going in my favorites pile even though I loved it a lot. I think Im a little detached to it for some reason. Maybe its the narrative. But either way, this book was really great and Im really glad it was chosen for my schools book club book of the month. I initially thought I wasnt going to like it. Boy was I wrong. Happy reading :
Ismae Rienne never imagined an existence outside the dark, painfilled and hopeless one the man she called her father created. Forced to marry the local pig farmer, she at least hoped to find in him the kindness she had never experienced. But it was not to be. So when the convent of St. Mortain welcomed her, Ismae never thought of saying no. Even if she had to abide by their rules. And even if it meant she would be beholden to the god they revered. A god who some believed to be only a saint. A god who dictated the convents every decision. A god who sought vengeance against those who had done wrong. And a god who demanded of his daughters the retribution he sought to enforce. The very same god purported to be her father. And the god who was in fact Death. After years of training to be Deaths assassin, armed only with the skills she learned at the convent and her innate ability to detect poisons, Ismae set out with the directive to carry out her gods wishes. Desperately wanting to succeed, never anticipating failure, Ismae was quick to master her abilities and to act without question. But when not everything turned out to be as black and white as she once thought, meting out punishments without reservation meant risking herself, her humanity and even her heart.  Grave Mercy is an epic tale of deceit, betrayal, mystery, suspense, action, adventure and love. The authors rich and beautifully descriptive writing sets the stage for a story that is equally as textured, layered and compelling. The result is lush, magical and utterly riveting and the start to a new series that will be absolutely unforgettable. Strong female characters, exceptional abilities and deadly missions combine with a devious, underhanded, plotting and scheming nobility to create something rather unique. And with a historical setting that weaves in elements of fiction and fantasy, Grave Mercy will enchant readers and transport them to this other time and place. To a world where the gods of days of old still have power. To a world where girls are trained to serve, to fight, to carry out their deadliest of wishes. To a world where being in power by no means guarantees safety. Even for the most honorable of rulers. Or the youngest. As Ismae Rienne learns the truth about who she is and what her purpose is within the confines of the convent of St. Mortain, she begins to develop into someone strong and deadly. Someone more than capable of carrying out Deaths vengeful plans. But when her instructions leave her with questions and doubts about what shes done and what shes supposed to do, she must decide whether she can live with the consequences of either questioning her orders or following them blindly. One means turning her back on the only home and family she knows. The other means ignoring her heart and what she feels to be right. Both require a steep price to be paid. Neither are likely to end happily. Full of twists and turns, tension and nailbiting suspense, and a mystery that will keep readers guessing as to who is really involved in the deadly plots afoot in Brittany and whether Ismae will be the Duchess savior or her downfall, Grave Mercy will entice. It will engage. It will enthrall. And it wont let go. Author Robin LaFevers has done a remarkable job of bewitching readers with her new historical fantasy novel. This first book in the His Fair Assassin series more than introduces a character and world to its readers. It submerges them in the characters life and old world setting, creating an unbreakable connection for the entire read. At well over five hundred pages, the story flies, easily captivating readers with the authors ability to paint a picture with her words and by the the exciting tale this story tells. From the political maneuvering, to the assassination attempts, to a treachery so deep that no one is above suspicion, to one characters heartbreaking journey through this dangerfilled landscape, Grave Mercy is an absolutely unputdownable must read first book in the series. On a personal note: When I first saw the cover for Grave Mercy I thought it was simply a historical fiction novel. What I missed was the crossbow. My curiosity was most definitely piqued. And even though I was intrigued by the cover and the books description, I did not expect to be swept away by this story. But I was. Grave Mercy was so completely enchanting and captivating and seductive that I found myself lost in this story set in an era long gone by. I was completely transported into this world of Dukes and Duchesses, Barons and Viscounts. I was transfixed by the gamesmanship, betrayals, deceit and mystery. And I fell in love with the characters. Ismae Rienne was immediately lovable and sympathetic. The story, told in the first person from her point of view, made it so easy to connect with her. Even with the historical setting and the slight differences in the language of the time, she shined. She was kind and brave and smart and humble and grew to be someone who was absolutely deadly. But she had her own mind, she was willing to take risks to get to the truth, and she had a heart. And while she may have been afraid to succumb to her feelings at first, she wasnt closed off to doing so. And Gavriel Duval was her perfect match. Witty, charming, clever, strong and equally as brave, he complemented her so totally that I couldnt help but root for them from the getgo. They most definitely had chemistry and I spent much of the read wishing for their happy ending. But it wasnt just the two main characters that gave this story its allure. With a great mix of incredibly likable and utterly vile characters and those that fell somewhere in between, I was totally hooked. I wanted to see those evil characters get what they deserved and for good to win out in the end. Of course, figuring out who was good and who was evil wasnt always easy. I wasnt completely sure who to trust  Im still not sure about certain characters  which made the betrayal and intrigue and mystery that much more tantalizing and this story more spellbinding. Im just glad that certain events went down as they did. I just wish others didnt. Because the way some things happened did break my heart just a little bit. And while I did not expect to tear up in a story about Deaths Assassins, I did. And while I absolutely loved the characters, oh my gosh the writing. It was gorgeous. Absolutely beautifully, stunningly gorgeous. From the first sentence I was ensnared. The author painted such a vivid and beautiful and at times dark picture of her world. But I was right there. In the middle of it all. With Ismae. With Duval. And I was so caught up in the story and the writing that I had no clue it was over five hundred pages long. It was epic. But the story just flew by. And at its end I was shocked and surprised because I wanted more. And so now I have to wait. For a story Im told will be from a different characters perspective. To return to a world that felt very real, that the author brought to life so incredibly well, and that kept me so thoroughly engaged that I was sad to return to the here and now. So, yes, I love this epic story that makes me long to include the term mayhap in my everyday speech. And, yes, I may be just slightly in love with Duval and Beast. And, yes, I absolutely adore Ismae and Anne. And most definitely yes, I cant wait for the next book to come out so I can find out more about Sybella and return to this period in time which mixes reality with fantasy and luxury and privilege with deception and death.
 spoiler alert  Where to start? I dont think I can put into words how much I loved this book. I didnt want it to end. Im sorry I had to make this a review with spoilers, I cant help it, its the only way I can talk about it. This was the perfect ending to a wonderful series. Ive been very attached to this series, Ive enjoyed every single twist and turn along the way. Love. Intrigue. Politics. Action. Humor. This book picks up right where the last book left off. I wont get into the details of what happens in the book. But here are my thoughts on the main aspects of the story. Ill start by saying that even though I loved both Dimitri and Adrian, and sometimes I felt like I was on both teams I did want to see a RoseDimitri HEA. They were meant to be together. Now that being said... Rose is one of my favorite heroines! She kicks ass, shes loyal to her friends and shes a damn good guardian. She battles with her feelings for Dimitri, thinking he cant love her anymore, while still trying to be with Adrian. I only had one issue with her, and thats how she handled the cheating. I was dying for her and Dimitri to finally get together, but when he said that he loved her but that he wasnt going to take a woman away from a man that he liked and respected, she shouldve ended things with Adrian and then come back to Dimitri. It took away from their big moment and reunion for me. And then when she didnt come clean to Adrian right away because she still needed his help, that was just wrong. The moment she jumps in front of Lisa to save her, I knew that was coming obviously the book is called Last Sacrifice, so something like that had to happen, and Im really happy that nobody healed her, but that she recovered on her own and that actually broke the bond and she is now alone in her own body! Her and Lisa deserved that going forward. They can both have their own lives. Dimitri The Russian Guardian God! He is just so sexy! And now that he finally realizes that he can be with Rose, every moment they had together had me holding my breath and my heart beating fast. They were so romantic and emotional! These two totally deserved getting their happy ending. I loved the moment when he killed the strigoi and said to her Your hair is so beautiful. And of course my favorite quote from the book when Rose says to Dimitri But I was meant for you. I thought I was going to die! He finally lets lose a bit in this book, and is not as hard on following the rules. Lisa Yes we saw that coming. Of course she was destined to be the Queen, and Im glad shes grown into her own skin enough to actually pass all the tests on her own. She still has the support of Christian and still gets Rose as her guardian! Adrian This was the only issue I had with the book. Yes, Adrian has issues. He has a lot of growing up to do, and Rose was the person he was leaning on for support maybe too much. He was not Roses equal, I see that. But he loved Rose and the fact that she cheated on him, didnt come tell him, and then he finds out because shes kissing Dimitri before going into a dangerous situation after Adrian came to her aid. Not cool at all. I still hope to see more of Adrian in the spinoff series, I love him! And I really want to see him happy. I want him to get past his issues and grow as a person, but the hurt that was inflicted on him in this book was unnecessary. I was actually happy to see Adrians reaction to that whole situation because Rose had to see that her actions hurt him. After something like that there was no way things would be ok between them after. And when he confronted her she couldnt even articulate responses. She disrespected him in the worst way, and he had every right to treat her the way he did. Jill I couldnt have been more shocked to find out shes Lisas sister! My jaw dropped when she opened the door! Im curious to see if the spinoff series has anything to do with her, since Victor Dashkov made a reference as to her being importantspecial. And she took the whole thing of finding out who her real father was and being Lisas sister very well. I thought she would have more problems with that. Tasha I didnt see that coming until they interviewed the Alchemyst. Once we rule out Daniella, I knew it was Tasha, and all the reasons fell into place. I think that summarizes my main feelings for this book. It was amazing! Written perfectly, with so much intrigue, mystery, action, and yes romance. I wish it wasnt a young adult novel so we couldve read more about what happened with Dimitri and Rose behind close doors, Im sure that was amazing! ; I am looking forward to the spinoff series. I cant wait! I will keep reading anything that relates to this world.
ARC provided by author in exchange for honest review and blog tour Entice can be read as a standalone or after Emerge see review here  Embrace see review  or Entangled. I highly recommend reading in order, but this book is amazing even without the other three Just when I think S.E. Hall cant top the amazingness that is Dane Kendrick or Evan Allen, she goes and makes us fall head over heels in love with Sawyer Beckett. As soon as you open the book, prepare to surrender your panties to Sawyer. Hes the perfect package. Hes walking sex, his inner monologue is hilarious, he knows what girls like, and his best side is the inside. Cheesy, I know. But, he has the biggest heart behind all that tattooed, pierced, muscley hotness. He is loyal, caring, knows exactly what to say, and goes above and beyond for the people he cares about. Whats not to love about him? Because from the day I first saw you until the day I saw you again, I didnt like where I was. Now youre here and I do. So it stands to reason that staying with you, wherever it is were going, is my best course. I cant say much about the plot without spoiling anything, so heres a vague outline. In the prologue, we are reminded that Sawyer saw Emmett at Parkers bachelor party. She was a terrible stripper, and Sawyer is immediately drawn to her. Unfortunately, they were unable to talk that night and Sawyer has no way of tracing her. Fast forward to see Sawyer banging his pain. He goes through countless girls to try to erase the emptiness he feels inside. He cant stop thinking about the girl who got away. I have no idea why it takes some couples years to fall in love and some only a day, or if any of them even know. But I do know that I like you, so much. I want to know you, and I think you want the same thing. They finally meet again, at one of Sawyers notsofinest moments. Its pretty funny. And pretty soon, she gets a job at the K, the Club Dane owns and Sawyer manages. But, its not smooth sailing from there. It might have been love at first sight for Sawyer, however, Emmett has her secrets. The sexual tension builds as Emmett tries to resist Sawyer despite their obvious chemistry. I loved the buildup, but even more I loved watching them let go of their inner demons and slowly fall in love with each other. I told you. I warned you, Sawyer, dont give me your heart. I know you did, and Im not pressuring you, but some things you cant call the shots on. Im not sure if I gave you my heart or if you stole it, but either way, I dont want it back. I felt like the plot line for Entice was a lot heavier and even more emotional than its predessors in the Evolve series. I think it might just be that S.E. Halls writing is getting even better. I dont remember laughing this much with the other books. It might be because the book switches between Sawyer and Emmetts POVs, and Sawyer is downright hysterical. This book put my heart through the wringer for sure. It was full of ups and downs, and the best part was that they were reallife problems. It was just too easy to empathize and fall in love with Sawyer and Emmett. You scare the shit out of me beautiful Emmett, with how fast, how hard you completely mesmerized me. One day you might figure out Im an ass and run screaming, but Ill chance it. Ill risk anything to keep myself by your side as long as possible. I dont know if I can classify Sawyer and Emmetts relationship as instalove or a friends to lovers story. But I think its both, If you read Emerge and Embrace, you would know how S.E, makes her characters fall in love. She shows that theres some sort of inexplicable pull between the two characters, but she lets you come on the journey with them as they fall in love fast and hard. I love it. You dont need me to save you, Sawyer. Youre right. I dont. You already did. And Id love nothing more than the chance to show you what I can be. You already did. Oh, Em, you have no idea. Theres so much more I want to show you. Sawyer makes a complete 180 in this book. Its unbelievable how once Emmett comes into his life, he changes from a boy to a man. He did a lot of growing up in this book. Of course there are other factors which make that possible, but those are spoilers. I definitely swooned over the things he said and did for Emmett. And, god, is he sexy. I cant even. All I have to say is: DJ Booth. Read it to find out what Im talking about. Oh, and all his nicknames for Emmett? Swoon, swoon, swoon. Freaking killed me with all those terms of endearment. The thought of losing him is suffocating, a sadness so bone deep I cant take a full breath. I dont even remember who I was before I let him in anymore. I dont think I ever want to. The only Emmett I want to be is his Emmett. Emmett was more of an enigma. Sawyer wears his heart on his sleeve, but Emmett is a lot more guarded. It takes a while for her to open up to Sawyer, and even when she does, she keeps thinking that she could never deserve a guy like Sawyer and that hell be leaving soon. Once we learn her reason for thinking like that, it makes a lot more sense, however, all it does before that is cause more sexual tension no complaints here. I admired Emmetts strength and her determination. Its no wonder Sawyer fell in love with her so quickly. She is just as selfless and caring as Sawyer is. I knew the minute I saw you that youd be the end of me. I was right. Youre it. Youre all I see. Youre all I think about. I love you, Emmett. And of course, we get to catch up with the Crew. One of my favorite circles of friends. I get to see my fave, the adorable Evan, and his love, the equally adorable, Whitley. And we get to see more of caveman Dane, and the most stubborn woman alive, Laney. I loved seeing how much theyve grown up in the past year or so. Theyre just as closeknit and entertaining as ever. I will be sad when we eventually have to see them go. Thank you. Thank you for being exactly who you are and loving me exactly how you do. I dont know about all that, but I will always love you the best I know how. Evan will always be my favorite Evolve boy, but I know for a fact, that everyone is going to fall in love with Sawyer. We get to see him in a completely different light in this book. Who knows, maybe well get some people to convert to Team Sawyer which means less competition for me for Evan. Sawyer and Emmett are so perfect together, even when they forget it. They bring out the best in each other, and their love is the kind that changes lives. I was extremely pleased with how this book turned out, and I congratulate S.E. Hall on creating yet another story of finding yourself and falling in love. The only way I know how to give all I am to one person is the way I am with you. So babe, Im kind of a work in progress, but Im your work in progress. Only yours, ever, forever. I dont want to be away from you, Em. I dont want to miss another thing. See full review here 
The darkest minds in time never fade in the afterlight. Ive been giving good to excellent ratings so many times lately that Ive started to wonder if maybe Ive gone soft. If maybe I need to take a break from reading YA for a while. But then I start comparing the books I read this year to the ones I read in 2013 and 2014 and I guess a lot of them just werent as good. Its been a few days since I finished The Darkest Minds and Im halfway through the sequel as we speak finished the novella as well. I dont regret hitting that fifth star. Not one bit. This was good. Really good. In most ways this is a typical dystopia, but that doesnt mean it cant compete with the best. Yes. I said it. It has so much potential to become great. This book had been recommended to me endlessly. Everyone kept saying I should read it, but Id never really gotten around to it until this summer. And man do I regret putting it off that long. First of all, I had no idea what this book would be about. I didnt read the blurb on goodreads, god, I didnt even read the back of the book. Thats how clueless I was when I started it. Imagine my surprise at the setting I found myself in. Camps. Workrehabilitation camps. They gave me the shivers actually. Still do. Mainly because I couldnt help comparing them to the WWII camps, you know? I get that this is fantasy and that they were very different, but I suppose theres no denying where the idea came from. These were all children, though. Jeez. That fucked me up big time. The Darkest Minds tend to hide behind the most unlikely faces. Ruby. Ruby is one perfectly flawed heroine. Whats to say? I loved her. Not just because she was broken or because she stood up for herself and slowly turned into this brave and powerful young woman. All of that was true and all of that made me like her and want to throw my arms around her. But I especially admired her because of what she was willing to sacrifice for the ones she loved. Theres something dangerously compelling about sacrifice in these kind of circumstances. It took a long time for her to start trusting people again, to start accepting who she was, but shes never halfin. She doesnt make the easiest choices. She makes the ones that are necessary, however painful they might be for her. Ruby reminded me of June from the Legend series. They are very alike. I think maybe the most frustrating thing in the world is to have something to say but not know how to put it into words. Its not just about Ruby though. She has to share the top spot in my list of favorite The Darkest Mindscharacters with Liam. And Zu. And Chubs. All of the characters were just so different and wellbuilt and excruciatingly likable. My heart is full of them. I couldnt choose between them if you held a gun to my head and threatened to blow my brains out. Honestly. Zu was adorable, Chubs was loyal and the best friend you could ever ask for and Liam was so, so genuinely good it hurt. And then Im not even talking about other characters that were profoundly shaped and complex, even if they appeared only for a short time. I. Am. Complete. Trash. The romance in this book is really well handled. It never takes the focus on the main story away. Its subtly finds its way in and it is never ever too cheesy. They sort of become friends first and I always appreciate that. They are my favorite kind of romances. Ruby, give me one reason why we cant be together, and Ill give you a hundred why we can. We can go anywhere you want. You could read this book for the characters alone, but theres so much more. The plot is really creative. Maybe the entire idea of children with special abilities isnt new, but Alexandra Bracken owns it. She creates a world that sucks you in from the very first page. Its a brutal one that lacks any kind of sympathy. Theres nothing about the circumstances she builds that you would ever envy. And that makes you very emotionally invested. You could feel bad for just about every one. Every character in this book has been shaped into what heshe is today by an impossibly awful past. The children in this world are struck by a virus that either kills them or makes them outcasts. Society fears them, loathes them. If they want to survive they have to build themselves a hard and terrifying life on the run. It sucks, but it beats the alternative of being sent into the rehabilitation program. Which should sufficiently prepare you for feels and heartache. Because ohmygod THAT ENDING. The most important thing you ever did was learn how to survive. Do not let anyone make you feel like you shouldnt have. Clearly theres also a bigger picture. One that doesnt become too clear in this first book, but will definitely be developed over the course of the next installments. Im really curious to find out how things will work out. I have so many questions, so many suspicions, fears and hopes. I think its safe to say I will finish this series rather soon. No way Ill stop reading until I know exactly how it ends. I guess theres something to say for starting to read a series once all of the books have been published. Its probably also a good thing I only started reading when most of the hype had died down already. If you are, like I was, waiting for the good opportunity to start dont waste any more time hesitating. Just pick up the book and start READING. Just to finish I want to react on something I read in the reviews of this book. Some people seem to think this book is too long. Let me tell you, I dont want to read that ever again. If a book is good, it can never be too long. Honestly, Im sick of young adult publishers trying to release as many books as possible, even when the story could have fit perfectly in just one or two books. Besides, the books in this series are not that long. So enjoy them. Lets carpe the hell out of this diem.
Hes uncertain whats going to happen next. But he is certain that thats actually the point. If this is all a story, then thats what the story means. If it isnt a story, then the exact same is true.  five out of five stars. spoilerfree review Please, take a seat while I managed to get my thoughts in order... How can I even review this without blurting out spoilers? Oh, how it will be hard for me when all I want is to shout at you the plot twists that occurred, scream at you how confused I was and the theories I had and the moments that warmed my heart and broke it. But, how about we instead start with the synopsis to More than This? A boy drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments. He dies. Then he wakes, naked and bruised and thirsty, but alive. How can this be? And what is this strange deserted place? As he struggles to understand what is happening, the boy dares to hope. Might this not be the end? Might there be more to this life, or perhaps this afterlife? As you can see, the official blurb doesnt give away much. Which I think is a good thing, to go into this blind with no clue what the protagonists name even is. But, alright, I will tell you, if only because this review will be impossible to write without his name; Seth. This book blew me away. I didnt expect anything from it; I picked it up at random and hadnt heard any hype surrounding More Than This. More so, because this book is labelled as a dystopian novel and I hadnt read the best books under that genre, I was kinda put off reading this and biased, thinking before Id even read the first page for I wasnt going to like it. This dystopian, though, really came through for me. My favourite thing about More Than This is that Patrick Ness was fully aware of what he was doing when writing this book; Patrick Ness leaves you hanging at the end, unsure about multiple things. Patrick Ness doesnt answer any of your theories, just adds to them. Seth, the main character, even thinks at one point that the whole point of what hes experiencing, his journey from start to finish, is that there is no point. Then again, maybe the point was that there was no point. So if this is all a story in my head, he thinks, then maybe  Oh, forget it, he says with feeling. Nobody knows anything. Now, Ill be honest; I was so close to dnfingdnfdid not finish this book. There was little to no dialogue in the first 150 pages and I struggled reading for the first quarter partly because of that. And partly because it was getting slightly boring, with Seth just doing stuff in the world hed woken up in. But, boy, oh boy, am I glad I pushed through. The protagonist, Seth, is quite YAyoung adult. Meaning that hes a basic young adult main character. Trust me when I say I mean that in the best way possible. He really does seem plain and ordinary, and a lot like other protagonists Ive read about, especially in standalones. That saying, I still adored him. I loved the way he thought and how he worked his mind around what was happening to him. I loved Seths multiple theories about the world he was put in and how he analyzed it everything since the beginning. The two complaints I have is 1 Id wished itd been longer. I wasnt ready the leave the characters and plot when I finished. And, secondly, because of the first 150 pages of the book. Those pages couldve been cut down, I feel like. Still, More Than This fucked me up and left me shaking my head and thinking Seth, thats a real dumb explanation and youre definitely reaching for this to make sense Just when I was getting used to the idea of Seth in this world and the explanation as to what the world was, Patrick Ness flips everything upside down. And this happened multiple times. When you thought you knew the plotline, bam! The author would answer some of your questions only the pile on more. With the first plot twist, I actually gasped because Seth and Patrick Ness had sold me the idea of what was currently happening, that nothing was going to change. I was certain I knew the brief premise of the world. Obviously, I didnt actually have the faintest clue. My verdict is that you. Need. To. Read. It. I literally cant say anything important about More Than This because its all spoilers. The characters? SPOILERS. The plot or anything at all about what occurs? SPOILERS. The world? SPOILERS. The ending? You guessed it; SPOILERS. The fucking book reminds me so much of The Matrix. Both main characters, Neo and Seth were put in this world unalike compared to their own, only to find its actually the real world and the one they came from is fake. Sorry, but that all I could think about when I read that plot twist. I aint mad about it, though, because I really liked The Matrix when I was younger. Like I said, the thing best about this book is how out of control and weird it gets. From the blurb, you get absolutely nothing about this book. The blurb is done and over in the first 30 pages; Seth dies and wakes up in an unknown world. But what happens next? Is he in the afterlife? The book is full of possibilities. Ive read More Than This and I still dont fully know what the world is. Seth and Is theories are still unanswered, we just werent given an exact explanation and never will. To tie this up, Patrick Nesss novel is thoughtprovoking, gripping and fascinating. I want to stay in Seths head and never leave. I want to reexperience More Than This all over again. I want an actual answer of my three possible explanations and I dont at the same time. I want the world to stay in mystery and for the readers to be left in the dark. More Than This is a book where you dive headfirst into and are astonished at what you find.
4.5 stars Last night, I returned from Star Wars on an emotional high. Despite the facts that it was 10:30, I had over 300 pages left, and I had to be up for work in the morning, I decided that it was the perfect time to finish Winter. See, hype can make it tough for me to tap into my emotions, and I was already emotional, so really it WAS a great time for me to finish, even if I am really tired now. Worth it. The Lunar Chronicles has been amazing from start to finish, which I say with extra confidence having just reread the earlier books as well. Going back before I started Winter was very nice, not just because I didnt remember some important plot things from Cress and also wanted to see if my opinions on certain ships had changed ahem, but because I can see the planning that went into the series now in ways that I couldnt before. Reading Cinder, I had no idea what the scope of the series would be or how things would turn out, aside from the defeat of the evil queen and happiness of the ship because fairy tale. I never could have imagined the grand scope that Meyer put together. Going back through the series, it was obvious that Meyer had everything planned out, at least the big picture stuff, when she wrote Cinder. I think thats why this is one of the best series enders Ive read. Last night, I returned from Star Wars on an emotional high.

I think thats why this is one of the best series enders Ive read. Given the fact that I was pretty much positive going in that I knew how the series would end, due to fairy tale archetypes, Meyer did manage to surprise me. Winter was more violent and intense than I expected for one thing. And its all made extra painfully stabby by the fact that friends have to deal the blows on friends. On top of that, I was actually surprised that it didnt end with four weddings in grand Shakespeareanfairy tale style. In fact, the ships are left open and are clearly going to take some time before they marry, which makes me happy. I was tentatively on board CressThorne finally, and it really helps knowing theyre not going to make any rash decisions . Shipping has always been somewhat turbulent for me in this series, my ships waxing and waning with each book and even each read of each book. Having finished a full read of the series for the first time, I can tell you that I think Ive come down with this order on the ships: KaiCinder, CressThorne, WolfScarlet, and WinterJacin in last place. I dont know what it is about the steadiness of Kai and Cinder that I adore, but I guess I just really love the strong heroine constantly saving her boyfriend. Kai is the only one in the series who never does anything with physical strength his own or manipulated, which is really pretty fascinating. He ends up being more useful than I would have thought, and his behavior towards Cinder at the end is so fucking cute. In general, I love that, in each ship, the girl really calls the shots. Even Cress pretty much rules Thorne because he totally forgets how to buckle swashes around her. More than the ships, though, I really love the dynamic of the whole group. Meyer shuffles the group around a lot in the last two books, so they basically all get to know each other at least a little bit, and I love the interactions. Cress and Wolf have some good moments together where she learns to stop fearing the sweet puppy who just misses his girlfriend. There are some great CressKai moments in Winter too. Scarlet and Winter have an amazing friendship arc View Spoiler . Not to mention CinderIko, who have been strong from the first. I also love that it seems like Iko might get her own bit of hotness in the fullness of time. GET IT, GURL. There are just two things that could have made this series better in my opinion. Firstly, Everything would have been imbued with so much more tragedy if Meyer had succeeded in making Levana a tragic figure. I think thats what Fairest was meant to do, and, it almost worked, but and totally would have been a great ship if Meyer decided to kill some folk and embrace ff destroyed what sympathy I had for her horrible childhood. She was actually too much of a monster and a villain, making everything really black and white. That does fit fairy tale archetypes, but oh man the pain when you also care just a wee bit about the villains. Secondly, The Lunar Chronicles is depressingly heteronormative. I mean, I could blame fairy tales for that I guess, but, yeah, Im not going to. Now that publishing is letting LGBT books through much more regularly, Im so disappointed that theres not even the slightest hint of anyone not being one hundred percent straight in this whole massive series. Just no. As Gillian Writer of Wrongs said when I talked about this with her, Jacin so easily could have been Jacinda. The Snow White story would clearly be there with a lady guard just the same. sighs If youve not started The Lunar Chronicles, theres no reason to wait; its complete and its got a wonderful ending. Though I totally get waiting for the hype to die down. If youve not finished, GO FOR IT. The Lunar Chronicles is one of my favorite series, and I cannot wait for what Meyer does next though I hope it embraces all the colors of the rainbow.
Continuing on my trend of reading the super hyped and popular books late, I finally read Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo and the sequel too but shhh the review is coming later. And let me just say, wow! I now understand why these books are so loved by the whole book blogging community. The writing is superb, the characters are precious, and the plot is so fast paced and intriguing, with tons of twists and turns, and an overall theme of darkness. No mourners. No funerals. This book centers around a group of fugitives, thieves, assassins, and witches as they try to do the impossible: break into the impenetrable Ice Court and retrieve a hostage. Now that I look back on it, that really is the main plot in the book, but that doesnt mean the story is straightforward. Far from it. While the plot is actionpacked, this really is a character driven story, which Ill talk about later on. The relationships in this story between all the different crew members shift and change and are a main focus of the story as well. Now one of the main misconceptions I had before reading was that the crew was going to become this group of best friends, where they all trust each other with their secrets and protect each other 100. This is false. Most of the crew hates each other in the beginning, and there really is only one pairing of best friends. They all grudgingly respect each other, and throughout the story begin to protect each other with their own lives, even if it is only because they recognize that the other person is a necessary part of their operation, but they never become the secret whispering, best friend group that I had pictured. A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who has become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse. That being said, I absolutely loved all the characters, although I had my issues with some of them. They were not the noble, honest, obviously good characters, but dark, twisted, tormented, and murky characters. Theres Kaz Brekker, the leader of the operation. Hes cruel and calculating, but a mastermind and fearless. Next is Inej, the Wraith or the spider of the group. Shes tiny, silent, and deadly, but also faithful and optimistic and observant and also one of my favorite characters. We have Jesper, the sharpshooter of the crew. Hes goofy, lighthearted, and has a penchant for gambling, but ultimately is loyal to his crew and brings laughter when they are on the brink of death. Theres Wylan, the baby of the group. Hes used as the bargaining coin, but has other skills such as creating bombs. The fifth member of the group is Nina my other favorite character. Shes flirty, fearless, and magical. Literally, she has magic powers that let her control peoples breathing and pulse and emotions. But shes also loyal, honest, and loving, bringing humanity to her. The last member is Matthias, an exmilitary man and escaped fugitive. He is the brute force of the operation, as well as the actual trained killer. Together, these six characters make for a deadly group. As I said earlier, Nina and Inej are my favorite characters. They both have the most heart, in my opinion, and the ability to actually care for someone else. They are fearless and strong, but understand that emotions are not a weakness. Their friendship is also one of the most heartwarming parts of the book. They are friends not only for survival, but because their personalities mesh together and they understand each other. Sometimes, theyd be on the brink of death, or about to embark on a deadly mission, and their conversation would still bring a smile to my face because of the obvious love they have for each other and the comfort they feel around each other. There was no part of him that was no broken, that had not healed wrong, and there was no part of him that was not stronger for having been broken. I have some issues with Kaz, because of how cruel he is, and how he almost seems to have no conscience. As the book goes on, he becomes more human, but he still is so cold and calculating, never letting himself give in to the emotions he is feeling or show mercy. I understand, they are basically fighting for their lives throughout the book, so mercy would be poorly placed, but there are times when he shouldve forgiven easier and sooner, or given second chances. That being said, I can appreciate him for the mastermind he is, and can respect his mind and how he is able to put together almost impossible schemes and operations to achieve his goals. His dedication to a cause is extraordinary. My last note about the characters before I move on is how diverse their crew is. There are physically disabled characters, many different races and religions represented, a couple members of the LGBTQIA community, and some mental limitations represented. Im sure Im forgetting some of the diversity represented, but honestly it was so great to see these characters so different from each other in such a natural way, and so real. Next in this super long review is my raving about the world building. It was just superb. Each nation was given an identity, and the entire city of Ketterdam, with its rival gangs, felt as much a part of the story as the actual plots and characters did. Plus, all the rivalries felt real and deep, not just thrown in there for drama. But my main example of the amazing world building done is the Grisha. Bardugo basically created a race of humans with magical abilities, so obviously there was a lot of information that needed to be disclosed about them, including about the people that hunt them down and kill them. Also, apparently her other series is a whole Grisha series?! Whaaaaaat?!. But all the information felt seamlessly woven into the story, so there was never a large info dump paragraph that disrupted the flow of the story. The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true. And then theres the romance. As we all know, Im a huge fan of romance, and the romance between Nina and Matthias was perfectly written. It never overtook the story, but was developed all the same. It shows how complex love can be, and how love requires compromise. They are now one of my favorite ships in a YA book, just because of how real it felt to me also they are one of my favorite tropes. And thats it with this super rave review! When I was going into the story, I did not expect to love it as wholeheartedly as I did, but I could not put this book down. Everything about it is so masterfully done that it deserves five stars.
The Greek philosopher Heraclitus 535 BC475 BC famously said that you cannot step into the same river twice. Well, he didnt know Ursula Beresford Todd, the main character in Kate Atkinsons bonny, daring, and sublime novel Life After Life. Time is not circular in Atkinsons tale; rather, Ursulas life is like an ouroboros, the ancient symbol of a serpent eating its own tail. Atkinson continually recreates the character of Ursula; she is like a phoenix that is reborn over and over again. Become such as you are, having learned what that is, Atkinson writes in Life After Life. On a bitterly cold day in February of 1910, a baby is born in Britain. The umbilical cord is wrapped around her little neck, and she does not survive. And then, on a bitterly cold day in February of 1910, a baby is born in Britain. The umbilical cord is wrapped around her little neck, but the doctor uses scissors snip, snip, and the child lives. Her name is Ursula little bear, and she just may hold the fate of mankind in her tiny hands. The years pass, and Ursula grows older. Here, Atkinson ably illustrates the fragility of life in the early Twentieth Century when reaching adulthood was not guaranteed. One by one, Ursula is felled by drowning, a fall, and the Spanish flu of 1918. With words such as darkness fell, Atkinson takes Ursulas young life. It feels miraculous when Ursula finally enters her 20s and 30s, only to encounter a whole new set of difficulties. Ursula perishes over and overmurdered by a violent, abusive husband; killed in the London Blitz; dead by suicide as the Russian army enters Berlin. The authors plot device, killing a character and then bringing her back to life, initially felt cheap and gimmicky. Atkinson quickly won me over, though, and in record time. Reading Life After Life, I experienced such a widerange of emotions that I wrung my hands and gnashed my teeth. Each time Ursula died, I grieved for her. Then, I turned the page to find Ursula very much alive. It is as if Atkinson has her very own reset button and simply sets things right again. Atkinson sometimes returns to Ursulas birth, but not always. Other times, Atkinson resets the tale to some pivotal moment in Ursulas past, a specific point in her life, a day that seems no different from any other, yet a day when some kind of momentous choice was made that charted the course of Ursulas life. I began to wonder: just what does Atkinson have in mind for Ursula? Because clearly, why continually resurrect a character if she does not have some kind of higher purpose? Practice makes perfect is an idiom Ursulas mother repeats throughout the novel. Ursula champions the phrase: We can never get it right, but we must try. The more Ursula lives her lives, the more she learns from them. Atkinson uses Ursula as a palimpsest. Her life is like a piece of parchment whose text is wiped away, but traces still remain. Ursula experiences deja vu as she remembers her past lives. Its like reincarnation, except that Ursula comes back after death as the same person. As Atkinson kills and revives Ursula, notions of predestination versus free will come into play. In Life After Life, choices matter. Atkinsons aim is to have Ursula retain some of the knowledge she acquired from her past lives, information that will not only change Ursulas fate but possibly the futures of those around her and even the fate of the world. Dont you wonder sometimes, Ursula muses as World War II destroys everything around her, if just one small thing had been changed, in the past, I mean. If Hitler had died at birth, or if someone had kidnapped him as a baby and brought him up in...a Quaker household. Her friend Ralph counters, Hitler might have turned out just the same, Quakers or no Quakers. You might have to kill him instead of kidnapping him. Could you do that? Could you kill a baby? With a gun? Or what if you had no gun, how about with your bare hands? In cold blood. If I thought it would save Teddy, Ursula thought. Not just Teddy, of course, the rest of the world, too. Teddy, Ursulas beloved baby brother, was an RAF pilot who got shot down by the Germans. Teddy once asked Ursula, What if you had the chance to do it again and again, until you finally got it right? Would you do it? And so Ursulas purpose becomes crystal clear, as does the reason behind Atkinsons renaissance of her protagonist. Calling Life After Life a highbrow Groundhog Day, as some critics have called it, is grossly oversimplifying a beautiful and rare story. Atkinsons tale is not funny nor is it farcical, and Ursula does not relive the same day over and over again. In Life After Life, Atkinson takes drama to a whole new level. As Ursula says in the novel, To have a character that changed and developed as it went along so that you had no idea how it was going to end up, how you were going to end up. She may as well be talking about herself and about anyone who reads this noteworthy tale. Part mystery and part historical fiction, Life After Life will completely immerse you because it is such an intriguing story and because it is so darn wellwritten. At turns dark, witty, sharp, clever, and poignant, Life After Life produces an unforgettable, unlikely heroine who proves just what a difference one life can make. Life After Life left me spent, breathless, and eager to read it all again.
FINALLY So I first came across this book during the summer of 2014. I added it to my TBR pile and yes I may have stalked the authors page waiting for more news, but it was like radio silence. Well, I had the privilege and pleasure of meeting her in Florida when I attended a book signing. Of course after I fan girled I got down to the nitty gritty, where the heck is King? She politely told me that she was writing it but stopped writing because she was pregnant and it wasnt coming to her. I really didnt get it then, but after reading this dark book, I totally get it, and lets just say it was so worth the wait. Here is my journey with King. You start with a twelve year old King. Hes home life sucks, hes ready to take on the real world, deciding at the ripe old age of 11 that he isnt going back home. While he is pondering what to do he comes to the rescue of Preppy. I have to say this, Preppy is without a doubt my favorite secondary character in a book. Hands down! Poor Preppy is being beat up by the school bullies, well that is until King steps in making his presence known. So now these two somehow form a friendship and make plans for the future. At 12... What are you gonna do when you grow up? The only thing I really knew was I didnt want. Not sure. I just know that I dont want to work for anyone. Never liked being told what to do all that much. Id like to be my own boss, run my own shit. At just like that their futures were set in stone. True to their words they became their own bosses. Ok, well maybe not that successful, but none the less they answered to no one. Ever. Preppy got bitches. I fcked. I fought. I partied. I got wasted. I stole. I fcked. I tattooed. I sold dope. I stole guns. I stole. I fcked. I made fcking money. And I fcked. Obviously this meant that he did spend some time behind bars. But it also meant that when he got out it was going to be a party. And no one does a party like Preppy and King. Its at his homecoming that he meets Doe. Homeless. Hungry. Desperate. That is who Doe is. Imagine if you will. Waking up in a dumpster, beaten and your memory blank. You have no idea who you are, you have no idea where you come from, you have no idea of anything except who you are today. Doe broke my heart. Her journey gutted me. What happens when the police tell you that they dont know who you are, they have no idea how old you are, and they could basically care less where you are going or who you are going with. After a brief stay at a group home, she hits the road. Thinking there must be something better out there. Curled up under a bench she meets the lady who will make her life hell. Nikki, addicted to any drug that she can get her hands on, she brought Doe into the mix. Now although Doe didnt remember where or who she was, she knew she wasnt a drug addict. I may have been homeless and starving, but I was determined to get myself off of the streets and into a real life someday. A life with a soft bed and clean sheets. Once I didnt have to worry about my safety or my stomach, I could focus on finding out the truth about who I really was. Of course that was until she set eyes on King. A magnetic pair of eyes locked onto mine. Under the artificial lights, they glowed bright green. The man stared right through me and much to my surprise he didnt blink or look away. It is just one look that will seal their fates. You see King likes what he see, and when King wants something, well no one is telling him no. Not even Doe. When a situation pits him against her, he doesnt know what to do. He isnt used to having feelings about things, least of all a girl that he met five minutes ago. But something calls to him, something in him wakes up. I dont even know your name, I whispered. I managed to stay conscious long enough to hear his answer. They call me King. Then the blackness surrounded me and swallowed me whole. Pushed up against the wall he had no choice but to do the right thing. But when your King, what is the right thing in his world?. I splayed out a hand on her concave stomach, the heat from her core radiating onto my thigh making my dck even harder. I propped my head up on my elbow and found myself fascinated at the contrast between us, her pale and perfect, to my tanned and heavily tattooed. That right thing to him is to let her go. Push her out into the world, the world that she doesnt even know. The world that turned its back on him. But the minute she is gone, he cant seem to let her go, and the craziest thing is she cant walk away from him. He was the most terrifyingly beautiful thing Id ever laid eyes on. With my fear of dark, things always seemed scarier at night when my mind had a tendency to exaggerate the situation. But in the daylight King was more everything. More intimidating, more scary, more angry...more beautiful. When King actually lets her in, its a beautiful love story. Its a story you wish you could see in real life. This beautifully souled woman who has no history is making today a memory. She is filling in the dark holes in her mind. She is making a life. But what happens when with one click of a mouse, with one word, her life comes back to her? Not in her memory but in the flesh; when that door opens and your past comes running to you, but you dont know them. And then what happens when the one person you trusted the most is the one who wanted to let you go? King filled me so completely. Not just my body. My heart. My soul. My life. I didnt give a sht if I ever got my memory back. Because with King, I knew exactly who I was. I was his. What happens when you make a deal with the devil? What happens when you give away the one thing you know can make you whole, for the one thing that is your life? You fight, you come back swinging harder then you did before. Because in the end, its your King. You make your mothercking future!! So if youre looking for a book that will hurt your heart, make you gasp, make you send many messages to the author, make you swoon, make you hope for better and also make you wish you knew a King, then read this book now!! I cant wait to find out what is in store with these two!
Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog Pivot Point by Kasie West Book One of the Pivot Point series Publisher: HarperTeen Publication Date: February 12, 2013 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC won from a giveaway Summary from Goodreads: Knowing the outcome doesnt always make a choice easier . . . Addison Colemans life is one big What if? As a Searcher, whenever Addie is faced with a choice, she can look into the future and see both outcomes. Its the ultimate insurance plan against disaster. Or so she thought. When Addies parents ambush her with the news of their divorce, she has to pick who she wants to live withher father, who is leaving the paranormal compound to live among the Norms, or her mother, who is staying in the life Addie has always known. Addie loves her life just as it is, so her answer should be easy. One Search six weeks into the future proves its not. In one potential future, Addie is adjusting to life outside the Compound as the new girl in a Norm high school where she meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive artist who understands her. In the other path, Addie is being pursued by the hottest guy in schoolbut she never wanted to be a quarterbacks girlfriend. When Addies father is asked to consult on a murder in the Compound, shes unwittingly drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything she holds dear. With love and loss in both lives, it all comes down to which reality shes willing to live through . . . and who she cant live without. What I Liked: Well, after months and months  actually, years  of pushing this book off, Ive finally read Kasie Wests debut novel! I got this book in December 2012 I actually won it from Jennifer, so, thank you, Jennifer!. I kind of saw a spoiler about the ending, and that ruined the book for me. A year and a half later, my friend Pili insisted that I read this book, as my PiliPushed book recommendation of the month. Guess what, you all? I LOVED THIS BOOK!! I think it was the motivation from reading and loving one of Wests other books that really solidified my intentions of reading this book once and for all. As many of you know, I read my first West book  On the Fence  and really loved it. I have no doubt that I will enjoy Split Second and The Distance Between Us, now that Ive really enjoyed two of Wests four published books. Addie has the ability to Search decisions in her future. She can explore the two paths of that decision in the future, and then choose which path is favorable to her. Like, whether or not to turn down Bobbys invitation to the dance. Or... which parent to live with, when they decide that they need to get a divorce. With Mom, who is staying inside the Compound for paranormals, or with Dad, who is leaving the Compound to live in the Norm world. So, Addie decides to Search her future of both paths. This book is entirely that  a flipflop between one path and the other. At first, I was confused. The very beginning is present time, in which Addies parents tell her that theyre getting a divorce. Addies friend Laila convinces Addie to Search her future, and Addie does so, for six weeks in the future. This book alternates between Addies life with her mother in the Compound, and her life with father outside of the Compound. Each chapter alternates between the two different paths. There are two paths, two parents, two lives, two boys... I actually really liked this type of hypothetical story. This entire book is hypothetical, and Addie must choose a path, once her six weeks in the future is over for the real world, real time, its like, five minutes of a Search. I liked the alternating chapters. I ESPECIALLY loved seeing the paths getting closer and closer... until they finally intersected. Of course, one path couldnt directly overlap and leak over. But it was so cool to see one scene in two different paths. I love how West weaves a good story and mystery in this book. It isnt just about what Addies life will be in each path. Addie must assimilate to the human world in one path, or get used to being a goldenbuy, footballers girlfriend in another. But there is something eerie about both futures. Something doesnt add up, and its not just the football. Trust me, youll get it when you read the book. In the path with Addie living with her mother, Addie develops a relationship with Duke, the Compounds star quarterback, and eventually, they start dating. The very first scene of the book features Duke. Duke is persistent and patient, terrible and hilarious. I liked him from cover to cover, despite some things that should have made me hate him. In the path with Addie living with her father, Addie develops a friendship with Trevor, a former quarterback for the high school Addie attends. They develop feelings for each other, but Addie pushes them down, knowing that she cant tell Trevor who she really is, that she cant really be herself with him. Living in the human world is a really difficult adjustment for Addie, and she almost blows her cover many times. Anyway. I really liked Trevor. His relationship with Addie seemed more real to me, than Dukes relationship with Addie. And I like Addie. Shes a lot like me, or were a lot like each other, whatever. I guess that makes me a toogood girl, which is fine. Maybe hot quarterbacks will drool over me and my wonderfully good self. Actually, Im hoping it will be sexy center forwards. Or any soccer player, for that matter. Anyway. I really liked the worldbuilding in this book. We get life in the Compound, we get life in the human world. West does an EXCELLENT job of showing us how different life in the human world is for Addie. Things like door keys and contact lenses are weird for her in the Compound, doors open because a scanner scans your retinas, and no one has imperfect vision, so no need for contact lenses. So Im really excited to read the next book! This book ended with Addie coming out of the Search, and choosing a path... I wont tell you which path she chose. The six weeks that Addie lived in the Search ARE included in this book too, but since we already know what happened in that path, West doesnt repeat it all. Its the epilogue, which was smart. Now, book two! I want to read about the aftermath! What I Did Not Like: Usually, I would say the love triangle, because there IS one girl and two guys interested in the one girl... but there really isnt a love triangle. I wont say anymore. But remember, this is coming from the girl who HATES love triangles. I cant think of any other dislikes. I cant think of any, period. Would I Recommend It: I would most definitely recommend this book! If youve read any of Wests books, then you KNOW. If you havent read any, read ALL OF THEM. You wont regret it. This one is paranormal  it reminded me a lot of Natalie Whipples Transparent although, Transparent came out after Pivot Point. I read Transparent first though., with the girl having superhuman abilities and living in the real world. This is a great paranormal novel! Rating: 4 stars. I really should have read this book sooner, and not paid attention to what I read about the ending! Of course, what I read was true, but I shouldnt have let it ruin the book for me. Check out my review of book two, Split Second, next Friday August 1st!
Read more of my reviews at Cornerfolds.com! Initial reaction: A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015  possibly even my number one. I have been notsopatiently waiting on A Court of Mist and Fury literally since book one ended and obviously preordered a copy as soon as I could! Upon receiving it in the mail, I quickly started reading but didnt want to read it too quickly. This is one of those books you also want to savor! Especially knowing that Ill have to wait an entire year for the final book in the series. Before I jump into this review, let me say that I do not think Sarah J. Maas can do no wrong. I read the first two books in her Throne of Glass series before giving up on that one. But THIS series... In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection. This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyres character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them. As Im sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a team and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly TeamRhysand at this point and I dont see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering thats what most YA fiction gravitates towards. Relationship spoilers: I need to just take a minute here to fangirl over the relationship between Rhysand and Feyre  THIS is what love is. I love so much that Rhys gives Feyre every single bit of room she needs to heal and then some! He allows her to be her own person from the beginning of this book. Yes, he did some despicable things in ACOTAR, but yes, they were justified in this book. Usually I cannot stand the justification of borderlineabusive behavior, but Under the Mountain was a very unique situation and I can fully forgive Rhys for everything he did, especially knowing now that he always knew that they were mated and did literally everything within his power to protect her in the long run. Now, Tamlin... I know a lot of people have complained that he is totally out of character in this book, but is he really? I did a reread of ACOTAR right before this came out and I can totally see his extremely controlling tendencies. I believe he had to keep it in check if Feyre was going to break the curse, but he was always extremely controlling of her from the very beginning. Does anyone else remember all the times when he said he just couldnt control himself and had to apologize for things? Does anyone else remember when they were going to have sex and he told her he couldnt stop if they went any further? Bullshit. I think that once Feyre had broken the curse and Tamlin no longer needed her help, he was able to show how extensive his controlling nature went and I, for one, am SO glad that Feyre escaped from him! And then theres Lucien. I know there are a lot of mixed feelings about Elain being his mate, but I am super excited to see where this goes in the next book! I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses. One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury and honestly, there are so many was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. Ill admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page. And then theres the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heartwrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As Ive already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with  mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600 pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didnt. There wasnt nonstop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldnt name anything that served only as filler. Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but Im totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, its not out of the question that theyre probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think its important to point out for those readers who perhaps dont want to read steamier scenes. Im sure you could easily skip past them. As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I dont have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling. I honestly cannot go on without becoming a total fangirl so instead Ill leave you with what I have dubbed Rhysands theme song youre welcome.
Im forcing myself to write this review before I start The Dream Thieves so that my thoughts will stay uncontaminated and only relate to The Raven Boys. As I basically state in every review now, Im someone that focuses a lot on characters. Depending on how well written they are, they can totally make or break a book for me. A book with great plot and writing but with flat characters wont get 5 stars from me. Now about The Raven Boys: amazing characters, amazing, skillful writing. Ill write more about the single characters below, but just know that I was hooked on them and their dynamics and interactions with each other from the very beginning. Im talking 10ish into the book. And that rarely happens. Paired with Stiefvaters amazing writing, I knew I was going to like this series right away. Lets talk about the plot though. First of all, for some weird reason I didnt realize until I started reading that this was set in our world. I had read the blurb a couple of times and I guess I should have understood that it wasnt a completely fictional world when it talks about private schools and stuff, but still I thought it was a high fantasy. I dont know how my mind works. So I guess I was surprised at first, and its a good thing that I was already hooked on the characters, because honestly Im not a huge fan of paranormal plots. I wasnt really interested in the ley lines thing at the beginning, and to be honest I still feel that way about it now that Ive finished the book, but I accepted it as what moves these characters forward. As I said, big charactersfan here. I liked the Latinspeaking trees though, those were cool. Although I didnt get why they also knew English words like wait and boy by the end. Going into the rest of this series I hope I can become more invested in the plot itself. Also, I have one word for describing the way the plot moves forward in this one: unconventional. You know how in every YA series you have the big plot that drives the series, and then a smaller plot that drives the single book, and you get most of the answers about the small plot at the end of each book, and whats left unanswered just goes to feed the big plot? Yeah, that doesnt happen here. Almost nothing was solved in this book. All the things that I thought were going to be solved by the end of this first installment are actually still pretty much unsolved. Basically the only thing that got answered was the Noah Thing. Needless to say I was really puzzled by this. The ending was kind of abrupt and I had to go read an indepth summary written by Maggie Stiefvater herself to see if I missed something, but it turns out she probably wrote it like that to mess with my head. Gee, thanks. Anyway. I slept over it and Im actually okay with it. Good thing all the books are out and I can jump straight into the next one, but I think I would have been very sad had I read this back when it was the only one out. I want to spend a few words on the main characters: Blue: I actually dont have too much to say about her. I liked her and she didnt feel like your usual YA heroine. I liked the relationship she has with her mother and the other women in her house, and I found her friendship with the boys very realistic and although this had the potential to be very lovetriangley it wasnt that way at all. In fact theres almost no romance in this first book, which Im really glad about. Not that I dont like romance, on the contrary. But this felt more real than any romance Ive ever read about. She kinda likes Adam, and Adam kinda likes her, but theyre also okay not doing anything about it, and maybe Gansey also likes her, and shes scared because of the killtheloveofyourlifething and the vision shes had in the tree, but the romance is never what drives the story, and that makes me happy. Gansey: You just have to love how stupid he is about money and how the world works. I love his dynamics with the group. He feels responsible for Ronan and Adam and I think he understands why they feel pissed about it sometimes, but he also doesnt know how to stop wanting to take care of things. I mean honestly, I think if we were that rich we would all want to help our friends out in every possible way, especially when some problems can be solved by money. Still, he is a disaster sometimes. My words are unerring tools of destruction, and Ive come unequipped with the ability to disarm them. I had a huge problem with his name for the first half of the book. I kept forgetting it or adding letters to it. It was a bit distracting but I got it now. Adam: Adam was very good at watching without being watched. Only Gansey ever seemed to catch him at it Adam is by far my favorite character. I enjoyed his PoV the most and also most of the quotes I highlighted on my iPad were about him. When Gansey was polite, it made him powerful. When Adam was polite, he was giving power away. I was heartbroken when we found out about his father beating him, and I felt the representation of the way abuse messes with ones head was very real and I could personally relate to it. I cant wait to see where the next books bring him. Ronan: Ronans smile cut his face, but he looked kinder than Blue had ever seen him, like the raven in his hand was his heart, finally laid bare. I had a hard time relating to him. Hes just a very different person and reacts very differently to how I do, and yet I couldnt help being drawn to him as a character, because I just know theres a lot more to find out about him. His was also the only PoV that wasnt shown together with Noahs, for obvious reasons if youve read the book and judging from the way the book ended, that final line...well I know he will have awesome things in store for us. Im so glad I picked up this series!
Where I got the book: my local library. Ive been asked, more than once, why I read Philippa Gregory if her books annoy me. I may have expressed that opinion once or twice. One of the reasons is that many interesting conversations happen about Gregorys books, notably among readers who like to nitpick dispute the accuracy of her historical claims, and its a shame to get left out. Like it or not, the Plantagenet and Tudor eras are a major locus of interest for HF readers I actually prefer the 19th century and rather wish a PG of this era would arise for me to pick holes in mercilessly enjoy and what with the movies and TV series and whatnot, you get kind of sucked in. The White Princess is chronologically situated at the very end of the Cousins War aka the War of the Roses, being the story or part thereof of Elizabeth of York, whose marriage to Henry Tudor aka Henry VII was intended to legitimize Henrys claim to the throne and put an end to all that nasty infighting between the Yorks and the Lancasters. Of course a marriage alone could never be sufficient to end the dispute; only the TOTAL ANNIHILATION of all York claimants would really make Henry Who? safe on the throne, and thereupon hangs a tale. For those who need a recap, Henry grabbed the crown by ensuring that Richard III got chopped up at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, married Elizabeth who had, according to PG, been Richards mistress, and spent the early part of his reign fathering children to ensure the Tudor succession, raising money by means of nasty taxes, and fighting off people who claimed to be one of the princes who conveniently disappeared from the Tower of London before Bosworth. He succeeded, founding the Tudor dynasty and providing the basis of an entire industry for novelists. PGs version differs a bit from my vague notions about Good King Henry Who Brought Peace and Saved Up Lots of Money So That Henry VIII Could Spend It On Wine, Women and Song But Mostly Women. In The White Princess, Henry and his mother Margaret Beaufort are miserly, paranoid johnniescomelately who basically have no class at all, in contrast to Elizabeth who knows EXACTLY how to nod and smile to the crowd because a shes a York and they were rock stars and b because her parents loved her so shes not insecure, nyah nyah nyah. To digress, I have only watched two and a bit fell asleep episodes of the TV series The White Queen so far but the nutty, anorexic religious maniac portrayal of Margaret Beaufort cracks me up. I swear I actually saw her gibber, hiss and raise her hands in vampire claws at one point. PG is clearly on the side of the white rose. And yes! I give this book three stars! Well, 2.5 really, but I round up. Because: No magic, yippee yippee yippee! I have for so long deplored the way PGs heroines are all witchy and stuff that I must give a star to the almost total absence of magic in this book. It never added anything to the story. Without magic the story lines are much sharper and the historical context clearer. Some interesting hints of themes that got my attention, such as how Elizabeth must have felt when her husband was fighting possibly her brother to secure his throne for her son. And the portrayal of Henrys lack of belief in himself and how Mad Margarets habit of reminding him, evidently every day since babyhood, that he was born to be king was the only thing keeping him going. In fact Henry almost became an interesting and complex character on occasions. Except...seriously?...their first meeting?...OK, now sit on this, woman. Fifty Shades of Tudor Green, anyone? When there was dialogue, it was, at times, good. PG can be an entertaining writer. BUT... Still too much naming of names. Surely, no one can think that this boy is my cousin, Edward of Warwick . . . Yes. I had him walk side by side with John de la Pole, my friend and ally. ALL THROUGH THE BOOK. People dont talk like that. It totally screws up the dialogue, which already suffers from the dread disease known as As You Know Bob: the characters in this novel constantly explain events to each other and expound on their historical significance. Because he wants the support of Spain for his invasion, Henry says shortly. But they will stand as our ally. They will give us their infanta in marriage, and they will capture our traitor blah blah blah. HF readers are not senile old ladies who have to be reminded who everyone is every five minutes, and personally I feel like Im being condescended to every time PG explains to me. SO MUCH NARRATION Too much of this story is Elizabeth telling us And then this happened, and then that happened. And frequently she gets her information second hand, because naturally shes stuck at home while all the good bits are happening elsewhere. It makes the plot way too static. Our Lady of the Comma Splice is alive and kicking. The thing that really spoils PGs books for me is the lack of variation in her punctuation. She is overly fond of commas, which are useful little beasts, but overusing them causes your prose to bob along in sort of dreamy waves, quite relaxing in their way, but after a while you begin to wish for an em dash, or a semicolon, oh how Id love to see a semicolon, are they really going out of fashion, maybe Im a dinosaur, how am I going to bring this sentence to an end, somebody help me, oh thank god a period. Im not saying PG does this ALL the time, but the overall effect of her writing style is a sort of suburban coziness that spreads like a blanket over all the exciting stuff shes writing about and deadens its impact. Still, I liked this one more than the last two or three Ive read. So Im wondering, is the Cousins War series now at an end? PGs confusing website doesnt give us a clue. She could, of course, eke out another book from Elizabeth of York, who isnt dead yet, pairing her story with Catherine of Aragons to pull the Plantagenet and Tudor stories more firmly together. There is, of course, the matter of The Prophecy, which is the only witchyish bit in the book, and could have made quite an interesting theme, but it sort of got dumped on us late in the story instead. Yes, I know Im contradicting myself here. Or perhaps PG will rest on her laurels, put down her Plantagenet pen, enjoy the royalties from her TV series and blow large raspberries at the history police. Which would you prefer?
Her stare burned me from the inside. I wanted to worship her. I needed to. Every inch. I can finally and officially say that Katy and Daemon are one of my favorite couples! Even when Daemon was a douche and jerk to her in the beginning, he was actually like that for a reason and there were always reasons behind it. Even when he felt something for her and liked her in some way just didnt want to admit it or express it, it was sticking with him the whole time, he just had trouble showing it. Jennifer did a wonderful and amazing job with Daemons character and changed him in the best possible way I never really imagined. Oh Daemon Black, what are you doing to me? Nobody in this book is really the same. Theres death, violence, and lots of Daemon and Katy moments. Really, the moments I have been waiting for. Spoilers from Opal below. Just a warning. Unless you dont care or enjoy spoiling yourself : Origin starts off right where Opal left off. Katy is taken from Daemon to be tested and see who she is and how really is, while Daemon is tying to escape the community service and save Katy. Even though a lot of similar things from book 1 are happening, there are still a lot of differences. Even when I thought I would hate Katy a little and would end up always hating Daemon, I really didnt expect any of this. Her beauty struck me hard, like a bolt of lightning right in the chest. I froze there, how how long I dont know, unable to take my eyes off her, and then I took two long strides that brought me to the edge of the bed. Daemon has changed so much since Onyx. I really didnt see it and didnt pay much attention to it, but there were those small moments where his development grew in Katy and I was able to sense a small connection between them. I completely fell in love with him in Opal, and now, hes the sweet and caring guy who will do anything to save the girl he loves, even if it involves burning the whole city down or exposing himself. But when it came to the moments of them being together and enjoying the small time they were able to have, I couldnt stop reading or skim through some parts of their moments. Its not like if its something I completely enjoy reading, it was just something refreshing since I never knew it would actually happen. And let me say, boy do they have some moments. Katy has grown into a teenage who always expected to live her life exploring blogs and building hers while reading and thinking her life would go back to how it was. Well, she never expected this! Shes become a lot stronger and is someone nobody really knows what shes capable of. Shes someone different by a long shot and is still figuring out what she can do and how. Shes turned pretty badass since she risks herself trying to help and doing what she can and feels bad when she cant do anything because she isnt like the rest, but when it comes to being able to expose herself a little and letting go of some of her strength, I was happy to know this little kitten found out how to let her claws out. Blake isnt someone to mention a lot and talk about a lot. He deserved what he got and I was happy and glad it happened. I never liked him since the beginning and didnt trust him. I was on Daemons side even though at times I was confused finding out who he is and if he was different as well. He betrayed everyone and lied to everyone making them believe Chris was a real person when none of it was real. He was an asshole and was finally able to help Katy show her real strength and true power. Oh oh. Dee was finally back to the Dee I have always loved and missed. She was able to forgive Katy and missed her this whole time just was afraid to say it. Even with all the other things happening and leaving her a little broken and upset, she was strong and confident with whatever was happening. I was glad her character grew back and she was able to smile and laugh again, even more. Shes changed a lot and become a different person from who she was before. Shes still the same Dee with the cute but fierce attitude. New characters were introduced and my favorite was actually Archer, out of all. Luc is the same hilarious kid who makes everyone laugh including me because of how he talks and expresses things. Luckily he wasnt the one I expected to betray anyone even though so many betrayals happened. He stayed loyal and was the one who didnt mess with anyone and didnt let anyone mess with him. Archer sounded rude but when he was met by everyone else he was known as someone who actually cared and wanted to leave the place he was in as well. He wanted to live in a different place and be who he is without being caught or being treated differently. Hes different than the rest even though hes a little similar, just win more special abilities. I hope he returns to the final installment and it does look like he will along with Luc, but maybe theres something else awaiting for him. Then again, who was I kidding? When I set my mind to something, I did it. And mind was set. No pussyfooting around it. No point in waiting. It was right. It felt right. And thats what matteredthe only thing that mattered. I was in love with her. I would always be. I dont have much to say. JLA has made me love this series and even though I had to wait until the 3rd book to grow a love for Daemon, love Katy again, and finally be able to see them together, I think it was worth it. Im glad I kept going and didnt wait. I actually finished Obsidian and ordered Onyx right away because I wanted to see if anything new would happen and if my thoughts about the series would change. Not much happened but I didnt stop there, so I ordered the rest and here I am now, wanting to finish the series but not wanting to at the same time. Lux will probably end me because I constantly miss Daemon and Katy since they are so damn cute together. Im not expecting much from their relationship since it has shown so much and been taken to a new level, but I am expecting both of them to work together and see how their final journey will end and how everything will come to an end, to work out. I know Jennifer has done an amazing job with this series, so I have no low doubts but I have small expectations as well. Each involving the journey about to happen and the characters and see where they all will end up.
4.5 The problem with wanting, he whispered, his mouth trailing along my jaw until it hovered over my lips. Is that it makes us weak. Oh the Darkling.... So this book starts off with a bang and jumps right into the enchanting world of Ravka. We follow our lead girl, Alina, who is an orphan as she struggles with a newfound power. Basically this country, which is very reminiscent to Russsia, has been a split up by something called The Fold. The Fold is this stream of complete and utter darkness that spans across a part of the country and has hidden monsters inside. When Alina shows this crazy ability when they enter the fold, shes whisked off to join the Grisha. The Grisha live like utter royalty and they each have different types of abilities. From there the story takes off and goes to some pretty epic places.  Ive been wishing for you a long time Alina, he said. You and I are going to change the world. Leigh Bardugo does a fantastic job of throwing you completely into this world. Right away were giving new words, a map, and shown how this world works. She throws us in, but unravels the world in such a way that its explained as it goes. Its so intriguing that its hard to stop reading and the world is absolutely mesmerizing. However, I was a little confused even though I was enjoying it? I really loved the world building and how she decided to explain it to us but I was still kind of confused and wish it had been explained a little more clearly. Like by the end of this book, I understand most of it, but some of the terms Im still a little confused by. Hopefully that will be cleared up in the next book. Youre shaking. Im not used to people trying to kill me. Really? I hardly notice anymore. Now the highlight of this book for me was the characters. I will say that I did find Alina a little bit annoying, but I can see a lot of potential for character growth, which we already started to see by the end of this one. I didnt like how she was always so down on herself. But I did grow to like her as the story went on. And I loved her friendship with Genya! I thought that was a really nice touch, since she never really had another friend besides Mal. Oh Mal... I missed you every hour. And you know what the worst part was? It caught me completely by surprise. Id catch myself just walking around to find you, not for any reason, just out of habit, because Id seen something I wanted to tell you about or because I wanted to hear your voice. And then Id realize that you werent there anymore, and every time, every single time, it was like having the wind knocked it of me. Ive risked my life for you. Ive walked half the length of Ravka for you, and Id do it again and again and again and again just to be with you, just to starve with you and freeze with you and hear you complain about hard cheese every day. So dont tell me why we dont belong together. He said fiercely. swoon I loved Mal! At first he was just okay to me but throughout the second half the book he really grew into his own. And I love him with Alina!! Im not like you Mal, I never really fit in the way you did. I never really belonged anywhere. You belonged with me. Theyre so cute together! Mal just says all the right things! Ahh! And that ending I was completely dying. I dont care if you danced naked on the roof of the Little Palace with him. I love you Alina, even the part of you that loved him. Now lets talk about THE DARKLING. This was his soul made flesh, the truth of him laid bare in the blazing sun, shorn of mystery and shadow. This was the truth behind the handsome face and miraculous powers, the truth that was the dead and empty space between the stars, a wasteland peopled by frightened monsters. Am I crazy for still loving him? Hes so MYSTERIOUS AND COMPLEX. So many different layers. Hes so twisted but such an interesting character. I went from swooning over him to being nervous around him, then swooning some more, and then frustrated and mad at him. All of the emotions over one character in a book thats just over 350 pages. All the awards to Leigh Bardugo on that one. The Darkling slumped back in his chair. Fine, he said with a weary shrug. Make me your villain. Hes definitely just someone that you love to hate in the best way. I cant wait to find out more about him and hoping for some awesome character development. Did you tell him what I showed you in the dark? ugh why does he have to be so evil and so hot Then that EPIC ENDING!! I loved how the beginning came full circle to the end of the book. It was so perfect! Leigh Bardugo really did an amazing job with twisting your emotions all over the place. I was actually terrified of the idea of the Fold but then towards the end my emotions did a complete 180 towards it. Why can a Grisha possess but one amplifier? I will answer this instead: What is infinite? The universe and the greed of men. Overall this book was a great start to what is definitely going to be an awesome and epic series. Cant wait to read more! Mal, I whispered into the night. What? Thanks for finding me. Always.
4.5 stars. Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog The StarTouched Queen by Roshani Chokshi Publisher: St. Martins Griffin Publication Date: April 26, 2016 Rating: 4 stars Source: eARC from NetGalley Summary from Goodreads: Cursed with a horoscope that promises a marriage of Death and Destruction, sixteenyearold Maya has only earned the scorn and fear of her fathers kingdom. Content to follow more scholarly pursuits, her world is upheaved when her father, the Raja, arranges a wedding of political convenience to quell outside rebellions. But when her wedding takes a fatal turn, Maya becomes the queen of Akaran and wife of Amar. Yet neither roles are what she expected. As Akarans queen, she finds her voice and power. As Amars wife, she finds friendship and warmth. But Akaran has its own secrets  thousands of locked doors, gardens of glass, and a tree that bears memories instead of fruit. Beneath Akarans magic, Maya begins to suspect her life is in danger. When she ignores Amars plea for patience, her discoveries put more than new love at risk  it threatens the balance of all realms, human and Otherworldly. Now, Maya must confront a secret that spans reincarnated lives and fight her way through the dangerous underbelly of the Otherworld if she wants to protect the people she loves. Inspired by Indian mythology. What I Liked: The StarTouched Queen is one of my most anticipated debuts of 2016  and novels of 2016 in general. Its one of those books that seem brilliant and a musthave, given a gorgeous synopsis, genre, and cover. Everything about this book appealed to me since I heard about it, so you best be sure I was both excited and nervous to start reading it. But Im really happy that this book did not disappoint! The stars have cursed Mayavati her whole life. With a dark horoscope hanging over her head, she knows that she is destined to have a marriage of death. Maya is comfortable with not marrying anyone, but a sudden turn of events changes everything, and Maya finds herself married to the Raja of Akaran, Amar. Akaran is part of the Otherworld, and Amar is no mere mortal. Maya will soon understand what it means to be the Rani of Akaran  for better and for worse. First thing Id like to gush about  the Indian influence! Im Indian so Im very excited about the Indian mythology and culture so heavily infused into this book. FINALLY, we have a female protagonist who isnt some goldenskinned beauty  Maya captures a somewhat typical Indian girl of dark skin. And while the concept of an arranged marriage is somewhat present in the book, I love that it is not the cliche that we usually see in Indiabased books. So often authors will pick and choose certain aspects of Indian culture to write about  or exaggerate  and often its arranged marriages. There is so much more to Indian history and culture! I think the author did an excellent job with the diversity. Usually Im not interested in stories that deal with reincarnation, whether in a major way, or tangentially. However, I love the aspect in this story. At one point in the story, Maya gets to see all of her past reincarnations, and its a beautiful thing. I really liked Maya, though not necessarily at first. At first, I was wary of her; she put too much stock into her horoscope, and she let all of the harem wives get under her skin, even after so many years of the snide comments. But I like how Maya embraced her horoscope, and how she took charge of her destiny when she meets Amar. Everything changes when she meets Amar. Amar is somewhat of a static character in the book. Hes kind of onedimensional and not entirely there. Its obvious that he does not share the story with Maya, in that it is not his story to tell or his character that is developing. This story is solely about Maya and her journey, and Amar plays a role. I wish we got to know a deeper, more personal side to Amar. I liked Amar a lot and would have loved to understand better, and get to know more personal details about him. Amar is sweet and protective, yet secretive and mysterious. This story had a Hades and Persephone feel to it hence why Im tagging it as a retelling. Amar did not kidnap Maya to the Otherworld, but by her going with him, she agrees to rule the Otherworld with him. And what she finds in the Otherworld, and the Night Bazaar, isnt what she expected. Learning about Akaran is difficult, as is staying away from temptation. I liked the romance! Its a linear one no love triangle, and the story takes place over many years Amar and Maya dont age in the Otherworld, so while we may not see all of the development of the relationship, we know that they spend a long time getting to know each other. Parts of their story are so heartbreaking, and other parts are so happy and sweet. I lived for the sweet moments! I love the cadence of the story. I was never bored, and the author always had me turning pages and eagerly awaiting the next scene. I picked up this book in the height of midterms, and yet, I could not put it down and thats saying something  usually Im very disciplined when it comes to midterms and studying. Overall, I was swept away by this beautiful story. Its a standalone, and certainly wraps up like one. I was satisfied with the ending, though I can see why the author is writingwrote a companion novel to follow in a different characters perspective. I cant wait to read her story! What I Did Not Like: I already talked about this a little above, but I wish Amar was less static and onedimensional. Maybe it was just me that saw him that way. We dont get a ton of backstory about him, besides some of his interactions with Maya. And he never quite felt real to me, just a man filling a certain role. He literally could be anyone, any face, any male. I also wish there were more AmarMaya moments! Trust me, they spend years together they dont age in the Otherworld, so we know that all these swoony and cute moments exist theoretically, but we only get to see... a bare minimum. Like, less than five, I think. Not enough! More swoon and fire would have been great! Would I Recommend It: I highly recommend this novel! Its a beautiful and heartbreaking and lovely story with a very satisfying ending. Chokshi hit all of my feels with this book, and took my emotions on a rollercoaster. I certainly wasnt expecting that! I liked this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone who likes YA fantasy andor mythology! Rating: 4 stars. This novel did not disappoint me at all. I look forward to reading the companion novel that characters story is going to be fantastic, I can feel it!, as well as more books by the author in the future!
Ron Howard already has his hands on this book; so my advice to you: hurry up and preorder this one so you can have it read before its out in theaters! If you want to find out who The Girl Before is youll have to get on this fast ride and endure some whiplashing turns...Ill bet it wont be who you think it is, though you meet her early on, and overlook her in a way... I thought I knew within the first few chapters, but I was wrongand Im not telling, sorry. One Folgate Street seems to be the perfect place for those wanting a decent home, yet cant afford one... but it has a strange ability to change its residents.... The house was designed that way... with a computer system running all the facilities, and interrupting lives at the most inopportune moment, with questionnaires to answerto see if the tenants are progressing properly. This computer system, called Housekeeper had several beneficial aspects to the home owner...recognizing who was in the shower, and their water preferences, noticing the amount of REM sleep they got, checking their stress levels....and more. Two women are each searching for a place to begin again. Emma, wants security after being violently burgled. Jane has just suffered the stillbirth of a perfect child due to hospital neglect, and needs to move on after quitting her highpaying job, and more importantly, leave the constant reminders that fill her present home of poor little Isabelle. The major problem both face are the terrible price of London flats, and the horrible state of those they can afford. Enter Edward Monkford, a gorgeous, controlling perfectionist with plans for his architecture to change the lives of those who inhabit his pristine, mausoleum like, architecture. His idea of architecture and life had changed drastically after the tragic death of his wife and son on the grounds of the building site, but few know of the ancient Japanese ritual that also took place there.... This house is built of only the best materials and is stunningly beautiful in its minimalism. No wonder its won awards. The walls are smooth pale stone, all appliances and fixtures hidden from the naked eye...Usually only the rich can afford his places, so why is this place so cheap? Because theres a catch. It begins with a huge questionnaire, with numerous, often seemingly odd questions that must be answered by any prospective tenants. Once finished with that process they are then made aware of a lengthy list of rules that would make life unbearable for most, even if smitten enough with the pristine, beautiful, award winning property to sign the list of rules including no throw pillows, personal pictures, or books, just to name a fewthis house is meant to bring order, peace, and better overall health to the lives of those who live inside. There were other rights to sign over in the lengthy smalltyped package, a contract that the exhausted hopeful applicants rarely had the energy left to read closely. The final request was to send three recent pictures upon submittal. There was no secret that most hopefuls are quickly rejected by emailthat precious few make it through the lengthy process and acquire an interviewthe last hurdle. Not until later does someone take notice of a striking resemblance the accepted tenants bearnot only to each otherbut also to Edwards dead wife. All attractive, with the unusual combination of dark hair, porcelain skin, and deep blue eyes. Emma and Jane both have that advantageous resemblance, and cant believe their fortune when chosen to live in this stunning, albeit artfully sparse, masterpiece house for only a pittance. They have no idea of the plans the architect has for them, and that they have become human guinea pigs. One of the best parts of this book for me is its POV, which is separated by chapters. We have Then: Emma, and Now: Jane. Emma had lived in the house before Jane, but ends up dead. I thought she must be the girl before. In a way she was. When Jane finds out about her, this thriller becomes a chilling mystery. As the POVs are first person, the story of Emma is a bit difficult because she is a very unreliable narrator, causing us to believe her lies, until the story unwinds enough to see who she really is. I loved the way these two stories were interwoven, one picking up quickly where the other had just left off. In no way were these hard to follow, rather the tension mounted as the reader realized there was something strange about their commonality, namelyEdward. I found it ingenious the way they fit together, and especially creepy as on some of the pages there was only a question, either from the computer checkups, or the original form, that was particularly relevant to the situation going on. These chapter endings served to keep me engrossed in the book, feeling the need to read the next one to find out more. Emma moved in with her boyfriend Simonwho passionately loved herafter the burglary that terrified her in her old neighborhood. Most personal items were not allowed in this clean lined house one of the MANY rules, only a few items of clothing, some toiletries. Simon was not crazy to give up his beloved possessions, but Simon loved Emma far more, so he went along with it, as he always went along with Emma, wanting to make her happy. But soon, Emma is changing, she kicks Simon out, whom she thought she needed desperately weeks before. Its then that Edward enters her life....Yet, Emma had another problem: lies. Shes told them to everyone, Simon, the police, the court, and Edward. To get out of the mess some of her lies have caused, she tells more liesabout people, lies that change their lives; and when she ends up dead...no one knows where to turn....the list of suspects is incredibly long, and her case remains unsolved unsolved. When Jane moves in, she is comfortable living in the homes simplicity. Its a new start. One in which Edward also becomes entangled. Soon, she finds out about Emma, and the resemblance as well as the story of Edwards wife. Her time is spent trying to piece together Emmas death. Its a course that leads her into danger. I loved to watch her amateur crime solving, as she meets many of the people from Emmas past; but there are far too many suspects to get her mind around. Her life becomes endangered when the true murderer gains access to her house again...not the one I expected, and a terrifying night of hide and seek follows, with fear around every corner; the reader cant help but hold their breath as the pages turn and mysteries are solved.

This is the future.....health and wellbeing monitored by your domestic environment. Edward Monkford. The computer knows everything about thembut who is watching the computer? Something I wanted to share: I was curious of the type of architecture mentioned in the book, so I researched it. Edward is a creature of habit....and during his time with them, taking both Emma, and then Jane to the structures that influenced his style of architecture. Here are some examples: I am so frustrated that I could not get this picture on here! I feel it shows perfectly the beauty and simplicity of pale carved stone. Mentioned as the inspiration in the book. The beauty that inspired this amazing award winning fictional house that is really the star of the book. If at all curious as to this type of beauty, please click the link below. This first one, with the masses of carved, pristine white stone is how I imagined Edwards architectural style: all beautifully pale in stone, with texture alone being the focus.  This is the second place he took each of them, in turn. A white stone mausoleum, which as an interesting side note, inspired the iconic red telephone boxes throughout England..

The nittygritty: An edgeofyourseat survival story, a brilliant and sarcastic main character, lots of twists and turns, and a fascinating look at our countrys potential for space travel. Seriously, this was the best time I had reading a book in a long time. I mean, Ive read some really good books lately, but The Martian was just so much fun! I wish I had time to read it again, and I wish I could read it again for the first time. I am jealous of all of you out there who havent read it yet, because you have that experience to look forward to. Andy Weir can do no wrong in my eyes, and I hope hes working on his next book right now. When I got back from Comic Con last week and was looking through the event schedule, I discovered that Andy Weir had been on a panel, and I didnt get to see it! Of course, that was before I read his book, so I may not have gone anyway, but Im kicking myself right now. Simply put, if you have any love at all for space travel and exploration, you are going to love this book. In many ways, The Martian reminded me of the 1995 movie Apollo 13, one of my alltime favorite movies, and strangely enough, when I turned on the TV this morning, Apollo 13 had just started playing on TNT! It was fate! I stopped what I was doing and watched the entire movie, which made me want to read The Martian AGAIN. For those not yet in the know, heres the story setup: Mark Watney is an astronaut who has just been stranded on Mars, after the rest of his crew leaves him for dead following an accident that cuts short their mission. Mark tells his story in the form of log entries, using the Martian term sol in place of day to show the progression of time. He wakes up after being severely injured in an explosion and realizes that 1 hes not dead, and 2 hes all alone. This sets the stage for a thrilling survival story as Mark attempts to stay alive in the harsh environment of Mars with limited tools and materialsand foodat his disposal. When a NASA tech named Mindy inadvertently picks up a satellite photo that proves Mark is still alive on Mars, all hell breaks loose as NASAs mission suddenly becomes urgent: instead of mourning the loss of one of their astronauts, they now have the nearly impossible task of trying to bring him home alive. With the other five members of the Mars mission on their way homea grueling elevenmonth journeya decision must be made: is there any way to save Mark? And if so, can the crew of the Hermes help? One of the best parts of this story is Mark Watney himself: a laidback, extremely intelligent botanist who has a sarcastic streak the size of a Martian crater. His ingenuity may feel overthetop and unrealistic at timesI mean, that man can do anything! Hes more MacGyver than MacGyver is! But hes been sent on the Mars mission for a reason. Hes highly intelligent, hes got mad survival skills, and hes trained to think fast and calmly in the face of disaster. I dont think it will be a spoiler to tell you one thing that Mark does: he figures out HOW TO MAKE WATER. I am not joking. And so wateror lack of itisnt really a big problem for him. Oh, dont worry. Hes got a lot of other problems... His sense of humor really shines through, and the book is filled with lines like these: I unraveled Martinezs bed and took the string outside, then taped it to the trailer hull along the path I planned to cut. Yes, of course duct tape works in a nearvacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshipped. I started the day with some nothin tea. Nothin tea is easy to make. First, get some hot water, then add nothin. Its true, you know. In space, no one can hear you scream like a little girl. Ill spend the rest of the evening enjoying a potato. And by enjoying I mean Hating so much I want to kill people. The story would have worked well if wed only had Marks log entries to go by, but the author decided to show three main points of view instead, so we get a much more layered story. The narration cuts back and forth between Marks log entries, the bigwigs at NASA who are trying to decide the best course of action to save him, and the crew of the Hermes, the ship thats traveling back to earth with the other five astronauts. Weir manages to give all his characters depth, and I especially loved the parts with the five astronautsLewis, Vogel, Beck, Johannson and Martinezas they come to the realization that Mark is not dead after all, and they must decide what lengths they are willing to go to in order to save him. The book is filled with technical jargon: mathematics, chemistry, botany and details about mechanical and electrical engineering, all which had the potential to lose me, rightbrained human that I am. But despite the pages and pages of intricate descriptions of Mark fixing things and figuring out how not to blow himself up, I was riveted to the page. Even the details that went over my head couldnt diminish my enjoyment of this story! The pace kept me turning pages as fast as I could. There are parts where you think, Wow, things are going really well. Wait. They cant go well forever, can they? And guess what. They dont. Just when you feel you can breathe a sigh of relief, bad shit starts to happen. Luckily, Mark Watney is pretty good at handling unexpected situations. I didnt know before I started reading The Martian that it started its life as a selfpublished book online, and like many selfpublished success stories, it took several years before it was snapped up by a major publishing house. Now its a bestseller and all set to be a movie next fall allegedly!, starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott and thats one movie Ill wait in line for. My advice? Read the book first. You wont regret it. Big thanks to Blogging for Books for sending me a free review copy. All opinions are strictly my own. This review originally appeared on Books, Bones  Buffy.
It was about 44.5 almost the entire time, but then it made me cry so I decided to round all the way up. Hazel Grace Lancaster is a sixteenyearold who spends her time reading, watching admittedly bad TV with her parents, taking college classes, and dying fromliving with cancer. When she meets hunky, intriguing Augustus Waters at a local support group, shes pretty sure she has found a kindred spirit who not only matches her sense of humor and history with illness, but also counters her reluctance to live a full life and her desire to hunker down in solitude and misery. Shes especially thrilled when he reads and falls in love with her favorite book, but two kids with a history of cancer are an ominous beginning for a Great Teenage Love Story. I dont read a lot of YA, but when I do its usually for a good reason. I read this at The Wifes express recommendation, and Im really glad I did. This is a beautiful sad love story that feels authentic. It seems to defy some of the YA conventions which generally discourage me from reading the genre, and I really enjoyed getting lost in its little infinity for a few days. It just seemed to have an unexpected amount of substance. Hazel and Augustus are a wonderful pair of young lovers, and their relationship feels so genuinely teenage and believable that I never wanted their story to end. They talked and acted like teenagers admittedly very loquacious and wise teenagers, but still, a little sarcastic and snappy at times, but they also loved their parents a full set each! and were presented in a way that made it very hard to dislike them. I feel like the author was somehow able to get into and present the mind of a teenage girl in a way that felt genuine but also didnt make me want to claw my face off coughBellaSwancough. Hazels mind was an interesting place to be: witty, natural, sardonic, but still sweet. Augustus seemed at times too good to be true, but as his character was gradually developed, he seemed like the greatest guy ever and the best part of all: he was attractive and amazing, but Hazel didnt feel the need to tell us that EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. His character was deep enough that the attractiveness came across naturally, she didnt have to keep reminding us or describing his body or hair or eyes. He was hot, but he was much more than that. Even the side characters, even the ones who appeared for only a scene or two, felt believable and interesting, and everyone seemed to have real human quirks. The way they talked sometimes teetered on the line of being kind of annoying modern teen lingo, but it never really crossed it for me. The story was interesting and surprising and of course heartbreaking at times, but it never crossed over to maudlin, which a cancer story can VERY easily do. The way the author handled the reality of living with something you know will eventually kill you was insightful and kind of remarkable, and the ending was sad, but not depressing. It was tragic, but it was also much more than that. I generally had no idea what was going to happen, and each step of the journey was a splendid surprise and some not so splendid... Peter Von Houten, I just never know what youre going to say or do!. Even when things I generally expected happened, I still was somehow surprised. I laughed out loud, I teared up multiple times each, I tore through some pages and I lingered through others, and when it was over I couldnt stop thinking about it. There were some content issues, though apparently pretty minor compared to other YA books, and I thought there was a little bit of a slant against God and religion in general, but I was able to overlook this in the end because, 1 I feel like a teenager with a terminal illness and not much of a foundation regarding the beyond might feel like this sometimes, which is in some ways understandable, 2 it didnt seem malicious, just kind of defeatist and fatalist, and 3 I feel like it was redeemed a little, especially in Augustuss more open worldview, even if Hazel hasnt quite figured it out yet. I admit I agonized a little over my rating of this one, but in the end it totally engrossed me and I wished it didnt have to end so soon, and its not just any book that can make me feel that way. Oh, and as an aside, I did want to mention that the Walt Disney World pedant in me kind of took umbrage at inaccurateoutdated terminology relative to said theme park, but I let it slide in the end. :  This is a splendid book. Ive never had cancer, but I DO remember what it was like to be a teenager in love, and this book is a beautiful and honest and funny and sad presentation of that. Yes, I readily admit when a book makes me cry, and this one did, but it also made me laugh, and I cant seem to get over Hazel Grace and Augustus. I feel like this review hasnt managed to adequately describe how this book made me feel, but I dont know if any review I may write ever could. It was just nice and sad and funny and lovely and snarky and human and good. I wouldnt be at all against reading more John Green one day. P.S. Reading through some of the reviews here, I thought of something to add: Dur, of course its emotionally manipulative though thats not the term I would use, thats kind of the point of cinema and literature. Pride and Prejudice and Star Wars and any Thomas Hardy selection manipulate emotions as much as anything. Thats why we read  to feel things. That is all.  Notable quotes: Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction, which you cant tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal 33. ... the line was quiet but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone 72. You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are Augustus, 123. As Augustus read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once 125. I actually miread this one when I marked it, but I still like it, ha ha. Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin Dutch cabbie, 157. But yes. I believe in Something with a capital S. Always have Augustus, 168. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice... 209. ... and then he broke down, just for one moment, his sob roaring impotent like a clap of thunder unaccompanied by lightning, the terrible ferocity that amateurs in the field of suffering might mistake for weakness 215.
Warning: As always, I try to stay relatively spoiler free. But it doesnt hurt to proceed with caution. Okay, okay, I think Im in love. This book was AMAZING. And I dont say that lightly. I know that, as far as book bloggers go, I am very easy to please and I probably give out way more fivestar ratings than I should if I want people to take my judgment on bookish matters seriously. But I would give this book eleven stars if I could. In a nutshell, ILLUMINAE follows Kady and Ezra as they escape the destruction of an illegal mining colony by hitching a ride with the Alexander and her fleet. However, the company that attacked the mining colony, unwilling to let any witnesses survive, pursues the fleeing ships for months. Matters worsen when a strange illness breaks out on one of the ships and the malfunctioning Artificial Intelligence takes drastic measures to prevent its spread. But the story is much much more than that, so obviously I need to explain to you why I love this book so much I would pry it out of the hands of a crying baby if I had to haha, ahem, just kiddingI would never be that mean to a baby...probably. AIDEN. I. Am. In. Love. With. AIDEN. Although he is a computer AIDEN stands for Artificial Intelligence Defense Analytics Network, he is more than just an amalgamation of algorithms and code. Whether it is his programing or his damaged hardware, his thought processes transcend binary into poetry. There is something so tragic and pathetic about the way he falls for Kady. Actually, theres something so tragic and pathetic about the way he processes the world in general. And when I say pathetic, Im speaking in terms of pathos rather than ridiculousness. He may be one of the main antagonists, but he does not see himself as an aggressor. Always he tries to act in the best interests of the majority, and he constantly justifies and evaluates his decisions. His programing may be cold and sterile, supposedly devoid of human feeling, but there is still something so distinctly moving when he asks himself, Am I not merciful? His thoughts, both in wording and presentation, are works of art, and I daresay he is more human in the end than most of the humans on the Alexander. I think he is hands down one of my favorite characters of ever, and I will probably talk about him so much over the coming year that you will want to duct tape my mouth shut and throw me out the airlock before the end of it. Sorry, not sorry. The Phobos. I actually felt a little misled here because one of the blurbs on the jacket mentioned zombies and I was like, Ooh, yay, zombies. Except they arent zombies, not really. Granted, the people effected by the virus behave a bit like the zombies in The Walking Dead in that they are attracted by sound. But Phobos victims are basically just uber psychotic people. Extremely terrifying, extremely violent, extremely psychotic people. And they are far scarier and far more dangerous than mere zombies. So Im totally not disappointed. As Phobos progresses through their systems, they become increasingly unreasonable, paranoid, and violent. But they retain enough of their intelligence and enough of their humanity to make them far worsemore awful and more tragic. And if you read the book, youll understand why I will always fight panic every time I hear someone say, Dont look at me. There is probably something really deep and symbolic about the Phobos victims behavior, but Im far too busy donning my hazmat suit and barricading myself in my closet to analyze this aspect of the book any further. Kady and Ezra. The story literally begins on the day Kady and Ezra break up. Talk about poor timing. And its fascinating to see where they go from therehow the tumultuous circumstances affect their strained relationship, and how the big, awful things around them help the two to see the small, awful things they have done to each other along the way. Normally Im not a huge fan of romance, but when it comes to Kady and Ezrayeah, I ship it. Also, Kady is a skilled hacker with more than her fair share of sass, and I want to be her when I grow up. Unique Format. As much as I was excited about the formatting of the novel, I was a little dubious for first the first two hundred pages or so. Maybe I was reading too quickly. Maybe it was that the narrative just felt a little different, like I was on the outside looking in. But I struggled to ground myself in the characters heads, and there were times I felt a little vague on the technicalities of the action, like maybe I had missed something important. I sometimes feel this way when Im reading books in FrenchI understand French, but its also not my mother tongue, so theres a bit of a mental lag. Despite my initial mild confusion, I did find myself getting more and more and MORE invested as the story progressed. Now, having finished the book, I can tell you I am entirely sold on this form of storytelling. Its not something I would read all the time because Im fairly certain most authors couldnt pull it off. Its also a style that doesnt lend itself to every story idea out there. But in this case, I dont think any other method would have fit ILLUMINAE quite so wellany other form of narration would have robbed the climax of its power. Woes and Whatnot. Nevertheless, I did have some qualms about ILLUMINE. First of all, this book is censored. All the major swear words are blacked out as a part of the story. And I like what that says about the culture in ILLUMINAE, that awful things can happen and violence can be presented, but God forbid we cuss. On top of that, its also an excellent example of the way censorship backfires. Blacking out or not, there was never a moment where I was unclear what the intended swear word was. Blacking out the vulgar words only draws the eye and the mind to them, thus completely defeating the point. Or maybe that was the point. That being said, there was a good deal of swearing in ILLUMINAE, and while strong swearing doesnt generally bother me enough to make me stop reading, it does make me a little more squeamish about recommending the book to just anyone and everyone. I would rather not sully the virgin minds of innocent younglings. ILLUMINAE also packs a significant amount of innuendo and general crassness. To be perfectly honest, I was planning to give this book a lower star rating for that very purpose because I think the story could have been told just as effectively with significantly less swearing and innuendo. When I give a book five stars, I see it as my giant stamp of approvalthat I will shove this book in the face of anyone who listens. But I also want to be responsible about the books I shove into peoples faces. Which explains why I was initially hesitant. The Ending. So, why did I give ILLUMINAE five stars if Im such a grandma about the language? Im glad you asked that question. I loved the ending. I loved the ending so much I almost cried because it was so beautiful. And I am not the type of person to get emotional over beauty, at all. I just dont. But there are no words for how wonderful the ending was. I know that people often say something like, This story took my breath away, and they generally mean that as a figure of speech. So let me clarify. I literally had to keep reminding myself to breathe for the last two hundred pages or so. This book was so good I could have asphyxiated. It was prefect and intense and mindboggling, and I havent felt so completely blown away by or invested in an ending since I read Enders Game. I cannot stress enough how wellwritten and unique ILLUMINAE is, how authentic it feels, how it carries such a big punch my poor little heart is still bruised. Both in formatting and in story, ILLUMINAE is a work of art. If I could, I would buy fifty million copies to line my walls as decoration. Obviously the sequel, GEMINA, cannot come out quickly enough.
UPDATE Upon further reflection Ive decided to lower my actual rating to 2.5 stars. The more I think about it, the more angry I am at this book. :  Read more of my reviews at Cornerfolds.com! When it was first announced that the script for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child would be published as a book, I was really skeptical. Not only because I dont usually read scripts, but also because the script was not written by Rowling herself. Rather, it was based on an original story by J.K. Rowling. When it came right down to it, though, I knew I had to have a copy of the eight installment of Harrys story. So I grabbed my Ravenclaw robe and my wand and headed to the midnight release party. Over the next few hours I binge read all 320 pages and... well, now I have feelings. This story picks up 19 years after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, right at the same place as the original series epilogue. Harry and Ginny are married with three children: James, Albus, and Lily. The Cursed Child is entirely about Albus, though. The other two are barely mentioned. Of course, Ron and Hermione are also married with children of their own. When this story begins, Albus and Rose, Ron and Hermiones daughter, are beginning their first year at Hogwarts. The nostalgia is back immediately upon reading this very familiar scene, but from there things advance at a breakneck speed. There are several new characters in The Cursed Child, but the most important ones are Albus and Scorpius, Draco Malfoys son, who become fast friends in much the same way as Harry, Ron, and Hermione did in The Sorcerers Stone. I really enjoyed both these new characters and loved the relationship between the two of them! While Albus struggles with living up to the Potter name throughout this book, Scorpius has terrible rumors to contend with, and their similar trials bring the two unlikely friends closer together. One character I didnt much care for was Rose. I wonder if the writers were trying to throw back to how unlikable Hermione was in the first book when they wrote Roses character, but she didnt work for me at all. Old characters obviously have a huge part as well, but it seems as if all of them have become extreme versions of their original characters. For example, Ron is basically the comic relief of the play. There is actually a scene in which Ron, attempting to be threatening, holds his wand facing the wrong way toward a perceived enemy. Hermione is extremely logical, sometimes to the point of being rude. Then theres Harry, the overworked Ministry employee. Ill come right out and say it: I didnt like Harry in this play at all. He was uncharacteristically mean to pretty much everyone. I did love seeing Draco again, though! I mentioned before that the plot itself moves extremely fast and that was another of my problems with this. I suspect it would work better as a play with more time between scenes, more time for characters to speak lines, etc. Unfortunately, this script is all a lot of us have and I feel that it should work just as well on paper since its being sold for 30. Instead it felt like a lot of fan service and throwbacks to the original series crammed into a two part play. Dont get me wrong, the nostalgia was there and it was a fun read at times! I liked getting to see the old gang back together and there were some fun surprises, but there were times I had a hard time accepting that this is canon. There were plot holes and inconsistencies and downright weird bits that seemed totally random. I cant say much about the plot without spoiling it and I definitely think that everyone should go in as spoiler free as I did. Click below if you want to see some of my spoilery complaints: Trolley Witch  What even is this? Never has there been any mention of the Trolley Witch being some kind of 200 year old mystical being with weaponized hands who makes sure kids stay on the train! Whose idea was this because I cannot believe J.K. Rowling did this. Time turner inconsistencies  This is one Ive seen a lot of discussion about around the interwebs and I still dont know what to think. Time turners were a huge part of The Prisoner of Azkaban and Im having a hard time accepting the way this device is used in the plot of The Cursed Child. Harry is an asshole  Excuse my French, but who is this Harry? He certainly isnt the character we all came to know and love over the course of seven books and eight films. Harry would not tell his child he wished he wasnt his dad and Harry wouldnt be a jerk to Professor McGonagall. VoldemortBellatrix love child  Um... why? How? WHEN? This is honestly one of the worst plot devices ever. It reads like bad fan fiction and that makes me sad. No LunaNeville  Seriously though! Where are they?? There are appearances by almost every other major character in the original series and theres barely a mention of Neville and Luna may as well not exist. One other thing I need to mention is the setting and there isnt much of it thats new. All the familiar places from the original series are revisited from Hogwarts to the Ministry of Magic to the Forbidden Forest. Obviously, there isnt much room for description in a script, but I had hoped for some new Wizarding World magic to be introduced instead of rehashing every location of the trios old stomping grounds. Its not that I hated The Cursed Child. In fact, I actually did enjoy most of my time reading it! But at the end of the day, I expected this to be so much more and, actually, so much less. There was too much crammed into such a short book and much of what was there just seemed like fan service. I am glad that I read it and do think that any Harry Potter fan should read it too, simply because J.K. Rowling signed off on it, but it is definitely not up to par with the previous seven books.
this review can be found at Jenna Does Books. I hereby declare CROWN OF MIDNIGHT by Sarah J. Maas the most worthy sequel of all sequels that have ever been written. Alright, perhaps I dont exactly have the authority to make such a declaration, but the beautifullywritten, thrilling and mysterious sequel to the 2012 release, Throne of Glass, is more than deserving of the praise. I read both Throne of Glass and CROWN OF MIDNIGHT in an almost marathon, with only one book in between. I cannot believe I waited so long to start this series! Now that Ive read these first two books, I am already waiting with bated breath for the next installment. The wait each year, until the sixth and at the time of this writeup final book is released in 2017, will be pure torture, I tell you... Pure torture. With that said, I guess youd probably like to know why I love CROWN OF MIDNIGHT so much. I loved this second installment even more than I did the enthralling Throne of Glass, though that feat seemed near impossible at the time I was reading it. For anyone who enjoys good fiction  not just fantasy or magic or historicaltype novels, but plain old good fiction  CROWN OF MIDNIGHT is a mustread. In this single novel you have the perfect combination of an original premise, a wellthought out cast of characters that you can root for as well as despise, a clash of kingdomsenemies and allies, an unpredictable mystery, plenty of romance, action and adventure and so much more. If I had to make a comparison, after reading just the first two installments I can already see the Throne of Glass series doing for young adults and adults what Harry Potter did for kids and adults in the last two decades. What did I like most about CROWN OF MIDNIGHT? Id say the writing, since the book is full of so many quotable passages and is highly readable for any lover of fiction. The descriptions the author uses to develop her world, her mythology and a history of magic are far more convincing than anything else I have read in fantasy fiction lately. Her dialogue conveys the characters personalities and emotions, while allowing the readers to fill in the blanks and develop our own opinions about their motives. The fact that the author excels in her writing style and skills is undeniable, but that is not the only reason I loved this novel... I also loved how solid every single element of the story feels. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT takes the introductions to both the characters and the world from book one and progresses those items into a solid story that, albeit fantastical, we as readers can 100 believe in. Actions and reactions roll off on each other like the swell of waves on steady seas. As with any ocean, those waves must come crashing into the shore at some point. In CROWN OF MIDNIGHT that crash comes with such force, at a point when the reader is most invested in the story, that it feels like the waves are colliding against our own heart. Because the author has created such a solid story, cast and world, both the good and the terrible things that happen within these pages are felt and believed in with every fiber of the readers being. But thats not all... Im always pleased when we get to see a romance progress before the final installment. I also love it when enough time has passed that the romance progresses in a realistic way, rife with uncertainty, passion and discovery. The love triangle that appeared in book one is quickly resolved in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. But that is not to say that things are all unicorns and glitter for our pair of lovers... This book contains plenty of romantic swoons, I cant deny that. But we must keep in mind that were talking about a romance involving a hired assassin for a tyrannical king, so things can and will go wrong for anyone who hopes for happiness... Hoo boy, but I love LOVE that the romance in this book feels just as solid as every other element of the story, despite its ups and downs. Can I just talk about the characters for a moment? There are so many within these pages, both old and new. In Throne of Glass I came to like the four main characters, Celaena, Chaol, Dorian and Nehelemia, as I gradually got to know them. While reading CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, my love for and connection to the characters just exploded! Trust me when I say that Throne of Glass was a mere buildup to the direction in which each of their lives were taken in book two. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT trumps all. Hands down. We see so much more assassin badassery out of Celaena in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. In Throne of Glass, I just wasnt convinced. But now.... NOW I AM. This girl kicks some serious bad guy butt, guys. Celaena balances the fine line between good and evil with finesse, but all the while I love where her heart is in every move she makes. I never thought that I would back a killer as much as I do the young and extremely dangerous Celaena, but there you have it: I totally support every kill she makes and would totally take her on as my own personal Champion. I wish I could go on and on about my love for CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, but since it is full to the brim with surprises and new developments, to say more would be to spoil the story for you. If you have not yet read the first book, Throne of Glass, you really need to get on that ASAP. For those who are eagerly awaiting this installment, trust me, the wait is worth it. Be glad you have yet to experience the awesomeness that is CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. Im sad that I will never again have a first read of it, but then again... I guess there will be at least four more first reads in this series, wont there? Can. Not. Wait.
Not that this really needs to be said anyways because you can already see this above, but The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most solid fivestar ratings Ive ever given in my whole Goodreads career. And this review will be spoilery so if you dont want to know dont go past this point. And, again, my stupid computer shut down on me while I was writing this so now I have to rewrite this all again. Sigh. I got this book totally on coincidence. I was just browsing through Barnes and Noble, not really planning on buying anything, when I came upon three full shelves of The Fault in Our Stars. Even then, I wasnt really planning on buying it shame on me I know what was I even thinking but then I saw that one lone book on the shelf had a bright yellow sticker on it saying, signed by John Green! I opened the book to the front page and saw his signature in green ink. Enjoying the irony, I picked it up and decided to buy it; clutching it to my chest and carrying it up to the counter. And let me say that was one of the best literary decisions of my life. This is how I feel about this book in gif form, just let me tell you: Seriously; Im going to put it in a glass case on top of a red velvet pillow and honor it for all my days I dont really know what else to say besides that this book was amazing. Absolutely incredible. And, personally, I think it was because how close I am to death. My dad died when I was 15 of a sudden heart attack  Here is my review for a book called A Monster Calls that you should also read where I go more indepth about it, for those of you who didnt know, and so many things that Hazel and Augustus went through were reflected in me. The absolute hate she had for people who smoked; wasting perfectly good lungs when she basically had none is my distaste for people who dont take care of their hearts when one visit to a doctors office and a couple of small pills would save their life. When Augustus broke down and admitting that everything wasnt alright; that this wasnt fair, is something that Im still going through in my own life. When they held Augustus funeral in the bottom of the church and had a heartwrenching, grosssobbing, twistyourfaceintothemostdisgustingangelsandfeellikeyourowninsidesaretearingyouapartwhileyouscream mourning was the same thing I went through with my own friends a couple days after he died. And, like Hazel, that was more of my own person funeral for my father than his real one ever was. All of the facebook posts of people who didnt know Hazels Augusts just like they didnt know my father. When they both went to Germany and found out even the person you hold in the highest esteem, is practically untouchable by bad, turns out to disappoint you. The act of doing absolutely nothing important with a person that means everything. The Fault in Our Stars hit me at every emotional angle possible. Props to you, Green. And just the characters by themselves are just so unique and special in their own right, and it was a really tight tie between Hazel and Augustus as my favorite I mean come on that letter he wrote about her at the end ripped my heart out and spread it to the four corners of the earth, never to be seen again., but Hazel still won out just because of who she is. You knew who she was and what she stood for the minute you read her first paragraph in the book, and still kept her core beliefs throughout the novel, even though her perception did change, but whose wouldnt after meeting the man that is Augustus? I loved absolutely every single facet of her. She was the steady rock that guided me through Greens book. And this is all I have to say to her: And Augustus. Oh my baby Augustus. He is everything I never knew I wanted in a male character and more. He also gives a big thankyou from me for everything he did for me and for Hazel, and he was the storm that ruffled her life because, although she was a rock, she was too much of a rock, and he lifted her up so she could reach her full potential and not just keep sinking into the ground from her own weight. They were both just right for each other. And that letter that he wrote at the end had me going: But then I wanted it all at the same time. It was all too much for me. And the fact that they had sex? Just ugh. Thank you for that, John Green. And speaking of that man, his writing alone was like literary porn in a way that I couldnt stop reading it. Heres the first paragraphs: Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death. Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really. But my mom should be adjusted and also I should attend a weekly Support Group. This Support Group featured a rotating cast of characters in various states of tumordriven unwellness. Why did the cast rotate? A side effect of dying. The Support Group, of course, was depressing as hell. It met every Wednesday in the basement of a stonewalled Episcopal church shaped like a cross. We all sat in a circle right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would have met, where the heart of Jesus would have been. I noticed this because Patrick, the Support Group Leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked about the heart of Jesus every freaking meeting, all about how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in Christs very sacred heart and whatever. So heres how it went in Gods heart: The six or seven or ten of us walked wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didnt die and now here he is, a fullgrown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way slowly working his way toward a masters degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life. AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY! Justjust let me hug you, John Green. And the plot is enjoyable, simple, but complex enough that youre still not exactly sure where its going, but that actually excites you. You want it just the way it is. I would not change a single word of the whole book. And, okay, did anyone else think that it was just going to end abruptly like the book inside the book did? Because I sure as hell thought so, and although I still love the ending and would never change it, I was almost disappointed that didnt happen somehow. I cant be the only one that was thinking that, can I? Anyway, this was an incredible book, as per usual for our John Green, and I will treasure if for years to come I wasnt joking about putting it in a glass case, people. And I suppose I will see you all at the next book that makes me cry, an event I look forward to and dread.
FINALLY So I first came across this book during the summer of 2014. I added it to my TBR pile and yes I may have stalked the authors page waiting for more news, but it was like radio silence. Well, I had the privilege and pleasure of meeting her in Florida when I attended a book signing. Of course after I fan girled I got down to the nitty gritty, where the heck is King? She politely told me that she was writing it but stopped writing because she was pregnant and it wasnt coming to her. I really didnt get it then, but after reading this dark book, I totally get it, and lets just say it was so worth the wait. Here is my journey with King. You start with a twelve year old King. Hes home life sucks, hes ready to take on the real world, deciding at the ripe old age of 11 that he isnt going back home. While he is pondering what to do he comes to the rescue of Preppy. I have to say this, Preppy is without a doubt my favorite secondary character in a book. Hands down! Poor Preppy is being beat up by the school bullies, well that is until King steps in making his presence known. So now these two somehow form a friendship and make plans for the future. At 12... What are you gonna do when you grow up? The only thing I really knew was I didnt want. Not sure. I just know that I dont want to work for anyone. Never liked being told what to do all that much. Id like to be my own boss, run my own shit. At just like that their futures were set in stone. True to their words they became their own bosses. Ok, well maybe not that successful, but none the less they answered to no one. Ever. Preppy got bitches. I fcked. I fought. I partied. I got wasted. I stole. I fcked. I tattooed. I sold dope. I stole guns. I stole. I fcked. I made fcking money. And I fcked. Obviously this meant that he did spend some time behind bars. But it also meant that when he got out it was going to be a party. And no one does a party like Preppy and King. Its at his homecoming that he meets Doe. Homeless. Hungry. Desperate. That is who Doe is. Imagine if you will. Waking up in a dumpster, beaten and your memory blank. You have no idea who you are, you have no idea where you come from, you have no idea of anything except who you are today. Doe broke my heart. Her journey gutted me. What happens when the police tell you that they dont know who you are, they have no idea how old you are, and they could basically care less where you are going or who you are going with. After a brief stay at a group home, she hits the road. Thinking there must be something better out there. Curled up under a bench she meets the lady who will make her life hell. Nikki, addicted to any drug that she can get her hands on, she brought Doe into the mix. Now although Doe didnt remember where or who she was, she knew she wasnt a drug addict. I may have been homeless and starving, but I was determined to get myself off of the streets and into a real life someday. A life with a soft bed and clean sheets. Once I didnt have to worry about my safety or my stomach, I could focus on finding out the truth about who I really was. Of course that was until she set eyes on King. A magnetic pair of eyes locked onto mine. Under the artificial lights, they glowed bright green. The man stared right through me and much to my surprise he didnt blink or look away. It is just one look that will seal their fates. You see King likes what he see, and when King wants something, well no one is telling him no. Not even Doe. When a situation pits him against her, he doesnt know what to do. He isnt used to having feelings about things, least of all a girl that he met five minutes ago. But something calls to him, something in him wakes up. I dont even know your name, I whispered. I managed to stay conscious long enough to hear his answer. They call me King. Then the blackness surrounded me and swallowed me whole. Pushed up against the wall he had no choice but to do the right thing. But when your King, what is the right thing in his world?. I splayed out a hand on her concave stomach, the heat from her core radiating onto my thigh making my dck even harder. I propped my head up on my elbow and found myself fascinated at the contrast between us, her pale and perfect, to my tanned and heavily tattooed. That right thing to him is to let her go. Push her out into the world, the world that she doesnt even know. The world that turned its back on him. But the minute she is gone, he cant seem to let her go, and the craziest thing is she cant walk away from him. He was the most terrifyingly beautiful thing Id ever laid eyes on. With my fear of dark, things always seemed scarier at night when my mind had a tendency to exaggerate the situation. But in the daylight King was more everything. More intimidating, more scary, more angry...more beautiful. When King actually lets her in, its a beautiful love story. Its a story you wish you could see in real life. This beautifully souled woman who has no history is making today a memory. She is filling in the dark holes in her mind. She is making a life. But what happens when with one click of a mouse, with one word, her life comes back to her? Not in her memory but in the flesh; when that door opens and your past comes running to you, but you dont know them. And then what happens when the one person you trusted the most is the one who wanted to let you go? King filled me so completely. Not just my body. My heart. My soul. My life. I didnt give a sht if I ever got my memory back. Because with King, I knew exactly who I was. I was his. What happens when you make a deal with the devil? What happens when you give away the one thing you know can make you whole, for the one thing that is your life? You fight, you come back swinging harder then you did before. Because in the end, its your King. You make your mothercking future!! So if youre looking for a book that will hurt your heart, make you gasp, make you send many messages to the author, make you swoon, make you hope for better and also make you wish you knew a King, then read this book now!! I cant wait to find out what is in store with these two!
Review can also be found at My Midnight Musing The Rose and the Dagger takes place almost right at the end of The Wrath and the Dawn. Shazi, has been taken from her home with Khalid, is reunited with her family and finds herself in a war camp set on destroying Khalid and his kingdom. Shazi is caught between a rock and a hard place and while she wishes more than anything to be by Khalids side, her loyalty to her ailing father and determination to find a way to break Khalids curse to stop this impending war prevents her from doing so. It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did not belong to him. It was never about belonging to someone. It was about belonging together. The relationship between Shahrzad and Khalid remains to be my favourite aspect of this series. In The Wrath and the Dawn, they had a push and pull dynamic due to the secrecy of Khalids curse. This book sees them free of that secrecy and in its place we have them working side by side in search of a way to break the curse and stop the war. They are separated for quite some time in the book and I appreciated the way Ahdieh acknowledged the fact that they are still both individuals within the relationship. What was more impressive was seeing Shazi taking charge and standing firm in her love for Khalid despite the fact that everyone around her still believe him to be the monster boy king.Yes, Khalid is far from perfect; he can be ruthless and hot headed, but he is also a man that loves fiercely and is on his way to believing that he deserves to be loved. Hes a complex character and thats what makes him a fascinating character to read about and to root for. Khalid and Shazi are one of my favourite couples in literature. One of the reasons for this is down to the emphasis on the way that Khalid and Shazi are equals in this relationship. Theres a maturity to their relationship. They both respect one another and listen to what they have to say. Its a relationship full of communication, honesty and passion. They both love fiercely and this was highlighted throughout the book. However, the relationship between Khalid and Shazi is not the only one explored in this book. Shazis sister also has a part to play in this tale. Since reuniting with her family, Shazi finds herself wary of everyone around her, as they are of her. Irsa is no different. Upon reuniting with her sister, Shazi is forced to face the fact that Irsa is no longer the naive little girl who is happy to sit around and let Shazi come and go as she pleases. Instead, Isra finds her courage and assertiveness. She urges Shazi to treat her with the respect to be honest with her, no matter how hard the truth may be. I loved watching these two sisters come together again and turn their relationship into one of honesty and respect. Irsas budding relationship with Rahim was also a sweet development. Now, what of Tariq? Well, for the first half of the book he was irritating and was acting more like a petulant child than a man. He made a lot of foolish choices, ones spurred by his own selfishness, sense of entitlement and bitterness. However, we did make some progress around the halfway mark as Tariq was forced to confront the reality of the situation after his choice led to an almost fatal consequence. I especially love how Shazi and Khalid did not hesitate to put him in his place when he crossed the line. While some characters had some great developments, I did feel like certain characters could have benefited from more page time. To start, lets talk about Jalal. I was disappointed in the treatment of his character, especially since he and Khalids relationship took a few hits at the beginning of the book. I would have liked to see these two communicate more and openly discuss the events of what happened earlier in the book. This leads me to Despina. I dont even know where to start with her character. We were treated to some surprising revelations about her but I felt like the exploration of these developments were rushed and we never really got to feel the effects of these revelations. Finally, the war itself fell kind of flat for me. Again, this comes down to the fact that the last quarter of the book felt rushed and we never really saw the developments and seriousness of the war to come because all of the significant events that led up to the final confrontation happened off the page. This also meant that the three figures that posed as a threat to Khalid and his kingdom, Reza, Jahander and Salim, didnt really have a foreboding presence. I was also slightly disappointed with the exploration of the magic system in this book. We get some more insights into the system but I felt like the only time magic was explored was for the sake of developing Shazis character. We know Shazi possess some magical ability in the first book and here we see her trying to learn more about her ability and its manifestation. Here enters Artan. He was a fascinating character as the magic had shaped his and his familys legacy. However, we dont get a lot of information about this magic and I felt like I ended the book with a lot of questions and uncertainties about the magic system in this world. Overall this was definitely an enjoyable sequel. The relationship between Khalid and Shahrzad remains to be the highlight of the book but I also liked the exploration of the sisterhood between Shazi and Irsa. The writing was stunning but I did feel like the last quarter of the book was rushed and some elements of the book werent as fleshed out as Id have liked it to be. I felt like the book could have used an additional 100 pages so we could have the time to tie up these loose ends. Cut the strings, Shazi. Fly.
Actual rating 4.5 stars That was beautiful. This review was originally posted at  I received an eARC of this book from HMH Books for Young Readers via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you! Critically Plot  4 out of 5 stars This is a really great coming of age story about grief and family. A few of the themes involved were friendship, sexuality, love, acceptance and letting go. I probably wouldve read it in one sitting if Id had a physical copy of this book because while its super emotional and powerful, its so easy to get lost in. Writing Style  4 out of 5 stars The writing style of this book is definitely one of its selling points. Its powerful and emotional and intense. Its poetic and raw. Theres a few instances of explicit content but it was so tastefully done that it flowed easily through the story. The narrative was just so honest and real, it was so great to read. Characters  5 out of 5 stars The characters of this book are just so amazing. Theres nothing I love more than a character driven story and this is exactly what the kind of book that does it extremely well. All the characters are complex and complicated, theyre all dealing with so many different things and I loved seeing their individual growth. Grace is such a strong character. Shes had to deal with so many things because of her mom that most people dont have to that its made her kind of closed off. Shes tired of having to pick up the pieces after her Mom. She feels very selfconscious and vulnerable. I connected a lot with her and the responsibilities she felt she had toward her Mom. The side characters in this series are stellar. They each have their own role within the story, but they dont feel like theyre there just for that. Each one is complex and real. Theyre relationships with each other felt so honest. I cant stop saying the word real because I just felt like I had the privilege to sneak a peek into the lives of such amazing individuals and theres nothing better than to find a book that gives you that. Emotionally Ive been hearing nothing but good things about this book since ARCs came out and I am so glad to say that all the people recommending this book are totally right! The plot is intense. We follow Grace, who wants nothing more than a normal life with a reliable Mom. She meets Eva who is dealing with life after the death of her mother and they begin to lean on each other and begin a relationship. Like I said above, I probably couldve read this book in a single sitting and it easily wouldve been 5 stars if I had. It was just such a powerful and emotional story. Its so heartbreaking and raw. Reading was definitely a hit to the heart. The story just revolves around the lives of these characters and theres no real linear plot to follow. We get a glorious glimpse at the struggles and triumphs of these amazing people whom they could totally be in real life. The relationships between the characters are the focus of the story, 100. They are all so complex and real. You have familial relationships, friendships, romantic relationships and relationships between exes. Each one is developed and nurtured and expressed by the author in different ways and as a reader, it was just so easy to be able to imagine this little town with these people and their love or hate or frustration between one another. The story just felt genuine and it was such a joy to read, even with all the heavy topics involved and the heart wrenching things that are part of these relationships. I loved the writing style! I think that was one of the things that made the story so easy to connect with. It was really poetic and lyrical with the way the main character narrated but also so easy to read and simple with the way the story flowed. The author did an amazing job with the way she handled different themes like sexuality, grief and acceptance. As well as, pleasantly surprising to me, masturbation. I thought it was really cool that the author managed to share a very tasteful masturbation scene from the main character and I think its a very important topic to show teens, specially teen girls, that its totally okay to do and that they should accept that. I definitely want and need more books from this cast of characters. I want to read the authors debut also too because the writing was just amazing! The ending was really hopeful and absolutely perfect after such an emotional and impactful story. I just really want more people to read this book. It was just a really amazing reading experience. I really connected with Grace. While I have a wonderful relationship with my mother, I understood the situations she was in and the feeling of having to be a child who takes care of a parent. My mom had an accident when I was a preteen and for a long time, I was my moms mom. So while we were definitely not in the same situations, I understood the emotions Grace was processing and the feeling that you have to be there for that parent even when they cant necessarily take care of you the way they should be. The growth she goes through in this book was absolutely amazing, I loved seeing how she learned and came of age. She started to accept that enabling her mom wasnt helping her and that her life and the dreams she has are just as important as any relationship she has with her mom. I loved seeing her begin to slowly open up with people and to jump over that need to defend her mom even as she complains about her. Honestly, her narrative and her story just hit really close to home and were an amazing experience to read. The side characters of these series are amazing. I loved meeting every single one of them and how they interacted with each other was beautiful. Eva hurt my heart. I felt so much for her. Shes such a beautiful girl. I loved that she was biracial but wasnt sure how to feel about some side of that identity. Shed never known her father and his family so she didnt really know how to feel about being halfwhite. I loved her love for dance and how she struggled with how to express that love since it was so connected to her mom and their relationships. The relationships between her and Grace was just so beautiful. It was tentative and sweet. They had such a comforting connection and I loved how they could support each other. IT WAS JUST SO AMAZING OKAY?! I loved it. Luca was really amazing. I have the kind of friend that Luca is for Grace and it was so great to see that in a book. Not only between a guy and girl but just in a YA book, friendships are just as important as romances in my opinion. They got mad at each other and had arguments and disagreed but that never divided and they are like family to each other. I just loved that about their relationship. Another great character that I want to mention is Emmy. Shes Lucas mom but she was kind of like a mom to every young character in this book. I loved the way she tried her best to look after Grace and Eva, whether they wanted her to or not. I know a lot of amazing women who have that same relationship with me and I loved seeing it represented in this book. Overall, this book is amazing. The plot isnt linear, but it feels like a glimpse into the lives of these wonderful and tangible characters. The romance was really sweet and all the different relationships between the characters were complex and organic and resonated with me in some way. I loved all the characters and now I want to read this authors debut and any future books shell release because her writing style is absolutely beautiful.
Well, that was certainly worth the wait. Half Wild was an excellent follow up to Half Bad, a book I very much enjoyed. I think to really connect with this series you have to connect to the characters and especially Nathan and I can totally see how the series isnt right for everyone, but personally I love it and I think Nathan is such a unique character and so vastly different from male protagonists Ive read in the past. I like the dichotomy between him being this very vulnerable and emotional person and also him being capable of murder and other horrible things not that I like him killing people, I just find it interesting how he reconciles having to. I just find him to be absolutely fascinating, being in his head is never a boring experience to me. Seeing him come into his Gift as a witch was really cool as well, if sometimes a little scary. The other character I must fangirl about extensively is Gabriel. Uhg, he is just a pure beautiful soul who is too perfect for this world. No but really, Gabriel might actually be an angel, I dont see any evidence to the contrary. He is so loyal and understanding and compassionate. He stands by Nathan no matter what, he will love Nathan no matter what he does. He never turns away from him even when Nathan hurts him, even when he does something hes ashamed of. Their friendshiprelationship is one of my favorite things about this series because it feels so natural and real. Plot wise it could have been stronger. There wasnt really a clear structure or goal outside of the forming of this Alliance to take down the Hunters and make Europe a safe place for White and Black witches to coexist. So theyre pretty much just putting this Alliance together for most of the book and then staging attacksraids on Hunters. The ending felt a little rushed and anticlimactic. I realized I had ten pages left and was like well what could possibly happen in ten pages and I guess it does take an unexpected turn at the end and totally changes how Nathans mindset will be in Book 3 but I wished it had a more concise story that had the rising action and falling action rather than just being kind of plateaued for much of it. Not to say it wasnt entertaining and well written because it was, I just wished I had gotten a little bit more out of it. As with many YA novels there is the romance factor to discuss. One could say this trilogy has a love triangle and I guess they would be right. Im not one who hates on every love triangle, I think they can be done in a way that lends to the overall plot of the series and the development of the characters and I think this one is done pretty well. Although I must say I cannot stand Annalise, I didnt mind her in Half Bad but hearing Nathan pining over her nonstop just grated on my nerves. Everything was always about Annalise all the damn time. I almost wished she never woke up from that magical coma thing. For a book with such great characterization I find that she is the weakest and most bland character, I still have no idea what her personality is or why her and Nathan even like each other let alone love each other. For the rest I will have to get into some spoilers but if you liked Half Bad or if you havent picked up this series I would recommend it! So the end. Fucking Annalise I swear to god, I was so happy when she was the one who shot Marcus because Nathan is hopefully not going to be very forgiving of that. But I guess you cant really blame her since she was trying to protect her brother. Also Nathan did kill her other brother. Much murder. Im just hoping in Book 3 the NathanAnnalise thing is done because it got so annoying at a certain point. She is totally his Manic Pixie Dream Girl and she probably saw him in a similar light. Its never a good thing when you cant tell the person you love the truth about yourself and Nathan never felt comfortable being honest with Annalise, yet he never hesitates to tell Gabriel anything and everything. Oh my god, when Nathan and Gabriel kissed I was so happy. I dont see how Nathan can just keep being like hes my friend well son, I dont typically feel a desire to touch my best friend in a sexual way or make out with them, just putting that out there. And he admitted that he liked it and that he likes Gabriel but then its always but Annalise Im supposed to be with her blegh. Get over it Nathan, Annalise is old news. Gabriel is a beautiful french man who would literally follow you to the ends of the earth who you love and who loves you and who you like kissing! Im not too worried about this though it seems from this interview with Sally Green that things with Nathan and Gabriel are heading in a romantic direction: How did the friendship between Nathan and Gabriel evolve as you were writing? Actually it devolved. In my first draft of Half Bad, the relationship became fully developed early on and they quickly became lovers. But I changed it, to rein it back and leave somewhere for the story to go to. I still like that first draft, though: I felt it was totally real. And although Half Bad is a fantasy story about witches, real is what Im after in the characters and their stories. So I knew Nathan and Gabriels relationship would deepen, but it would take three books rather than thirty pages. Their relationship is a vital part of the trilogy and of the full story of Nathans life. Annalise, Nathans first love, gets him part way along his journey  but Gabriel is his soulmate. Needless to say Im pretty stoked about this. I cant wait to see it all play out. Im also excited to see Nathan embracing and using all of the gifts Marcus passed on to him. I was kind of shocked Marcus died in the second book but I guess it makes sense. He was never really the villain of the series but I do wish we had more time with him. So yea I think Im done ranting. Now it is time to begin the torturous wait for Half Lost!
Really tremendous conclusion to one of my new favorite series. The writing style, amazing plot lines, obvious planning books ahead, beautiful and relatable characters, and just a fun story made this series so fantastic. I dont know how much I can write about this superb giant of a book. I loved all the adventure and though it was a lot to get through, all of the crazy action made it go faster. I think I just mostly liked seeing all my OTPS FINALLY get together and the really heart felt conclusion wrapping everything up. Really all I would like to talk about for my memory would be the characters. First, Jacin and Winter. We have known them the shortest amount of time but I like them as a couple. I was so sad when Jacin had to kill poor Wolf Ryu to save Winter. These two are the most fairy tale out of everyone. While he is not a prince; everything else about them screams Hans Christian Anderson. He devotes himself to always protecting her and shes a little crazy so she needs it. And Winteras I am examining this is pretty much exactly Snow White: shes great with animals, she literally cleaned Mahas house while humming and singing, the Queen wants her dead for being prettier than her, the Queen tricked her into eating an apple candy drugged with the Lunar Letumosis disease, AND her Prince came to take her out of the preservation tankcoffin to save her with the cure. I mean theyre certainly more complex than the original story what with saving Cress, and helping take down the evil Queen but still. I freaked out when Winter finally used her powers to take down Aimery to save Jacin. I knew it was coming but like Jacin I assumed it would make her better; not more crazy. But I really liked how their story wrapped up. Jacin is going to go back to school to be a doctor and see his family more, Winter is going to get Cinders surgery to become sane and help Cinder run Luna. Oh and live happily ever after! There is no safer place for me than at your sidePage 653. Then we haveof course Emperor Kai and Cinderaka Queen Selene. Its the first OTP of the series; and thus holds a special place in our hearts. We waited 3 books for them to get together and it was worth it!! I loved all the cutesy scenes of them together. I also really loved the character development for Cinder. She goes from being super insecure about her Cyborg parts and her Lunar ability to being confident and sad when theyre not there anymore. She had so many battle sequences and she was almost always fighting in a way that would eventually lead her to Kai. He was the beautiful, politically savvy damsel in this tale. I was so angry when Kai actually had to marry Levana; I was so worried she would brain wash him like Evret, but we were good! And there was genuine worry when Cinder got stabbed in the heart and she was dying in his arms. Thank god she mad it though. And that adorable end scene where Kai pretty much proposes to herbut in a nonstupid fairy tale youth way and she symbolically drops her old foot off the mansion cliff. Im going to tell her Ive fallen for one of my captors and the wedding is offPage 92., Of course we have my second favorites as well: Captain Carswell Thorne and Cress!! Each OTP had their own infuriating series difficultiesi.e. Scarlet being kidnapped like always from Wolf, Cinder pushing Kai away because she doesnt want to hurt him, etc. But Thorne and Cress had the typical rom com probables: MISCOMMUNICATION. They love each other like from the get, but problems always stood in their way. She loves him but then sees him with an escort and doubts, and then he loves her but because shes doubtinghe thinks she doesnt love him and by the time She bucks up and is about to tell him she loves him, hes back to being sad and flirty with an escort, and it goes on and on. But we finally got redemption in this one!! That palace scene where he finally admits his feelings made me SO HAPPY. I had to yell and run around the room a bit. There are just so many great scenes involving Thorne andor Cress. Like when Kai turns into the wise old man figure and suddenly starts gigicng Thorne love advice. The Thorne and Cinder never ending humor. OMG when Cress was saved by Jacin and Winter, Thornes reaction was so sad! I just about lost it when Thorne was shot and then the other scene where Cress had to shoot off Thornes fingers to stop him! Man, fingers just do not make it in this series. But their conclusion was just sooooo sweet. Thorne being all nervous and awkward trying to ask Cress to join his crew and how he was going to buy the Rampion and go legit with his adventures. Both of their character arches were so great. Cress becoming more confident and a valued member of the team with her hacking skills and Thorne realizing he can be the hero too and going legit for his love. Just so sweet I love them! One of these days, I just want to open my eyes and see youPage 59. And of course, I saved my personal favorites for last, Scarlet and Wolf!! These two just cannot catch a break. They had the quickest actual gettogether story of all 4 groups but they actually spent the most time apart. Makes me so heated! Of course their beautiful reunion scenesyes, they had multiple because Meyer hates me were the best things ever. I think my favorite scenemaybe of the whole series was when Scarlet meets Wolfs mom, Maha. It was just such a heartfelt and beautiful scene and when Maha diedso did a part of me. They are just the ultimate goal OTP of the series and I just love them. And of course, there conclusion was so cute too. Spending time on the ship with Thorne and Cress and then going back to the farm in France to grow tomatoes. To offer him a life of blue skies and tomatoes and peacePage 363. Side note: loved Ikos moments to shine. Shes really come into her own and I like the idea that she wont be short up all the time in the future. And am I the only one whos saw a little future romance between Iko and Guard Kinney? Do I smell a side novella coming on? And of course the best of all: SPOILER ALERT::::::::::::: QUEEN LEVANA IS DEAD!!! Cinder shot her and it was fabulous and dramatic. I think my favorite scene of the whole book was the end scene with the whole squad having cake with Cinder before her coronation. It was just such a sweet and normal scene for the whole squad to be a part of since they usually never were. I loved it. So lovely and I am so excited for Marrissa Meyers next works. ;D
I want to start off by saying that while I am a fan of Clare and her work I try not to encourage the extreme hype and controversy that surrounds her. However, Lady Midnight deserves all of the praise it gets. Expertly crafted, beautifully written, and surprisingly dark, Clare weaves a magical mystery with family drama and romantic drama seamlessly. Her writing has improved so much its astounding. I have stayed up all night finishing this. More thoughts when Im not half dead! Okay, Ive slept a few more hours and I am ready to begin. Warning, there wont be heavy spoilers but I will be revealing little details about characters so if you dont want to know anything about the book, dont read. It is NOT necessary to read TMI, TID, The Bane Chronicles, and Tales of the Shadowhunter Academy in order to read Lady Midnight but you WILL be spoiled for certain events that happened in these books except for TBC and TotSA. I highly recommend reading them because they are awesome I personally love TID and TotSA the most and because youll understand certain inside jokes in the book. As you can tell from the synopsis, this takes place five years after the events of TMI. Its 2012 and we follow Emma Carstairs and the Blackthorns  Cristina as they try to solve the murders in Los Angeles of both mundanes and fae, and who Emma believes to be behind the murders of her parents. A fae convoy comes and says that in exchange for the LA institutes help they will let Mark choose to either stay with his family or return to the Wild Hunt. Lady Midnight is part detective story, part family drama, with plenty of romance and magic. We meet new characters who I LOVE. Honestly, I love the Blackthorns, Emma, and Cristina. I love their dynamic and how close their family is. They are ruthless. Namely, Julian. Hes had to take care of four kids since he was 12. Yeah, Uncle Arthur is there but theres something about him that is pretty much useless when it comes to the kids. In the wake of their fathers death, Helens exile, and Marks capture by the Hunt, Julian is essentially their father. Emma has been by his side the whole time and shes watched him learn how to take care of young Tavvy, cook, clean, buy groceries, etc. all while easing their nightmares. Hes had to grow up very quickly and there is nothing he wouldnt do to keep his family together, nothing. He wanted to be parabatai with Emma because he was so afraid the Clave would send her away to the Academy, and he needed Emma to stay. Emma is his rock, and its understandable. They are childhood friends who would do anything for each other. And they are certainly NOT a new JaceWill or ClaryTessa. Their personalities are wholly unique and it was great being in the minds of kids who knew who their parents were, have grown up in the Shadowhunter world all their lives, and live in the aftermath of a war. The plot is amazing. You have the overarching plot of solving the murders and finding out whos behind them for Emmas parents and hopefully getting Mark back. Then you have the subplots of Emma and Julians feelings for each other, Kieran  Mark  Cristina  Diego and that whole fiasco, and whether or not Mark will actually choose to stay. Lemme tell you, I was actually suspicious of Diana for quite awhile. She disappears on her own for long periods of time, shes obviously done something illegal, and she holds a lot of secrets. It took me awhile to figure out whos behind everything, and I was pretty sad. It is honestly a pretty heartbreaking story. I think what I love most about the book is how diverse it is. Cristina is Mexican, Diana is black, Mark is bisexual like Helen, and Ty is confirmed by Cassandra to have autism. I wish he could get the professional help he needs. Arthur is obviously mentally ill. Hearing about other shadowhunters who have dyslexia, depression, ADHD etc. and getting hidden away is just so sad. For everything the Clave can do they are not progressive people. They should know that mundanes have medical help for them and should see them as just any other illness that should be treated. I really hope this will be explored more as the trilogy continues, especially with Ty. I do love all of the support he gets from his family, especially from Julian. Marks sexuality isnt really a big thing to him, its just a part of who he is and Im so glad because thats how it should be. Honestly, I love how Clare was so influenced by Annabel Lee took Poes poem and turned it into a shadowhunter thing. The English Lit nerd part of me who loves Poe realized the chapter titles were lines from Annabel Lee and I got so happy. Clare weaves the poem into the plot so well, its amazing. I also loved how Clare hinted that Poe somehow found out about Malcolm and Annabels story and thats who the poem is based off of. SHIPPING MARK AND CRISTINA SO HARD. I just love how Cristina grounds Mark, especially in the beginning when he was readjusting to the human world and being around his family. I dunno, I just have such a soft spot for Mark. Hes been through so much, and I just want him to be happy. Diego is a dummy and can go away because honestly if he really loved Cristina he would have defended her to Jaime. Also, his brother Jaime sounds like a sociopath if he really has no compassion and empathy in his heart. Im really hoping everyone works their love lives out. Emma and Julian need to be saved somehow and Mark and Cristina need to be together. The whole parabatai problem is obviously very worrisome, and Im hoping there will be SOMETHING to make this all work out in two books. As for Kit, I knew there was something about him that had to be important since he has a POV. Once he started doing cool moves I was like okay this kid is the lost Herondale. And then Jem and Tessa come in and are awesome together. I really think Kit and Ty will be a thing because remember, far in the future Clare said The Wicked Powers will be about two gay shadowhunters in love and I have a feeling it will be about them. There is a big emphasis on family in this, and I love it. Exploring Julian and Marks relationship, their roles have essentially reversed. When Mark was taken, he was the older one in charge who knew how to take care of the kids. Now, his time in Faerie has made him forget how to care for them and be stern with them, thats Julians role now. You can see they really love each other, but Julian gets frustrated by Mark and how hes not how he expected him to be which is sad. That whipping scene! Oh man, broke my heart. I sobbed. And then with that last chapter things will clearly not get better. Oh Mark, you just had to say it. And Emma may just go through with it because its not like she can explain why she wants a pretend boyfriend and ughh this is not gonna go well. Everyone has such unique personalities, but they all work together so well. Things I want exploredanswered: More knowledge on the parabatai thing, MORE JEM AND TESSA we barely saw them and I was hoping they would be more involved with Emma and co., Dianas secrets, Cristinas history and past with Diego and Jaime, mental illness among shadowhunters, Kit and his perhaps budding friendship with Ty, how Livvy will feel about this, and the aftermath of that Why lie? and epilogue. I just knew that epilogue was gonna happen, I knew it! Also, I refuse to believe Malcolm is dead until I see the body. Honestly, I think what you realize the most above all is that for the Blackthorns and Emma, family is everything. Oh, one more thing! THAT SPECIAL STORY AT THE END. SIMON AND IZZY ARE ENGAGED!!!! MY BABIES ARE OKAY!!!!! JACE PROPOSED TO CLARY BUT WE DONT KNOW IF SHE WILL SAY YES!!! Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Clares writing is spectacular and the characters are amazing. I still love TID the most, but who knows I may change my mind yet. Damn this is a long review... so sorry guys lol. Oh I almost forgot. Mark, youre a book boyfriend.
Joint review with Sophia originally posted at  Summary Remington is a boxer who fights in an underground fighting circuit. Hes working toward winning another championship. He spots Brooke in the crowd at one of his fights and is immediately taken with her. So much so, he knocks out his opponent and leaves the ring to introduce himself when he notices she has left her seat in the crowd. The encounter is brief but intense. Brooke is a former Olympic hopeful whose career was ended by a severe injury during Olympic tryouts. Shes recently graduated and looking for employment as a sports rehab specialist. Shes taken by surprise when she receives an invitation and four tickets to Remys next fight which she accepts. When she is invited to Remys hotel room she assumes its because Remy wants to be with her. Shes quite surprised when she is offered a job on Remys team for the remainder of his tour. When she is pressure by Remy to accept, she does and goes on the road into the world of underground fighting. Remington Sophia: The words fallen boxer in the blurb grabbed my attention and made me want to read this book. I expected a tough alpha male and a good amount of angst. We get that from Remington, but unfortunately for the first half of the book we just dont get much more. The story is told from Brookes point of view and from that perspective, Remington comes off as a single minded fighting machine who doesnt speak much and sort of grunts and growls to get what he wants. We dont get to know much about him until the last half of the book. His alpha behavior is pretty sexyknocking a guy out so he can rush to meet a girl he spotted in the crowdbut I wanted more than that. I wish we would have had Remys perspective, or at least more dialogue from him so as to get to know him better early on. Later we learn more about his past, who he is, and about his problems, but it didnt come soon enough for me. Angela: Yes, the blurb caught my eye, but also the sexy goodness that is the cover for REAL. I think Ive mentioned on more than one occasion that I am a little bit of a cover slut. Remington is very alpha, and for some reason he wants Brooke from the first moment he sees her. Enough to knock out his opponent and chase after her in the crowd. I have to admit that first scene had me stoked for the rest of the book: His lips curl and he meets my gaze. Brooke Dumas. He just fucked my name right in front of me. Unfortunately, it takes a very long time to actually get to know Remington. He remains a man of very little words throughout most of the first half of the book. He fights, he trains, he has eye foreplay with Brooke, he has more eye foreplay with Brooke and he acts all mysterious and possessive. There was a bit of foreshadowing of what Remys issues actually were, but I still wanted more of him. Im all for a sexy, misunderstood bad boy, but I think this story would have worked better if we could have had a scene here and there from his POV, instead of Brookes endless stream of internal monologue about how much she wanted his body. The issues he was dealing with are serious, and they made him unpredictable in his actions and feelings. While I think I understand what the author was trying to do with making the story come all from Brookes POV and have a mystery surrounding Remy and his problems, I dont think she fully fleshed out his character or allowed he and Brooke to have an authentic romance. The chemistry between them and their lust for each other was so prevalent that it almost made their emotional attachment seem superficial. Brooke Sophia: I had mixed feelings about Brooke. I liked that she seized the moment and accepted the job offered by Remy. It was her dream job and I thought it was cool she followed her dream. However, I didnt like that gave into pressure from Remy to accept the job immediately. She doesnt know this guy yet she allows him to bully her. I felt like she established a precedent for their relationship, both professional and personal by allowing him to steamroll her. Later Brooke becomes annoying. Theres just no other way to say it. She doesnt know if Remy wants her and is confused about his actions toward her. She wonders is she too fat, shes very fit, works out, eats right etc. Admittedly, he throws off some weird signals but he wants her. Her insecurities and inability to initiate communication made her seem immature and it was frustrating. She also makes a dumb decision regarding her sister and Remys enemy. Its inevitable it will all blow up her face and I was frustrated by her and the predictability of the outcome. Angela: I saw the thing with Remys enemy and what happens after coming from a mile away. I just KNEW that was what the outcome was going to be. And this is the very reason Brooke got on my nerves the last half of the book. She seemed like she might have some tough girl appeal at the beginning, but I agree with you, as soon as she bows down to Remys pressure she sets their relationship up for the rest of the book. I think what most bothered me the most though was how she gets Remy to finally give in and have sex with her, tells him she accepts him knowing his mental battles and then creates a clusterfuck mess with her stupid decisions. Then leaves at the first sign of trouble. I wanted to throat punch her. Especially when and the way she left. Not cool. The long buildup and the sex... Angela: There was this point at about 40 in that I was just tired of the foreplay and buildup. I wanted them to get it on and get it over with. I did. There was so much angsty intense stare downs, mouth nookie and diamond hard nipples that I just wanted to see if the sex could live up to the build up. It did and it didnt. It was hot and seriously sexy, but it sure did have a lot to live up to after that much build up. Sophia: I agree. I dont necessarily need the sexy times immediately, but with all that foreplay, it was just too much. Everything that happened up until they actually had sex was foreplay. Watching Remy fight, stretching Remy out, everything. Final Thoughts: Angela: I know from my review that it sounds like I didnt enjoy REAL at all. I did. I really did. There were parts that irritated me, characters I wanted to understand better and things I wished would have been explained a little more, but all in all I enjoyed it. REAL is this authors debut and I will definitely be giving her a try again. Final Grade: C Sophia: Same. It seems like I had a lot to complain about but I never felt like I wanted to toss the book. I wanted to keep going. I was frustrated because I didnt get to know the hero well enough to be swoon worthy and that is what I really wanted from the beginning. I did like the end and what Remy eventually does for Brooke. Its very emotional, and it made a pretty good ending. I wish Brooke would have made better decisions. But, I liked that she loved her man and she stood by him, even in the face of his very serious problems. I was entertained, just not wowd. Final Grade: C Favorite Quotes: Sophia: Feel better? he murmurs, raising his dark brows, and I cant believe how his voice affects me, how his touch affects me, his scent, how another human can have such power over me. I cant let it. I. Cant. Let it. Angela: I love everything about him. Brooke Dumas, he murmurs, licking into my ear, his eyes sparkling. Im Remington. I laugh, then moan and dissolve into him. Seriously, hes so fucking sexy I cant stand it.
I dont know where to begin. I have waited so many years for this book. And it was everything I wanted it to be and more. Im just sad that it is over. Sniffs. But, there will be Stars Above. And it will have short stories. And an epilogue. And I am dying for it to come out. Eeek. I need this epilogue. So excited for it. Winter is so long. Over eight hundred pages. The pages are thin and the book is heavy. I love it. It looks so stunning. It took me a while to read this precious, but I dont mind. I love how long it was. I even wish it was even longer. Because it was perfection. It was everything I wanted. And it was heartbreaking. So good. How do I even talk about this book without mentioning all the spoilers.. Ahh. I am not sure. But I shall try my best. Some things you probably knows already that would happen, so I dont count that as spoiling things. I shall just talk a bit about all the things that I loved about this precious book. Which is a lot. Because this book was perfect from the very first page until the end. I loved it so, so much. Best book. Im so happy with how good this series have been. How perfect these books are. And how much I love them all. Ack. Marissa Meyer is my favorite author. I adore her the most. And I cannot wait to read even more amazing books by her. I cant describe how much I love these books. I do think these books are my favorite series. Sigh. There is so much happening in this book. The plot is all kinds of amazing. And so much happens. And ahh. I was so nervous at all times. Because everything goes wrong with all the plans. And it was so heartbreaking to read about. Yet so amazing too, because I loved it as well. Most of this book takes place on Luna. With Cinder trying to get rid of Levana, trying to get the people to support her. It is a lot of work. And it was so interesting to read about. I loved getting to see Luna more. It seemed awesome. I have lived in fear of her my entire life, she continued. If this is the only chance Im given to stand against her, then I have to take it. I dont want to hide. I dont want to be afraid. And I dont want to be separated from you, ever again. I love how this book is told from a lot of different point of views. It is never once annoying. And I loved all the different voices. These characters are amazing. Getting to know Winter more was so great. She is incredible. Yet so broken too, because she does not use her Lunar gifts. So shes a bit crazy. Well, a lot of crazy. But shes still herself. And she is adorable. And I loved her so much. And I just wanted the very best for her. Ack. So much heartbreak. Anyway. I adored Winter. And every single thing about her. There was also a love interest for Winter. The very awesome Jacin. Whom we have sort of seen in all the books. Sometimes he annoyed me a little bit. But he was all kinds of swoony too. I loved how much he cared for Winter. How much he wanted to protect her. How complicated their relationship was. It was stunning to read about. They are way too adorable together. Ack. So cute. The relationship between Winter and Levana is not good. And it was so interesting to read about. Shudders. It was scary too. There is a lot of stunning relationships in this book. A lot of amazing friendships. And I loved reading about them all so much. I love how close these characters have gotten. Sniffs. And then there are all the different romances. And oh my. Those are perfection. And stunning. And swoony. And I cannot. Marissa wrote them all so well. I loved every moment. Every stolen kiss. I still ship Cinder and Kai the most. But I adore everyone. So much. Winter and Jacin are all kinds of adorable. I loved reading about them both. Jacin, she said, with a shaky smile. You must know. I cannot remember a time when I didnt love you. I dont think such a time ever existed. I cannot tell you how much I adore all the characters in this book. Cinder and Kai are my favorites. Because they are both all kinds of amazing. I cannot explain it better than that. I just adore them the most. But I also love Scarlet and Wolf to pieces too. So much bad happens with them in this book. I cannot. Heartbreak. It wasnt fair to Wolf. And it still hurts me. Yet it was so perfect and horrifying and I loved every moment. Despite my broken heart. Wolfs story is incredible. I loved reading it the most. But I also love Thorne and Cress to pieces as well. I ship them so hard. And reading about them together is so much fun, as there is a little bit of drama there too. Loved it. They are just so cute. I loved how much Cress grew in this book. Shes much more brave and awesome. I just. I adored every single character in this book. And I just dont want their stories to be over. Sniffs. I want more. I need more. The ending is amazing. And thats all I will say about it. But I want more, lol. I will always want more. Im so happy with how much I adored this final book. I havent been able to say much in this review of mine. Because Im a bit speechless with how much I adored this book. Which was a lot. The book is so long. Yet I dont have much to say. Most is spoilery, lol. I just. I loved every thing about this book. I loved how much fighting there was. I was heartbroken about some deaths. I loved how everything ended. Yet I still cannot fully believe that this story is done with. Now just dying for Stars Above to come in February. I shall not say much more. I loved Winter the very most. The characters are the best. The writing is perfection. The story is heartbreaking and exciting and I loved every moment. I couldnt have asked for more in this final book. Winter was everything that I wanted it to be. The most perfect final book to a series. Also the most heartbreaking one, in a way. I loved it. So much. You must all read this book, right away. You will not regret it. I cannot wait to read this book again and again. Which I know I will do a lot.  This review was first posted on my blog, Carinas Books, here: 
Confusing at times, but beautiful nevertheless. This is one of those books that you need to read half way through in order to enjoy the other half.. And so I did  enjoyed and loved it. From the beginning there was something eerie about the action, the characters, all their secrets, the magic binding them all and the prophecies that threatened to tear them apart. Off course, it took time for the world building to sink in, for the characters to get to my heart, for the action to glue me to my chair with this book in my hand and to make me want to never let it go. You are cruel, dear Maggie, you made me love this book so much just before the ending came and took away some very close to my heart characters. How could you? How will I wait for the next book now? The pack of characters: 1. Blue is our notsoplain Jane  the girl who doesnt fit anywhere, too normal in her own home, but too weird in the eyes of the others. I liked her easy friendship with Gansey, her cute relationship with her mother and relatives, the blush on her cheeks when she talked with Adam and the stubbornness to help her raven boys. I still wonder about the prophecy about Blues first love, her first kiss, the boy that might die because of her... there are many things that still need to be revealed and I cant wait for that to happen. 2. Gansey is as we find out from the beginning either Blues true love, or he will be killed by her. Truth being told, I rooted for Gansey with his way of wanting to help everyone. Maybe helping with your money is not the right way, maybe using your power, your name is not the only way.. but he cared for his friends and it hurt when the others didnt see how much he just wanted to be there for them, to make things easier for them, to even buy their happiness if that was what it would take.. Also he had a borrowed life, one that he didnt ask for, but it gave him a purpose and it made him maybe a better version of himself. 3. Adam is my favorite raven boy. Am I allowed to have a favorite? I think I do and I cared so much for Adam, for his need to be his own property, for his hope that things could get better, for just wanting not to owe anything to anyone, for being so sincere and for making me smile with his shy love for a girl that might or might not be .. too young?. There were some things he said that made Blue blush just a bit and me giggle a bit more, because there is something sweet about a boy loving a girl and not knowing how to put into words what he feels. Knowing Adam was like holding a glass figurine  all smooth lines, but so damn easily breakable. He was a bit too proud to let people help him, but I was glad that his friendship with Roman made him make the right choice. 4. Ronan is the troubled one. Oh how I resented Ronan at the beginning, I am not even sure why. Half the book I didnt even like him, but them all changed and I am not even sure at what point. I have a gazillion questions about him, his family, his tattoo, his little bird.. But all I need to remember is how he showed Gansey how to through a punch and how he defended his friend, Adam when he most needed it, and how he cared for Noah.. and I could go on and on, but Ill just stop. 5. And then there was Noah.. Oh, poor boy, Noah, he told us his truth but we didnt have the ears to listen. I must confess that I kind of ignored him. He was there in the background and I never looked his way until I realized that he was standing right in my way. He was there, never really being, and that seems quite ironic at this point. The plot: Oh my! Yes, the first half was all about character and world building and it was slow. Its not like there was nothing interesting happening, but at the beginning everything was so confusing. There were tons of characters with different personalities and stories of their own and it was hard to focus on each one of them and remember all the details. There was so much mystery that I couldnt get my head around.. but then the light came and everything was so much easier to enjoy. After Blue joined the raven boys determined to solve the mystery and help Gansey, all pieces started to fit perfectly and that was the moment I realised how much I was enjoying this story. I loved the past and the present, the timeless wood and the magic surrounding Henrietta and our beloved characters. I loved the search for the lye lines and the sleeping king Glendower; and I loved all the secondary characters and their part in the play. I loved all the clues left behind and how everything fit into the story, I loved all the questions we had and how they havent been answered such that we will need to find out more. And I loved the tiny romantic side of the story  it didnt take my attention from what was important, but it was just enough to make me smile. 4.5 stars, so why not 5? I had one tiny problem with the writing style. I am not sure if I can explain it, but it got to be a bit confusing: You see, I usually love 3rd person narration, but the way it switched points of view in this particular story left some room for confusion  maybe you had no problems at all, but sometimes I didnt know if the narrator was thinking some things OR the characters were. depending on my mood you will probably see 4 or 5 stars here on GR Talking about GoodReads: Dont trust the synopsis from here. Whats that: Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she cant entirely explain? Did someone mistake this book for Twilight or what? Because this describes half the paranormal stories out there, but it also happens to be so very wrong when it cames to this story. If you ask me, the last time I checked Blue was drawn to someone else , and she could explain it quite very well.. Just saying. Anyways, this was indeed a great book, which I liked very much. It is full of magic and intrigue and it can only make you want to read the next one really, really badly. So keep an eye on it and read it if you get the chance  Happy midnight dreaming!

I have never ever EVER cried as much as I did reading anything as I did reading this book. Or watching anything, honestly. This is the most surprising thing considering how many tears Ive shed readingwatching sad stories. Im exhausted. Emotionally drained. Im not even sure what to say except I wanted some sort of record at the end, one last status update, to say that Ive finished it. I cant even look at my garbage bin at all the used tissues. This is all beyond embarrassing. This is going to be one messy review because Im typing all this in one go, minutes after reading it. Its going to be nice to read this at a later time when I think about this book and have a chuckle. Even halfway through I was thinking I couldnt, in all honesty, recommend this to anyone, because it was so difficult to read. I just cant imagine anyone being prepared to read whats between all these pages. The abuse comes in many forms  Im not sure how to else to describe it but I found it to be much worse than I had expected going in, and I did go into this with some warning here and there, thinking I knew what I was getting to but really had no idea. Yanagiharas prose works in a way that I wouldnt describe it as being graphic but there is no way you can be oblivious to whats happening. Dont expect anything to be shied away from. I dont think my reviews are really read much but Id feel terrible if I didnt include this warning in here, nonetheless. Its a lot to take in. I actually cheated a few times and skimmed a bit ahead because I I needed to get past this scene and that scene and know that things would be okay, and eventually Id go back and read it at a normal pace, while knowing that I was being ridiculous. Ive never had to resist doing that as much as I did for this book. I cant even remember the last time Ive had to push myself going forward because I didnt want to read anymore. I got so attached to all these characters that I shocked myself. I wanted Jude to be all right, as all right as it could be for Jude, and for his friends to love him, and for him to understand that, for everyone to find successes but most of all stay together, and see each other every once in a while despite them having more obligations in their lives, for them to find happiness, all the happiness that they all deserved, for Malcolm to find that spark again and to be confident in his talents, for Willem, dear sweet Willem, to get more roles and become a star, for Andy to be there for Jude  forever his combative and lovable self  but to be a wonderful husband and father as well, to Harold and Julia to vacation forever at Truro and invite everyone, for JBs art to finally be discovered, and so on and so on and so on... I usually lack the patience to read books that promise decades of story, of following characters that the readers are supposed to dedicate all this time to get to know and to care about what happens in their lives as they get older, to see them experience joy and incredible loss, so Ive skipped them. Some inexplicable sense of curiosity made me pick this up and I was hooked from the start. On the very first page, Jude and Willem are looking at an apartment. Its nothing out of ordinary, certainly, for two friends. They speak their first lines and then, smile at each other. Theres an understanding. And a tenderness. This was it. This simple scene made me feel like I understood what these two had, and I wanted to meet the rest of their group to see how the puzzle fitted together. It didnt feel like the beginning of a story. It felt established. And indeed their relationship was, for they already had the experience of living together with the other two as a group during college, and this was only the extension of that. And its for these small moments of kindness and friendship that kept me reading and rooting for all these characters to keep going on. I cant explain why I was so touched by that first smile that was mentioned there, but it was hard to ignore, just like all the other smiles for the rest of it. I needed to keep going to know that they would keep happening, as silly as it was. There really is no way for me to nicely sum up this book. Im not sure if Id ever reread it, if I ever could reread it. I might want to view my favourite passages again, but beyond that I doubt it. For all of the incredible writing, there is so much of it thats disturbing that I wouldnt feel comfortable enough giving my usual hearty rec. That said, I dont regret reading this at all. As much as I was horrified by what I was reading, most of my tears were shed for the happiest of moments, where joy seemed to be bursting out from the words itself, and I just wanted to cry and cry from being so overwhelmed. How amazing it is to write something that can induce such a visceral response. How amazing it is for me to be able to experience that as a reader. And that is why, having invested tears and laughter and everything in between, I wont ever forget about this book. PS: Im not sure how often this is being mentioned but I really do appreciate the racial diversity in the four friends. Its sad that I just assume the default with their backgrounds but I was so pleasantly surprised. Its a lot more realistic and its always important to note when theres representation. And sexuality not being treated as strict borders that everyone follows in between the lines? That was appreciated as well. The story wouldve gripped me just as much but I loved that Hanya Yanagihara was making the conscious choice to include all of the above. And because of that, I wouldve loved even more on Malcolm and JB as well, to check in on them more as they changed and matured or not over the years, on top of everything else. I cared tons about the four of them even if my heart had a special spot for Jude. But my god, did I ever love Andy.
From  6 effing stars. At A Glance I. Die. You know the dreaded question: If you were stranded on a deserted island and you can only bring five books with you, which ones would you bring? Most readers would panic because the idea of only 5 books is sickening, but it seems that question is not so hard for me anymore. Because, hands down, The Sea of Tranquility would be one of those five books, and I would enjoy it again and again for years on end. Thats why I had to give it my rare 6 stars. The Good I had to wait some time to write this review after reading this book because I needed time to let the awesomeness soak in. If I hadnt, I would be a rambling mess of emotions. Even now, I dont know what to say. How can I describe the perfection of this book? Maybe its not perfect for everyone but I can guarantee that most of us readers will fall madly in love with The Sea of Tranquility. Right now this book has almost 14,000 ratings on Goodreads and is averaging a 4.56 star rating. Thats pretty damn amazing. Let me start off by saying that this is not a perfect romance. This book is more about two troubled souls, who have horrible pasts of lose, who find kinship with each other. Its a slow build and its so worth the wait. Nastya and Josh remind me of the peanut butter and jelly in a PBJ sandwich yes, thats what I had for lunch today. They couldnt be more opposite in their structure, in their overall essence, but together they meld and blend into rightness. It just takes that one time for them to come together and you know from then on they should never be separated. And then you see how similar they really are. And let me also mention that this book may seem slow in the beginning, but believe me, it needs to be that way. You cant jump into something like this without having your heart be ripped into shreds. You have to be eased in. This book packs so much emotion that I still feel raw weeks after reading it. The writing is not just words and sentences. Its art incarnate. I dont know if I have read a better written book in all my life. The dialogue is both witty and soulful. The pacing is perfect for this kind of book. The characters inner thoughts broke me, then healed me, then broke me again. I was an open wound for a couple days while reading this book, and I loved every minute of it. I think my bottom lip even quivered from time to time as I forced myself to hold back the tears. This is definitely a character driven novel. Millay goes above and beyond when making Nastya and Josh into real people. I never once thought that I was reading a book. I felt like Nastya and Josh were recounting their lives up close and personal. Even the side characters like Drew became real to me. I know these characters more than I know any family member, best friend, or even myself. I dont think anything with a beating heart could not feel bad for Nastya. She went through a heartbreaking and tragic experience that no one should have to endure. And because of this event, she has stopped speaking, to anyone. Being mute can make it hard when you go to high school, but when you dress like a Russian hooker on purpose, its apparent no amount of teasing or bullying will ever affect you. Nastya is the living, breathing version of the doorknob sigh reading Do Not Disturb. Everything she does is to keep people away. After losing a piece of her soul, she wants nothing to do with the world. But then she meets Josh. And for the first time in a long time shes interested...interested in interacting and living. Nastya is troubled and emotionally fragile but she is also a very strong person. She has to be with what shes gone through. Shes bright and talented, even if she doesnt think so anymore. But what she needs is to heal. And even Josh may not be able to do the job, because sometimes we have to heal ourselves first. Josh has lost everyone some way or another. And when everyone close to you seems to die, you kind of become a social void. The high school kids are a little afraid of Josh and he likes it that way. Hed rather be left alone. Then the mute and exotic Nastya comes into town stirring controversy and Josh cant help but notice. But its not until Nastya starts forcing herself into his daily routines that Josh starts to see the girl no one else sees. He sees someone emotionally damaged but beautiful nonetheless. Shes unique and mysterious and Josh wants to solve the mystery of her past but he lets Nastya reveal things on her own time. He gives her the space she needs and offers her security in his house and his garage where they work on his woodworking together. Josh is quiet and understanding, which is exactly what Nastya needed. The Sea of Tranquility was powerful, deep, and beautiful. It has everything a reader can hope for in a book. The plot was well thought out and executed amazingly. And the mystery behind Nastya was handled so well I still feel tense from the suspense. Ugh, I wish I was a better writer because I still dont think I even skimmed the surface of what this book is like or how it made me feel. Its indescribable. I have to mention how perfect that ending was. I was a little nervous it was going to be a sad ending but no, it wrapped up everything very well and even has the best last sentence ever in the world. My heart broke into happy little pieces then formed back together stronger than before when I read the last page. The Bad How dare anyone suggest something is bad about this book!!! : The Snuggly Mercy! Nastya and Josh have the most complicated, messed up relationship. They start out ignoring each other, then become awkward friends, then you think there can be more after a special night, then Nastya ruins it all, then Josh makes it worse. You will want to yell and scream when it comes to these two. They are both emotionally stunted and how they even became friends is beyond me. But you will also love them to the little red recesses of your heart because no two people deserve to be happy more than these two. We get a sex scene that isnt graphic. Its appropriate for YA readers. However, there is a sexual assault scene. So be prepared. Final Thoughts Remember, this is not a full blown romance type of book. The romance and relationship building takes forever, but its perfect for this book. You just have to give it time. This is a character driven book with a lot of tragic elements but has inspiring moments in it that makes it so worth all the heartbreak. VERY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Quotes People like to say love is unconditional, but its not, and even if it was unconditional, its still never free. Theres always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they wont be happy unless you are ... I just dont want that responsibility. I wished my mother was here tonight, which is stupid, because its an impossible wish. He shrugs and turns to me, drowning the smile that cracks me every time. Its not stupid to want to see her again. It wasnt so much that I wanted to see her again, he says, looking at me with the depth of more than seventeen years in his eyes. I wanted her to see you. There are so many things that can break you if theres nothing to hold you together. Were like mysteries to one another. Maybe if I can solve him and he can solve me, we can explain each other. Maybe thats what I need. Someone to explain me. People who go around advertising their birthdays are douchebags. Its a fact. You can look it up on Wikipedia.

The bestseller and awarded the GOODREADS CHOICE 2014 WINNER and which is said to have done well at the box office since October 02, 2015 is indeed WORTH READING. I repeat it is WORTH READING. If you have not read it yet and have been curious about why it is such a big talk in the Goodreads universe, I would like you to bear in mind first some reminders before you prep it but not necessarily that you take them; I know you would still give it a try at any cost out of idle curiosity. You should be ready that reading it requires a paucity of MATH and other branches of science such as CHEMISTRY, ASTRONOMY, ENGINEERING, PHYSICS , BOTANY, to name a few unless you majored in one of them. Otherwise, you might end up in a moment of epistaxis and cerebral hemorrhage. In other words, the novel is strewn with technical words. Therefore, make sure that you have internet connection at your disposal to Google some words beyond your imagination. In doing so can help you understand the story more clearly. The concept of the story is very new to me, for it may be my second SciFi. The last one was the CONTACT by Carl Sagan. I had enjoyed it at first since I was not completely familiar with all stuff in the universe. However, I lost my interest in its book cover edition; I was very choosy then. Uhoh! Beggars cannot be choosers. Then, I could no longer get around to it. An astronaut is stranded on Mars when it just happens that he is not able to leave it with his other crews in the midst of the sandstorm. In order to survive the red planet, he will use his vast knowledge of Botany and Engineering as well as his wide training and experience in Astronomy. Each day is perilous for Mark as if he walks with a tight rope. Admittedly, I was close to demoting it to 3 stars  Not that bad. I still liked it  for the three reasons: 1. I did not like the writing style, let alone its prose. It is brusque in context despite the fact that it is pregnant with jargon.  But I know there is nothing wrong with brusque language ; it could still be an art. Probably, it is not my cup of tea. I am more used to classic writings just the like of awardwinning writers. You know what I meant to say.  Nevertheless, in the end, I realized that Andy Weirs intention is to voice what a devastating life of an astronaut stuck on such barren and dreary planet is like .  If I am not mistaken! 2.  Although I enjoyed the parts in the beginning, of how Mark Wanty sorts his dilemma out, the longer he describes his some problems , the more I find them a pain in the ass. In short, they were taxing me too. 3. The plot of the story is banal and typical of other thereshouldbeontherescuescenes science fictions. On the other hand, I cant forbear from lavishing praise on it: 1. Indeed, it is spellbinding. Every page is so enthralling that I could no longer recognize the people around me, that I was not aware of them, of my environment at all. laughs 2. I liked its ending. It does not need to show that Mark Wanty will have a tearjerking heros welcome as soon as he is back on Earth. The last breathtaking scene of how he gets aboard and his final journal are enough to bring a thousand words. Weir might have been aware that readers are already familiar with that schematic denouement. 3. I learned a whole lot about science. In fact, I feel like studying Astronomy. blushing I am now very interested in studying the heavenly bodies. All the things about Cosmo, NASA, space exploration, thingamabob. Wow! What an interesting field! 4. The theme is very purely scientific. It focuses just on Mars probe. As far as we know, Mars has been the favorite hobbyhorse among scientists in the hypothesis that whether there is a high chance to live on this planet or not. 5. It is very scientifically detailed. Obviously, Andy Weir researched about Mars and NASA thoroughly, especially the problems on Mars Mark Wanty has to sort out such as on how to produce water and oxygen , plant , repair the machines , blah blah blah . Wow, I was impressed. Kudos to him!  6. Despite its typically thereshouldbeontherescuescenes story, the epistolary writing riddled with technical words did the justice. So, I cant say that there is nothing new to it. Rather, I highly recommend it to everyone, notably to students who have been taught the Creationism. Upon reading it, I would like to conclude that: a. The book AWKWARDLY suggests that China has a hidden ambition to compete with the USA in the field of space exploration. The good thing is that China has not given Andy Weir a brunt of criticism nor even declared him persona non grata yet. Perhaps Weir also suggests that China has the capacity to keep up with the modern technology despite the worlds stereotype about madeinChina products. b. The book suggests the perpetual debate among theists and atheists whether God exists or not. c. The book suggests that sometimes NASA or science itself has limitations; scientific analyses could be invalid, but nothing is impossible. d. The book suggests that we, the world, at any cost, is raring to spend billions of dollars on space exploration. Paradoxically, there is a widespread famine in some parts of the world. e. The book suggests that we could be optimistic in a dire situation.  I doubt it.  Probably yes, since we have the survival instinct. But gee, if I were Mark Watney, probably no! since I am not that as genius as he is. laughs f. The book suggests that we should use our common sense as well as need to be knowledgeable about science at all times if the need rises. g. The book suggests that a human being has a basic instinct to help one another out as what Mark Watney exemplifies at the end of the book : If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that its found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just dont care, but theyre ,massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of that, I had billions of people on my side. Well, no doubt it has received positive feedback, so the British magazine site ,The Guardian , should put it on the new pedestal of 1001 Best Novels of All Time. Since I am done with it, I am all systems go for its movie adaptation, especially the actor who leads the role of Mark Watney is one of my favorite Hollywood actors, Matt Damon. 13 13 13 
Lets just start off by saying that as a person with desi descent, its so freaking refreshing to read a book and find yourself within the characters. When Dimple Met Rishi stars two main characters, Dimple and Rishi, both with Indian heritage and going off to university in the fall. Dimple yearns to take part in a summer program before the school year starts, and her parents, with surprisingly no hesitation, let her go. It is there where she is suddenly approached by a boy named Rishi, claiming that hes here to meet her due to their suggested arranged marriage by their parents. Dimple, with absolutely no idea about the arrangement, freaks out, and the story starts off from there. When Dimple Met Rishi was easily one of the most humorous books Ive ever read. I loved the banter, the hilarious encounters these two went through, and the cultural references in this book. I just gotta say, when youre reading a book and there are some lines in another language, and just references from another culture, AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND AND RELATE TO THESE LINES AND REFERENCES BECAUSE ITS APART OF YOUR CULTURE?????? ITS A FUCKING PHENOMENAL FEELING. So thank you for Sandhya Menon for this absolutely wonderful representation. Its sad that this the first book Ive ever read where I felt represented culturally. Representation should not be RARE in literature, and its honestly a really sad thought. One of my favorite conversations in the book was: Really? Have you ever been to a party? Like, in high school? Sure I have. Dimple raised an eyebrow. Like, a legit party. One a parent didnt organize. There was silence. She laughed. You were thinking of Diwali parties, werent you? RELATABLE. RELATABLE AF. I LITERALLY AM RISHI. I HAVE ONLY EVER BEEN TO LIKE CULTURALFAMILY PARTIES. NEVER EVEN TO A HIGH SCHOOL ONE. LITERALLY SAMEEEEEEE. Representation aside, which what I personally felt was the best part of the book, this novel was a really quick and sweet romantic contemporary. The romance was a little too cheesy for my taste, and the plot itself was pretty cliche and predictable, but I still had fun while I was reading. There were some lines that were just waaaaay to cringey  instalovey for me to handle though. Weve got: Holy hotness, Batman. literally, what? Dimple yelled, her voice crashing into him, reaching into his chest, and pulverizing his heart. Its lines like these that make me wonder why I would ever willingly pick up a contemporary book Because, Dimple Shah, I am stupidly, idiotically, annoyingly in love with you. Ive heard this line so many times that I didnt think it was possible for it to be LEGALLY printed again Was she really going to do this? When just looking at him made her feel like this? This rush of love and companionship and friendship and happiness? Was she just going to extinguish it all because of timing? But she knew the answer. Yes, she would. Yes, because this was not the plan. Yes, because the last thing she wanted was to break it off five years down the road, when the two of them would be in so much deeper, itd be like cutting off a limb. It would be painful now, but nothing compared to what it could be like. So the answer was yes. YALL LITERALLY MET FOR ONLY THREE WEEKS. SIT THE FUCK DOWNNNNNNN So yeah. Now, onto other problems with this book. Besides the predictability of the plot and the instalovey romance, there were still a few things that stuck out to me. It was mostly all regarding Dimple. She was SO ANNOYING the entirety of this book. In the beginning of the book, shes literally complaining about how she wants to focus on her studies and doesnt have time to wear makeup or dresses or contacts, like her mom wants her to wear. And hey, if thats her, then GOOD FOR HER. But fast forward about a month later and Dimple is suddenly super interested in changing her look. She looked like a girl in a magazine, someone who should pose beside a vintage bike with pastelcolored flowers and balloons. She belonged on a greeting card. Like girl, you literally just put on a dress... pipe the fuck down. This wouldnt have bothered me at all if she had just wanted to do this out of her own interest, but the fact that she did this because of advice from Celia on changing her look to impress Rishi... I mean. Just. Really. All throughout the book, the audience is introduced to the Aberzombies, a bunch of rich teenagers portrayed as idiots and snobs. Yet, I felt like there was this awful portrayal that all rich people not including Rishi, were exactly like that. They were just dumb rich kids who knew nothing about anything. She knew that. And yet, somehow, it was amazing how conversations like these made her feel so other. Dumb and rich. They were dynamicless characters with absolutely no personality traits; their sole purpose in this novel was to act as an annoyance towards Dimple. I mean, come on. Really. Another rich character in this novel, Isabelle, honestly does nothing to Dimple but try to be nice to her. Still, Dimple has rude preconceived thoughts about her just because shes rich and hangs out with the Aberzombies: Chill, she mumbled. Shes just interested in a connection with someone from her own country. Dimple tried not to roll her eyes at Isabelles wellintentioned defense. Really, it was sort of refreshing to have a boy prefer her company to a girl like Isabelles. That literally had never happened before. Of course Isabelle was up for it. Shed probably even eat carbs for that amount of attention. Dimple ignored the pinprick of guilt she felt at the uncharitable thought; Isabelle wasnt nearly as awful as the guys. Like seriously. Youve got no reason to attack this girl other than the fact that shes rich. Shes done no harm to you, and never meant to offend you in any way, so stop acting like a fucking bitch, Dimple. But all in all, yup. These were my thoughts on When Dimple Met Rishi. I was really happy about the diversity and cultural representation in this book, which pretty much made up for a lot of the things I still found problematic in the novel. If it wasnt for the interesting cultural aspect, I feel like that I wouldve automatically bumped this novel down to a 3 stars. Besides the rich culture, I kinda found everything else to be seemingly cliche and predictable. Still, this book was still better than the loads of godawful contemporary novels I HAVE read, so if youre looking for a really fastpaced and sweet read with most importantly diversity, then definitely pick this book up! Also, can I just applaud myself for actually writing a full on review after a long time YAY!!!!!!!!
I know, I know, Im like the last person to read this book, but I finally got a hold of it! Honestly, this is a really hard book to review because there has already been so much said about it I dont plan on adding anything incredibly insightful that hundreds thousands of other people havent already mentioned about its sheer awesomeness, but here is what I thought... Unlike a lot of other books I read, I went into The Hunger Games with an expectation that it was going to be incredible. I try not to start a book with any preconceived notions, but in this case I really couldnt help it after hearing so many people raving about it. All in all, I definitely was not disappointed! THG kept me in suspense from beginning to end, wondering what would happen next at every turn in this ultimate fight for survival. Probably one of the things I liked most about this book was the unforgettable characters. Katniss, the female protagonist, was both believable and likable. She had flaws and struggled with things from her past, and this made her very human and very easy to relate to. I loved the fact that she was strong and independent, but she could be very vulnerable as well. As the heroine, Katniss not only fights toothandnail for her life, she also fights against the oppressive regime that forces the Hunger Games on society. This fight for a higher purpose along with her unbreakable spirit brings deeper meaning to the story and makes you even more invested in the fate of the main character. Peeta was a thoroughly likable character as well, even though he remained a mystery until about halfway through the story. Its hard to tell what his motives are right away. Does he really like Katniss or is he just playing The Game? I thought that the relationship between him and Katniss developed in a very natural way it wasnt at all forced. Here is one instance of a love triangle that was not contrived or just thrown in as a plot device to make things more interesting. I really loved Peeta and cant wait to see how his character develops in the later books. And can I just say? I loved Rue! sniffle I think that it is only a very talented writer who can make their secondary characters as memorable as the main ones, and this book had many! Haymitch, Effie, Cinna, Prim all of them, even though they played more minor roles in the story, had their own identity and added something to the plot. Gale was a little more difficult we dont really learn much about him in this book, so it was kind of hard to follow Katniss dilemma about whether she liked Peeta or Gale more, but Im guessing that well learn more about him in the next book of the Trilogy. The actionadventure aspect of this book was AMAZING. This probably isnt too surprising, considering that the plot revolves around a fight to the death in order to keep yourself alive, but it was one of those books where the end of each chapter is just begging you to continue to the next! The Game itself was exciting and suspenseful, and didnt rely too heavily on shockvalue to keep you interested. I think that the ending was slightly predictable, but once again, I think this has more to do with the fact that Ive already heard snippets from other people, and unless I lived under a rock, it would be hard to not have some idea about what was going to happen. The ending was still satisfying enough that I was fully engrossed in the story up until the last pages. The only dilemma that I had with THG was at the beginning, where I had a difficult time understanding Katniss reactions to becoming a Tribute in the Hunger Games. Maybe because she grew up under the reality of knowing that one day she might be chosen to battle to the death? I dont know, but I guess that if I were about to enter a game where I had to kill people before they killed me, and there was little chance of me winning, I would be a lot less concerned about the clothes I was wearing or the food I was eating or the guy I have a crush on. Or hey maybe all those things would start mattering even more! Still, some parts of the Games seemed really overthetop, like with the stylists and the interviews. If I were Katniss, I dont know if I could have played along like she did. Granted, it worked to her advantage in the end... sigh, I guess I just overthink things way too much! THG was a great dystopian fiction and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. However, I dont think its fair to say that this book is the beall, endall of this genre, and I dont plan on setting this as the benchmark to judge future dystopian books by. There are many, many good dystopians that I have read this year, including Ship Breaker, Wither and Divergent. I am just glad to be able to add yet another amazing book to my list it isnt hard to see why this has become an instant classic! Lea  LCs Adventures in Libraryland
We are drawn to stories, and every scar carries one. Rating: 55 If I had to sum up my feelings towards finishing this book, towards the end, since the beginning, in the middle, it would simply be sad, mad, and proud. 3 simple words to sum up my emotions. This will probably be different and longer than most of my reviews, but here goes nothing... Once upon a time, a girl had a father, a prince, a society of friends. Then they betrayed her, and she destroyed them all. Adelina Amouterus heart has suffered at the hands of both family and friends, turning her down the bitter path of revenge. Now known and feared as the White Wolf, she flees Kenettra with her sister to find other Young Elites in the hopes of building her own army of allies. Her goal: to strike down the Inquisition Axis, the whitecloaked soldiers who nearly killed her. But Adelina is no heroine. Her powers, fed only by fear and hate, have started to grow beyond her control. She does not trust her newfound Elite friends. Teren Santoro, leader of the Inquisition, wants her dead. And her former friends, Raffaele and the Dagger Society, want to stop her thirst for vengeance. Adelina struggles to cling to the good within her. But how can someone be good when her very existence depends on darkness? The Rose Society was so different than The Young Elites, it was a sequel I was half expecting. I wasnt expecting Adelina to change so much, to not be afraid to kill. And thats what made me proud! I was so happy to see a change happen in her life. The Rose Society was a dark yet powerful sequel to The Young Elites I am surprised by how much Marie Lu decided to change it up. I am amazed into how dark she made Adelina become; the character she became. Teren is the only character I didnt like and wont continue to. Since the beginning, since he was gonna see Adelina be burned and hurt because of what she did to her father, I hated him. I knew he was going to be the character I would hate. Even his love for the queen didnt change a slightest bit of the hate I have for him. He was a pitiful bastard IMO In this book, we meet many new people but there is 1 that just made my heart happy. Magiano Im sorry, but I shipped him with Adelina more than her and Enzo. That little moment they shared, that small but meaningful kiss they shared. The way he always warned her, helped her, comforted her, cared for her. Sigh. OHHH Magiano. He is someone who may have looked like he didnt care, couldnt catch feelings, was say someone...With dark thoughts or feelings; darkness filled inside them. But deep inside of him, he had a heart for Adelina, a heart for the people he loved. Always had concerned faces. But with Magiano, I am able to smile, even to laugh. I am able to sit here and lean back and point out the constellations. We also meet Sergio , the Rainmaker. If you havent read book 1, then you wont know who he is. But if you had and havent read this book, he is the boy mentioned by Raffaele who was the boy that couldnt control the rain; Adelina thought they killed them. WELL, there he is. The Rose Society I pledge myself to the Rose Society until the end of my days, to use my eyes to see all that happens, my tongue to woo others to our side, my ears to hear every secret, my hands to crush my enemies. I will do everything in my power to destroy all who stand in my way. Maeve Lover of Lucent. Queen of Beldain. Brough Enzo back. Probably regretted it. Character that received some hate from me. reviews now inspired by: Andie and Lissa Reason: I realized reviews should be talking about the book, how it caught my attention, what I did and didnt like about the book, the plot, what I enjoyed or didnt enjoy, not just emotions and feelings summed up into a whole paragraph. Whats it about? The Rose Society picks up right where the Young Elites left off. We see Adelina struggling to change after she is cast out of The Daggers. She is hurt by what she did to them, but what they did to her. Adelina decides to change everything. She knows her name The White Wolf is heard by many and she wants everyone to hear it, to fear it, to fear her. So, she decides to make her own society, have her own army, The Rose Society. She continues to hear her whispers haunting her, trying to control her. And this time, its not only her dad but also Enzo, and its what hurts her so much. She continues to grow her powers, being able to control them, to make others fear them, trick them. She knows what shes doing and she knows if its right or wrong. Teren still wants her dead and the Daggers still want her to stop for revenge. They want her out of the world she never knew about, her world that she never thought about. Darkness is what makes her stronger and feeds her, and all she wants is to take revenge on the people who almost killed her, The Inquisition. She wants to take the throne. Hiding it makes you more beautiful, but revealing it makes you you so wear it proudly. Why 5 stars? The Rose Society wasnt the same, or anything like The Young Elites! Adelina grows to her darker side, her and Violettas relationship as sisters grows but also fades, her nightmares haunt her even more, not letting her control her power; taking over her, her vengeance for Teren and The Inquisition doesnt stop. This was a book that I didnt want to finish. I knew I would be attached to it since I started it. Adelina was a relatable person at times. All she wanted to be was loved, accepted for who she wanted to be. Her sister would just watch her get tortured, beaten up while she got fed with dresses, righteousness, riches, a proud father. The Daggers wouldnt accept her since Enzo saved her. Lucent and Dante, especially. And lets not forget Raffaele, he wanted her dead! Its crazy how she went from being afraid of him and the Daggers, to being able to control Enzo right in front of Raffaele. Now thats the Adelinetta I have been waiting for since the beginning. Adelina was a character I loved since the beginning, and Im pretty sure my love for her will only stay the same, or grow! She made me love her even more. I have been WAITING for her to fight back, to understand why defending herself was worth it. When the whispers haunted her, whispered to her trying to comfront her, I was happy at times but then at times, I just wanted to hug Adelina, tell her it would all be okay. Tell her they werent real. Tell her theyre gone. She knew, but she couldnt cunvulse them off at times and that just made me love the book more. Weird? Final and overall thoughts? To finish off, TRS had an ending that left me with liquid in my eyes. I dont believe they are tears though... I know Marie Lu has something coming up, following these 2 books. Shell create new characters, love and hate will be received by me for them. I already know! But I have faith in her, knowing that where this cliffhanger left us off, will pick itself right up in the 3rd book, The Midnight Star. If you enjoyed The Young Elites, you will definitely LOVE The Rose Society! WOW! I did not expect this review to follow this long path but I might as well consider writing these types of reviews instead, writing the word correctly, correct font, capitalized words and letters when needed. Oh I cant wait for October 11, 2016.
I want to start off by stating that it is very important that you start this series with The Siren if you havent already done so. Though this book is a prequel to the first 4 books, please be aware that The Saint is book 5 of The Original Sinners series. Though this review is spoilerfree pertaining to The Saint, there may be spoilers for those who have not read the previous books. Consider yourself warned. : For the series reading order click here. Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named Eleanor who had secrets she wanted to keep... Before I started this book, I was apprehensive about how the story would be told. If youve read the first four books, youll know that we get glimpses of past events via flashbacks throughout the Red Years books 14. Going in, I thought I knew what to expect because The White Years books 58 were meant to fill us in on what life was like back in the day with Nora and crew. With that in mind, I had a little trepidation about reading a book highlighting Noras virginal years, through the eyes of young Nora. I was worried that Id come away from reading this book with a severe case of blue balls as we know from The Red Years, Nora and Soren dont get romantically involved until she is older, and a desire to be back in the present to see what the gang is up to now from where The Mistress left off. Now, I wish I can go back and slap myself in the face for ever thinking any of those things. Shame on me. True to form, Tiffany knocked it out of the park with this book. It exceeded all my expectations, and once again, the bar was raised when it comes to her storytelling ability. I absolutely LOVE the format in which The Saint is written. The book opens up in the present, and then we are transported to the past as it the events are recounted by presentday Nora. Think of it as a bedtime story that is told to you as you get tucked into bed with a little kinklaced nightcap. Best storytime EVER! Just like the books that preceded this one, the story is told in Third Person POV. The narration bounces back and forth from the present and the past, and even though I thoughtI wouldnt been as keen on learning what the earlier years were like through the eyes of Young Nora, I came to realize that younger Nora was just as compelling as the more mature Nora weve come to know and love. She was just as snarky, sarcastic, bold, vulgar, and unapologetic as always. This book wasnt just about filling in the gaps, or getting better acquainted with her and Sorens relationship its about falling in love by truly using your heart, your mind, and your soul. I wasnt only captivated by the romantic aspects of Soren and Noras relationship, but also by the development of their platonic relationship as well. There were moments that my I had to clutch my pearls as my heart swooned out of control by Sorens words: Now, dont get me wrong, this is not your average girlmeetsboy romantic tale. As we know from the previous books, Nora and Sorens relationship is unconventional in every way possible. In The Saint, we get a firsthand look at all of the obstacles they had to overcome prior to being able to be together. Nora had to learn to crawl before she could walk, and Soren was there to take her through the motions, and to put things in perspective. If you couldnt tell from all my gushing, I was blown away by the writing in this book. Tiffany Reisz is truly a wordsmith. Her stories are powerful, enthralling, and all encompassing. Every word, every scene, every Psalm  Proverb, every character, and even every collar has a purpose in her books. She leaves no stone left unturned with her plot. Tiffanys writing goes beyond being just words on a page that you are meant to read with your eyes, and process with your mind. Her words leap out at you, and tugs at your heart, to the point where they are meant to be felt with your heart. While reading The Saint, I felt the love, the desire, the fear, the indignation, the hope, the heartache, the wonder, and the happiness. I laughed, I swooned, and I overheated. There were even some parts in the book that I would feel a wide array of emotions all at once. For example: My definition of foreplay is usually classified as assault. Obviously you and I are reading different dictionaries. You dont seem to understand the gravity of this situation. I am a sadist. I cannot escape that. My feels after I read that: amusement, fascination, uncertainty, and if Im being honest, even a little excitement, and fullon anticipation. I mean, when it comes to Soren, Im all in. To know Soren is to love him...and whats a little sadism amongst friends? Amirite? Black sheets, anyone? When you pick up your copy of The Saint, throw out any preconceived notions that you think you may have about what you think is going to happen in this book. Yes, its primarily about Nora and Soren, but its so much more. Yes, theres debauchery, theres kink, there are cameos from some of our favorite characters, as well as some new faces. There are plot twists and turns, and as even a little mindfckery in the mix... You have fallen in love with the king of all the mindfuckers. Mindfucking? Is that when you stick it in her ear? Not quite. Its when I stick it in her brain. Bottom line: I adored this book. Bottom line: Soren is officially my alltime favorite literary sadist, and Nora is one of my alltime favorite characters. Bottom line: With every new book in this series, I find myself more and more converted by the gospel of Tiffanys writing. Her books completely alter your conventional aka Vanilla views of love and life. I wish there were more stars I could give this book. This was one of my top reads of 2014. I cant wait to get my hands on the audiobook so that I can relive this story all over again. Add The Saint to Your TBR: Add The Saint to Your Collection: Want a sneak peek of The Saint?

Cress by Marissa Meyer is the third in the Lunar Chronicles. If you havent heard of this series, be sure to check out my reviews of the first book, Cinder, and the second book, Scarlet, because this series is freaking fantabulous! I felt that Scarlet was even better than Cinder, and Cress does not disappoint this trend. While Cress was a slightly different book than the first two, it made my brain feel all warm and fuzzy every time I sat down to read. We meet new characters and get to know old ones better, there is epicness on so many levels, and I am EVEN MORE excited about the fourth book, Winter, than I was before! Note: A friend gave me an ARC of Cress to review. Some things may change in the final version. Cress by Marissa Meyer ARC 4.5 Stars Cress by Marissa Meyer Lunar Chronicles 3 Published by Feiwel  Friends on February 4th, 2014 Genres: Fairytale Retelling, Scifi, YA Length: 560 pages How I got my copy: Borrowed IndieBound  Book Depository  Goodreads Purchases made support this blog Rapunzels tower is a satellite. She cant let down her hairor her guard. In this third book in the bestselling Lunar Chronicles series, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, theyre plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army. Their best hope lies with Cress, who has been trapped on a satellite since childhood with only her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hackerunfortunately, shes just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice. When a daring rescue goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a high price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing stop her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only ones who can. Strengths: I feel that I must start with the title character: Cress! squeals I love her so much! I imagine that many of us are going to have Tangled flashbacks while reading Cress but I honestly think it totally works. Cinder and Scarlet are both kickbutt heroines, but Cress brings something new to the table. She has obviously led a pretty sheltered life with a skewed perspective on things mostly from watching net dramas.... and Meyer captures this wonderfully. Cress is a brilliant hacker but also adorably naive about a lot of things. She is a perfect edition to our fairy tale cast specifically because she isnt the typical kickbutt heroine who is too tough to cry! Omg yall, the twists! You know I love a good plot twist and I consider Cress to have more than one. They were the great kind, too, where they are kinda stressful because you know the characters lives are going to get more difficult, but also make perfect sense, but also just make you have to know what is going to happen! My pulse is rising just thinking about them .. The feels, wow, the feels. Scarlet definitely destroyed my emotions, but Cress doesnt pull any punches. They are made all the worse because you kind of know something has to happen, but its still so freaking emotional. There arent just sad feels though! Thorne and Cress had me squeeing and literally laughing out loud quite often ;. I love clever epic battles! You know when the hero saves the day against impossible odds not through luck or magically discovering some deep inner power but through being so dang clever?? That! That is awesome and that is what you get in Cress. We get little torturous hints about the character Winter and I am so freaking excited! Even though this is Cress, I am already impressed with how multifaceted Winter the character is going to be, not to mention the epicness of Winter the books plot.... Iko gets a couple of chapters from her perspective 3! Weaknesses: There are three couples now for those playing along at home and that is two more than most stories that we are used to have. All of the characters work great yey epic fantasy adventuring party!, but each of the romance pairings being so neat and tidy is a little annoying. I want a single fairytale princess, who needs boys?! Cress melted my heart, but I didnt get the whiteknuckle, edgeofyourseat feel that I had with Scarlet. I hit a point with Scarlet where I was literally getting white knuckles gripping the hardcover, and that just didnt happen with Cress which is probably good since it was a rather floppy ARC. I have very high hopes for Winter though ;. Summary: Really, at this point, you probably already know if you are going to read Cress or not. If you loved Scarlet, you will love Cress and Im so excited and a little jealous that you get to read it for the first time still :D. If you read Cinder and were only meh and not sure about continuing the series, continue the series! I cannot emphasize enough how much each books writing has grown and I love it. Im very impressed by how skillfully Meyer has weaved together three four in the end fairytale retellings, keeping each of the couples involved in the overarching storyline, and building this amazing scifi world to boot. Amazeballs if you ask me.
Reviewed by: Hello Beautiful Book Blog A wonderful collection of stories that take you back to the world of The Lunar Chronicles to experience new enchanting secrets from multiple characters. This is a do not miss for Lunar Chronicles fans! I havent read any of these stories yet even though I think 4 of them have been previously released so I experienced them all together. I read Stars Above after finishing the Lunar Chronicles series. There will be spoilers from the Lunar Chronicles series, but no spoilers from Stars Above. The Keeper We get a look into the past when all of the Lunar Chronicles are set in motion. You will see how Michelle Benoit came to be involved with hiding Princess Selene. You will also get to see how Scarlet came to live with Michelle, her Grandmere. You will learn some secrets about Michelle, Scarlet, and the mysterious Logan. I really loved getting more Michelle. She is one tough lady. I loved how brave she was in the Lunar Chronicles. I was cheering her on in a few different scenes on how resilient she was. This story shows how she wanted Scarlet to be independent, brave, and be able to take care of herself. We get to see how much she cares for Scarlet and why she had to do some of the things she did, for Scarlets sake and the fate of the world. I have even more respect for Michelle after reading this. Great addition to the storyline of Scarlet! Glitches This story is definitely a do not skip. In Glitches we learn how Cinder comes to live with the Linhs. We get some background on Garan and why he decides to help hide the Princess. We see Cinder interact with her new stepmother and stepsisters. Most interestingly we get to see how Cinder feels when she is finally woken from the stasis she has been put in for so many years and how she learns to use her new technology. I really enjoyed getting to learn about how Cinder figured out her abilities and see what it was like being in a new environment without any knowledge of her past. Cinder doesnt remember anything from her previous life and is trying to adapt to her new surroundings. She has plenty of new technology installed in her body to help her along. I love getting to see how new it all feels when things pop up in her vision or her lie detector goes off. I love the snippet of Cinder and Iko, probably because Iko is one of my favorite characters! Glitches was an awesome prequel to Cinder! The Queens Army In The Queens Army we take a look into the life of Zeev Kesley before he was Wolf and how he became Alpha Kesley, special operative in the queens army. We see Wolfs life in the working sectors of Luna, his family, and the rigorous changes to Wolfs body and mind. I needed this scene into Wolfs life before, but I hated reading about them modifying him. I love him and how strong willed he is so it was hard to read about the changes they made to him. I hate that he was forced to fight. UGH. The story was good, but I just felt so sorry for Wolf! Carswells Guide to Being Lucky Oh Lordy, heres my favorite fellow! I want to be Thornes BFF. This story was so important to understand some inner workings of Carswell. The story is set with Carswell being in high school and he needs a tutor for one of his classes. He doesnt see the point and just wants to make money to one day own a rampion. Something simple and sensible since his parents are anything but. We see his family and their relationships. I love getting a look into Carswells former life. Thorne is the same witty, conniving guy who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants. He definitely uses people, but still has a good heart at his core. After Sunshine Passes By This is the story of how Cress was placed on the satellite to become the spy for Luna. First showing the bunks she resided in with the other Lunar shells. It doesnt go into great detail about what type of testing they endured, just touched on having to give blood whenever they wanted it. Then one day, Mistress Sybil comes and informs Cress she will be leaving Luna. It broke my heart to see the excitement of Cress getting to leave Luna and then the disappointment when she is placed on the podship, alone. It must have been such a scary time, going from constant companionship in the dorm to complete solitary confinement. I am so glad Cinder and friends were able to get her off the ship in Cress and no wonder she went to willingly. This wasnt my favorite story out of them all, but still liked reading about Crescent Moon. The Princess and the Guard This is the story of Winter before everything transpired in the Lunar Chronicles. This story is a little longer than the others, giving a ton of insight into Winters mind. It starts with Winter and Jacin playing a game of the princess and the guard. It was sweet to see them as children without so many worries in life. The most important theme in this story is the struggle Winter is having with her Lunar gift. We see in Winter that the princess has already given up using her gift and in The Princess and the Guard we find out why. This story broke my heart to see the relationship between Winter and Jacin. They are both very loyal to one another, especially Jacin. They kind of have a forbidden romance, because the queen wants Winter to marry for political gain. This is before Jacin is a royal guard and I liked seeing him less formal. We didnt get enough of that in Winter. I also really liked seeing Winter use her gift in the beginning. It was definitely different since she didnt use her gift for anything bad. She is good at her core, but even the good she thinks she is doing really isnt good at all. After I finished, I just felt really sad for them since their lives are basically taken out of their hands and I hate it for them. Good addition to Winter! The Little Android This is a fairy tale retelling loosely based on The Little Mermaid set in the Lunar Chronicles world. It starts out with an android who feels a little different than the other androids she sees around her. Some things occur and she sets out on her own with a lost locket in tow in search of a new body. She finds Linh Cinder and her plans are starting to shape up. I thought it was going to be a story about Iko for a minute, but alas. I enjoyed reading this story. It was interesting, had some romance, but I felt depressed after finishing it. Marissa Meyer is eloquent as always with her way of intertwining a story. The Mechanic This is the story of Cinder and Prince Kais first meeting told from Kai perspective. No new information here, but I loved getting to see what Kai felt and how he saw and perceived Cinder the first time he laid eyes on her. I love Kaito so it was nice seeing this scene play out through his eyes. Something Old, Something New This is an epilogue after Winter. I knew there was a wedding in this book and couldnt wait to get there. I am not going to say much about this because I want it to be a surprise. I didnt realize whose wedding it was and just assumed. It was sweet seeing all of the couples together at once. That concludes the extras from The Lunar Chronicles. I hate to see this series come to an end, although it was an epic one. I love how all of Marissas stories are so flawlessly executed. The Lunar Chronicles is one of my favorite series I have ever read. So unique and intertwined perfectly. Must read.
So this is it. Its the end of the Anna and the French Kiss series. Technically. I mean, we all know Im going to reread them all forever so its never really over. Honestly, this book was a bit of a disappointment. I still enjoyed it, hence my rating of I liked it on goodreads, but I didnt love it, and it doesnt stick out in my mind like Anna does, or even Lola. Plot Ill admit, I was a little creeped out by how obsessed Isla was with Josh. Im soooo glad that in this one, we didnt have to deal with one of the love interests having a boyfriend or a girlfriend, because I hate when it creates the kind of love triangle but not really because we all know that the significant other is going to be dropped eventually. With that being said though, I could have used for a little bit more of some friendship between Isla and Josh before they became a couple, I feel like I lost some chemistry between them. I wish we had more of the building of the relationship, I didnt really feel satisfied with well weve just always liked each other explanation. I did love the little things in this plot that made it unique, such as Joshs graphic novel project, just to name one. A lot of the moments they shared together in this book were really adorable though, and I liked the trips they took, and the moments they had. I liked how there was subplot of sibling relationships, I wasnt expecting that and I think it was a nice touch. Also, I wanted to commend Perkins for putting sex in a YA novel, because I dont really know why its so tiptoed around with, its not like only college kids are having sex. Writing I love Perkins writing. I forgot how much I loved it, and remembered when I read Lola earlier. Its funny, and the internal dialogue sounds real, and the parts where a character is talking to them self, and realizing a truth about themselves, sometimes that can be written really badly, where it doesnt seem like natural internal dialogue, but she does it wonderfully. She can write settings beautifully. You really feel like youre there, and I would look up pictures of the things she mentions, and looking at the picture whilst reading her descriptions makes you realize how well she writes the descriptions. The settings of her books are a huge part of it for me, and in contemporaries usually setting isnt a big factor. Although, I do wish there was a little bit more description in Paris. Characters Im always so conflicted on her characters, like I absolutely love them for the most part, but then sometimes I just want to strangle them. As for Isla and Josh as a couple, I think theyre my least favorite couple of the three, but I still thought they were adorable. I just didnt feel the same chemistry I did with LolaCricket, and AnnaSt.Clair. I think its due to them getting together so early in the book. As of 82614, Ive been stewing over my feelings on them, and the result: I have none. While reading I thought they were cute, but I didnt think twice about them after finishing it, where as I am still constantly thinking about AnnaSt.Clair and LolaCricket. The couple just didnt make an impact on me. Josh on his own though: I loved him. St.Clair is still my alltime favorite, but oh Josh, what a tortured artist. He was just so lovable, with his brooding exterior, and his tattoos, and torn soul. I think him being a graphic novelist was an awesome thing to put in the story, and I thought his quirks with him having ink on him, or just needing to stop and draw were just so endearing. I dont think I was the biggest fan of Isla. For the most part, I think I liked her? She never really made an impression on me until I started to not like her. I could relate to her insecurities, and being fearful of taking risksto a point. I got really frustrated with her at one point near the end, if youve read the book you know what point Im talking about. I understand that it was a crucial point in her character arc and development, but I was still so pissed off and angry. I thought she was being histrionic, and irrational. She seemed the most immature out of all of our main female protagonists, and I think she might be my least favorite. While I had issues with Lola during her book, it was all a part of the plot, and as a character I liked Lola a lot better. The character development was done well though overall, and I do appreciate that. I thought it was awesome how Kurt was a part of the story, and how he had highfunctioning autism. Perkins always is good with putting in diversity in her books, so kudos to her. Kurt was really interesting to read about, and I did really like him. I do wish he was more developed though, Im glad she put him there, but I didnt feel like she did anything with him. I was SO happy to see all the characters from the other books at the end, and it just made me so happy to see the more that I always want at the end of the other books. Although, as Ariel mentioned, if the best part of the book for you was seeing OTHER characters from OTHER books, that may be a bad thing, and I do see her point. Characterwise, I just couldnt connect like I could in her other books. Overall I think this was a good conclusion to this companion trilogy. I think the whole trilogy wrapped up very nicely, and this book itself wrapped up very nicely. At the time of reading it, it was super cute, and gave me all the happy feelings; but looking back on it, its by far the least memorable out of the three for me, and I really think it has to do with the characters. Even though I enjoyed the overall plot of this book more than Lola, I really liked Cricket and Lola as protagonists a lot more, so I was much more invested in their story. I think this book was still a nice read, and I am very glad I read it, but I do think its the weakest one in the trilogy. As I let my thoughts on the book simmer, new things came to light, and Ive refined my opinions. While I still think this series is a GREAT fluffy and cute contemporary series, that is definitely one of my favorites, its not without its flaws. I would recommend them to literally anybody I know though, because even with the flaws, I still think anybody can and will enjoy them.
A true pageturner. This isnt just a Colleen Hoover book, its THE Colleen Hoover book. Wow! Just, wow! I have been a longtime fan of CoHo since her first days of Hopeless and Slammed, but I have to admit, over the years her books never won me over like those first few did. I still enjoyed all her books and her writing is so thoughtprovoking and emotional, but I just never got that same amazed or aweinspiring feeling. That is, until this book. I totally went into this thinking it would be just another CoHo book. Little did I know that it would be THE CoHo book. As some of you may know, I havent been as much of a reader this year as I have been in the past. Even less so are times youll see me really engaged in a book to the point where I cant put it down. That has only happened twice this year, but now It Ends With Us will make it three. Let me preface this review by saying, dont let the synopsis fool you. Yes, there is a love triangle of sorts in the book, but its not exactly what you think. That aspect of the book is merely a fraction of the what actual story is about and it certainly doesnt take away from the real focus of the plot, at least not in the way you would believe. I urge those that are hesitant about love triangles to still give this one a shot, because once you read this book, you wont know what hit you. Lily is just plain amazing. I couldnt have asked for a better character. I genuinely liked her right from the start and going through this journey with her was unbelievable. I loved every minute of it, even when it broke my heart, or made me see RED. I truly felt for this girl and all she went through in the past and while in the present with Ryle and Atlas. I loved that she chased after her dream, despite how scary it was. I loved that she was willing to take chances and give people the benefit of the doubt. And I loved how fiercely she loved and how strong of a person she is. There were a lot of times throughout this book where I didnt know what choices she would make and how her relationship with Ryle would play out. It couldve gone one of many ways, but ultimately, Im so happy with how it ended. Its bittersweet, but still just as fantastic. As for Ryle, I must admit that he is quite the charmer. He knew exactly what to say and often surprised me with how honest he was. I really, really loved Lily and Ryles naked truth thing. Thats quite possibly my favorite thing about their relationship. Anyways, Ryle had his good moments, his bad moments, and also his really bad moments. I appreciate CoHo for writing him the way that she did. And Atlas, he was a gem and I really wish I had seen more of him. Hes definitely important to the overall story and his relationship with Lily is palpable at times, but yeah, I wanted more. I dont know if going in you as the reader will know what exactly the subject matter is about, but in case you dont what Im about to say next will be placed under the SPOILER section. I considered leaving it out, but I simply cannot talk about this book without talking about the subject matter. Just know that I wont discuss specifics, like what happens to the characters, just my personal thoughts and opinions on it. The SPOILER warning is just for those who dont want to know what the subject matter is until they actually read it. Domestic abuse. I used to think it was all black and white. If the guy turns out to be abusive, just leave the bastard, and I never could empathize with the women who choose to stay in those kinds of relationships, especially when they have children. Children arent stupid. They know when their parents arent getting along. They hear the arguments. They see the bruises. How can you just let them go through that and still want to be with that jerk?! If that ever happened to me, I would leave and not give it a second thought. There are no second chances for men like that. At least, that what I used to think... While I wont say that CoHo truly changed my views and thoughts on this topic, she definitely opened my eyes more to it and made me hesitate when I think about what I would do in this situation. I have always stood by the code that if the guy Im with beat me or cheated on me, I would leave him. Thats it. Thats the end. Everyone who knows me know this about me and I made sure to let my husband know this about me before we ever discussed marriage. On this, I would never waver. But then, CoHo got me thinking...people are human and mistakes happen. How can we fault someone for one mistake?! Especially after so many years of love and trust?! I could go on and on about my thoughts on this subject, but suffice it to say, she definitely made me step back and really think about what I would do in a situation like this. Ill be the first to admit that Im quick to blame the woman for deciding not to leave the guy who beats her. Dont get me wrong, my initial thought has and will always be that the guy is a rat bastard and should burn in hell, but then I think that the woman could just as easily leave and be done with him. She is the one letting this be done to her and shes weak. For those thoughts, Im truly sorry. It definitely takes a strong woman to put up with that kind of abuse, especially around her children, at least in most instances. I cant speak for the whole of abused women, but yeah, after reading this, let me just say that I understand and empathize just a bit more. Hands down, this is my favorite CoHo book, which is surprising because I never thought any of her books would dethrone Slammed. I firmly believe that because this book hit so close to home for CoHo herself, thats what makes this one stand out. She poured her heart, soul, and literal tears into this book and you can see it in every line she wrote and in every action and thought her characters had. Its not often that once Im done reading a book, I immediately want to reread it, but thats definitely the case here, despite knowing that it will wreck me all the same when I read it again. This story and its characters stayed with me for days after reading this book and that hardly ever happens. Oh, and that Authors note?! Broke. My. Damn. Heart. I seriously want to hug CoHo so bad and I also want to say how amazing her mother truly is.
After collecting my thoughts about it for some days, Ive settled on a 2 star rating. I didnt have the worst time reading it, even if some things really irritated me; but overall I cant really say it was an enjoyable experience, nor that it lived up to the expectations. Luckily, I waited a while to read it because I had read many negative reviews, and so I was also prepared when I did. But... yeah. Not good, sorry. I will say this, however: I do think it is important to remember this is a script. This was written to be staged and so I can understand some of its defects. Also, from what I read the play looks impressive, and I would like to see it on stage though I probably never will. Moving on to my review, this will be a long one so I apologize in advance. I organized it in things I liked and didnt like, hoping that this way it will be more organized Im not sure I succeeded...: Things I liked:  The nostalgia factor. Yes, this play was very different from the books and not nearly as good like talking about the ocean and a puddle. Yeah., but I still was incredibly happy to dive back into this world. So I think the nostalgia factor made me like this story more not much more, but a tiny bit.  Scorpius Malfoy. Predictable, I know, because everybody loved Scorpius, but he is without a doubt the best thing in this story. Socially awkward, loyal, sweet... he is just so adorable, I wanted to hug him all the time! Nobody cares about your name anymore, Scorpius, we just love you!  Draco Malfoy. Scorpius is precious, but Draco is also fantastic. Okay, maybe he is OOC as well because he has become a great person and a great parent... but what can I say, Ive always liked Draco even in the books, and I always thought he had the potential to become good. And he did. He was sooo much better than anyone in this play, apart of course from his son. So, yes, Malfoy power!  Scorpius and Albuss relationship. Okay, actually I have some reserves about it. On one hand, I really liked them, and I thought they were adorable. On the other hand, Albus was such a jackass, even with Scorpius, that he ruined many of their scenes together. The scene where Scorpius shouts at him was by far my favourite of the whole play. He deserved it so badly! So yes, it is a pity Scorpius was so perfect, and Albus was so annoying. Also, a special mention for ScorpiusRose. Again, I have ambivalent feelings: it wasnt satisfying at all, because Rose treated him very badly for no reason at all, and they had like two scenes together, but they were still cute. However, if I have to be honest to myself, I probably only liked them because I was attracted to the ScorpiusRose ship which had sailed right after the 7th books epilogue. What can I say, I always liked Dramione but Romione remains THE ship. Things I didnt like:  The plot is all over the place, as many readers have already pointed out. I will not go into huge details, but I will say what irked me the most. Firstly, this story doesnt feel like a Harry Potter canon AT ALL. Im sorry, but in my head this is not the 8th book. Maybe it is not exactly a fan fiction either but it does feel like it, but it seems like a story in itself, like an alternative universe sort of story. This is mostly because, and this is the second thing which irritated me the most, the plot has huge holes which are incompatible with the books, especially the 7th. Obviously Im talking about Voldemort and Bellatrix having a child right before the battle of Hogwarts. Again, doesnt this feel like a Bellamort fanfic? Anyway, the idea in itself is not very believable, but can we please talk about the timeline? If they really had this child right before the Battle of Hogwarts, how in hell was Bellatrix able to fight after giving birth? Okay, maybe wizards have some very powerful potions for this sort of things. I can accept that. But then why didnt anybody realize, when they were at Malfoy Manor, that Bellatrix was pregnant? Because she must have been then. So, no, sorry, not buying this part at all.  The characters are OOC. Im sorry, but everyone, more or less, is very different from the characters in the book. I quite liked Ginny, but the Golden Trio felt so off, I couldnt like any of them. Hermione seemed a shadow of her former self, and I wont even start on her version in the universe where she and Ron didnt get married. But Ron and Harry were so much worse for me. Ron is only a comic relief: he is a bumbling idiot and doesnt have a purpose. It made me so mad because he is one of my favourite characters in the books, and he is so much more than that. But Harry? Can we talk about Harry?! Harry, who for years suffered bullying and psychological abuse by the Dursleys, and then acts so terribly with his son? I know Albus is insufferable, but still I refuse to accept that Harry would say to him that he wished he wasnt his son, and then keep him apart from his only friend. NO. WAY. And what about Cedric Diggory becoming a death eater only because he was shamed in the Triwizard Tournament? NOOO!!  The new characters arent much better. As I said, I hated Albus, he was so full of himself and only thought about his problems, it was hard to feel pity for him. His siblings seemed better... but they have like one line in the whole play. Why?? Why didnt they have a bigger role? This was so disappointing. And what about Rose? She appears a little more, but still very little, and she seems mostly unpleasant for no good reason. His parents seem to have gotten along decently with Draco, so I dont see why Rose should be so mean to Scorpius. Also, the speech about her and Albus being able to choose whatever friends they want because their parents are famous? Seriously?!  And what about the characters who arent there? Again, I know this is a play, and the cast of characters is already quite impressive. I can understand and justify it, but Im still pissed we didnt see Teddy and Remus Lupin, Neville Longbottom and Sirius Black. Maybe including Teddy would have been difficult because he didnt much fit in the plot, but Neville? He was mentioned so many times that I was sure he would appear, and I was all ready to see him as a finally confident, content adult, and yet he didnt appear at all. And Remus and Sirius? Again, maybe I am not objective because they are my favourite characters, but many dead characters appeared, so why couldnt they as well? So... yeah. I am sort of happy I read this so I could form an opinion myself, but I will definitely not reread it in the future and I will try to forget the worst part and only focus on Draco and Scorpius Malfoy. And reread the ACTUAL books.
Continuing on my trend of reading the super hyped and popular books late, I finally read Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo and the sequel too but shhh the review is coming later. And let me just say, wow! I now understand why these books are so loved by the whole book blogging community. The writing is superb, the characters are precious, and the plot is so fast paced and intriguing, with tons of twists and turns, and an overall theme of darkness. No mourners. No funerals. This book centers around a group of fugitives, thieves, assassins, and witches as they try to do the impossible: break into the impenetrable Ice Court and retrieve a hostage. Now that I look back on it, that really is the main plot in the book, but that doesnt mean the story is straightforward. Far from it. While the plot is actionpacked, this really is a character driven story, which Ill talk about later on. The relationships in this story between all the different crew members shift and change and are a main focus of the story as well. Now one of the main misconceptions I had before reading was that the crew was going to become this group of best friends, where they all trust each other with their secrets and protect each other 100. This is false. Most of the crew hates each other in the beginning, and there really is only one pairing of best friends. They all grudgingly respect each other, and throughout the story begin to protect each other with their own lives, even if it is only because they recognize that the other person is a necessary part of their operation, but they never become the secret whispering, best friend group that I had pictured. A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who has become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse. That being said, I absolutely loved all the characters, although I had my issues with some of them. They were not the noble, honest, obviously good characters, but dark, twisted, tormented, and murky characters. Theres Kaz Brekker, the leader of the operation. Hes cruel and calculating, but a mastermind and fearless. Next is Inej, the Wraith or the spider of the group. Shes tiny, silent, and deadly, but also faithful and optimistic and observant and also one of my favorite characters. We have Jesper, the sharpshooter of the crew. Hes goofy, lighthearted, and has a penchant for gambling, but ultimately is loyal to his crew and brings laughter when they are on the brink of death. Theres Wylan, the baby of the group. Hes used as the bargaining coin, but has other skills such as creating bombs. The fifth member of the group is Nina my other favorite character. Shes flirty, fearless, and magical. Literally, she has magic powers that let her control peoples breathing and pulse and emotions. But shes also loyal, honest, and loving, bringing humanity to her. The last member is Matthias, an exmilitary man and escaped fugitive. He is the brute force of the operation, as well as the actual trained killer. Together, these six characters make for a deadly group. As I said earlier, Nina and Inej are my favorite characters. They both have the most heart, in my opinion, and the ability to actually care for someone else. They are fearless and strong, but understand that emotions are not a weakness. Their friendship is also one of the most heartwarming parts of the book. They are friends not only for survival, but because their personalities mesh together and they understand each other. Sometimes, theyd be on the brink of death, or about to embark on a deadly mission, and their conversation would still bring a smile to my face because of the obvious love they have for each other and the comfort they feel around each other. There was no part of him that was no broken, that had not healed wrong, and there was no part of him that was not stronger for having been broken. I have some issues with Kaz, because of how cruel he is, and how he almost seems to have no conscience. As the book goes on, he becomes more human, but he still is so cold and calculating, never letting himself give in to the emotions he is feeling or show mercy. I understand, they are basically fighting for their lives throughout the book, so mercy would be poorly placed, but there are times when he shouldve forgiven easier and sooner, or given second chances. That being said, I can appreciate him for the mastermind he is, and can respect his mind and how he is able to put together almost impossible schemes and operations to achieve his goals. His dedication to a cause is extraordinary. My last note about the characters before I move on is how diverse their crew is. There are physically disabled characters, many different races and religions represented, a couple members of the LGBTQIA community, and some mental limitations represented. Im sure Im forgetting some of the diversity represented, but honestly it was so great to see these characters so different from each other in such a natural way, and so real. Next in this super long review is my raving about the world building. It was just superb. Each nation was given an identity, and the entire city of Ketterdam, with its rival gangs, felt as much a part of the story as the actual plots and characters did. Plus, all the rivalries felt real and deep, not just thrown in there for drama. But my main example of the amazing world building done is the Grisha. Bardugo basically created a race of humans with magical abilities, so obviously there was a lot of information that needed to be disclosed about them, including about the people that hunt them down and kill them. Also, apparently her other series is a whole Grisha series?! Whaaaaaat?!. But all the information felt seamlessly woven into the story, so there was never a large info dump paragraph that disrupted the flow of the story. The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true. And then theres the romance. As we all know, Im a huge fan of romance, and the romance between Nina and Matthias was perfectly written. It never overtook the story, but was developed all the same. It shows how complex love can be, and how love requires compromise. They are now one of my favorite ships in a YA book, just because of how real it felt to me also they are one of my favorite tropes. And thats it with this super rave review! When I was going into the story, I did not expect to love it as wholeheartedly as I did, but I could not put this book down. Everything about it is so masterfully done that it deserves five stars.
Pushing the limits by Katie Mcgarry is one of my favorite Young Adult stories that Ive come across in recent years. It wasnt the most original or even the most exciting, unputdownable novel Ive picked up by any stretch but McGarry made me fall in love with all of the characters. Echo and Noah felt real and so did their families and friends. These were people that tugged at my heart strings without it ever once feeling like emotional manipulationsomething that I avoid like the plague in other novels. e.g: Fault in our Stars, anything Nicholas Sparks. This is a review for J.L Armenouts The problem with Forever so Im sure youre wondering, Why all the gushing about a different book? Well, the answer is a simple one. The Problem with Forever was a lot like Pushing the limits for me. All of the really amazing parts about reading this easily overshadowed the handful of things that bugged me. Mallory and Riders story is definitely a romance but, much like with Echo and Noah, their story goes beyond the female protagonist blushing every other page. Or the teenage heartthrob in shining armor saying something totally swoon worthy right on queue. This is a story about childhood abuse and the suffering thats very real in the lives of too so many children in the Foster system. It also shows that heartbreaking endings arent limited to orphans. Even in the moments where I knew exactly what would happen next I never got bored. I never lost interest in wanting to see how it would all turn out for Mallory and Rider. I was pleasantly surprised with how excited I was to get to the moment in the story when Mallory, and perhaps even Rider realized that it wasnt just the latters pension for being a hero her herothat kept them connected. I looked forward to the I love you moment and I couldnt even bring myself to roll my eyes at the cheesy moments in between. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: Can someone please explain to me when and how Puerto Rican became a language? I cringed every time Mallory described the Spanish being spoken as speaking Puerto Rican. Please correct me if Im wrong but last I checked Puerto Ricans dont have their own separate language. Slang? Idioms? Of Course. Pretty much every culture does. But language? I scratched my head, wondering how this made it through the editing phase. And since Im already on the subject of language, I found the way Armentrout mixed Spanish into the otherwise English dialogue Hector, Jayden and Rider spoke to be awkward as Hell. Their dialogue felt forced, as if she wanted emphasis on the fact that she had diverse Hispanic characters in her book. For example, when Hector would say the whole sentence in English, but then end it with bebe. It was weird. Im from NYC. Ive lived diversity all my lifeespecially throughout my educationand even if my Americaborn Latino friends were fluent in their native language, their Spanglish did not sound anything like the Hispanic characters in this book. Anddddd.....thats it, I think. I suppose I could come back and edit this later to add another addendum to the dislike list if it comes to mind. But as Ive said already, the good pretty much outweighed the bad in this book. Sure, theres one very big thing I hated about the story but that had more to do with my love of the characters rather than the story lines. WHAT I DID LIKE: Riders girlfriend Paigeaka the fauxobstacle keeping the two love interests apartYeah, she was actually a lot more than that. I love the fact that she served as more than a typical Young Adult Romance trope. And even as cruel as she was okay, so that part was pretty consistent with the evilsoontobeEx formula, as the story developed I could see her as more than a cardboard cut out of every overthetop mean girl you come across in stories of teenage romance. In fact, if youd allow me to indulge in yet another TV show comparisonPaige was a lot like Blair Waldorf in the sense that her motivations were very much driven by human emotions that went beyond superficial envy of a girl who gets the guy she wants. Yes, the dialogue was supercheesy at times, but it never took away from the swoonworthiness that is Rider Stark. He was almost too good to be true. Hes the second thing I enjoyed about The Problem with forever. I hate his name, by the way. I did however love his character even more than I hated the first name Rider. And as for his last name Stark...if youre familiar with Game of Thrones, I must point out that the last name definitely fit when it came to his childhood. The Starks always seem to get the short end of the stick, they always seem to finish last. But they also never stop fighting for themselves and the peoplethings they hold dear. Rider never stopped fighting either. Rider was a hero I actually believed in. He was the rare hero I genuinely enjoyed from beginning to end. But what I loved most was how Rider and Mallory found strength within themselves AND each other. This is something that doesnt happen often enough in romance novels where the two love birds are supposed to be two halves of a whole. This wasnt your typical Reformed bad boy saves helpless little IdontthinkImprettycause Imaverage Damsel in distress scenario. I only wanted to punch Mallory and tell her to man up on maybe one occasion that isnt immediately coming to mind. This honestly feels like a first for me. Normally I always end up complaining about how the female needed validation from her crush, how she needed him to hold her hand through every little thing. And it always pisses me off. The problem with forever was a refreshing twist on two teenagers in love genuinely beingI cant believe Im saying this, ughMFEO. Mallory and Rider were Yin and Yang in that they truly did balance one another. My mother used to tell me all the time, You cant help those that dont help themselves, and I believe it more and more as I get older. In the end Mallory saved herself. Yes, she had her beau there to help her through but she wasnt helpless alone, she wasnt a damsel anymore, in the end. Mallory literally stood up on her own. And I fucking LOVED that! The problem with forever also made me cry, People. And no this isnt another thing to tack on to the list of things I did like, because who the Hell LIKES crying when its not from laughing too hard? Me turning on the waterworks is merely the direct result of the main reason I enjoyed the book as much as I did. I cared. J.L Armentrout created characters that I not only enjoyed getting to know. I actually gave a damn what happened to each and every one. I rooted for them, the way I rooted for Noah in Pushing the limits. Even the antagonist Paige, the obligatory jealous, angry, evil female that every Young Adult novel just has to haveeven she was someone I could empathize with. All of her spite, her inyourface loathing and disdain for Mallory never felt overdone, or unwarranted for that matter, when it came down to it. So, while I have had issues with Armentrouts books in the past, this is one that I would definitely recommend. In fact, I already have. And Im excited to see how my siblings feel about it. 4.5 Stars because it wasnt perfect, but pretty damn close.
5 Raw and Naked Truth Stars This book ruined me. It spoke to me. It touched me. It made me laugh and fall in love and cry and beg for everything to be different but nothing to be different at all. I suspect this book will touch a lot of people, but itll speak in a different level with only some, and itll ruin even fewer. In any case, I doubt people will regret reading it. I know I didnt. Lets just started by putting it out there that Im a Colleen Hoover fan. Her writing speaks to me. I havent read all of her books yet, but the few Ive read are amongst my favorites from this category and genre. It Ends With Us is this authors best and most powerful book. No doubt. I dont want to give spoilers, because I went into this book with no info other than what the blurb reveals, and OMG that was the best decision ever. Guys, do it. Dont read spoilers because itll make the whole experience a thousand times better. Trust me on this one. So if you see a spoilery review: Instead of going into a detailed version of what happened, Ill just talk about the characters because this is a characterdriven story and the people we got to know and follow were the best part of this book. We can start with compassionate, strong, bemybestfriend Lilly. I dont know what it is with Colleen and her MCs, but she always writes women that I want to be friends with. I LOVED Tate from Ugly Love and I love the women she wrote in this book, especially Lilly, whos so flawed that shes almost perfect. Lilly who couldnt think of five good things to say about her dad when he died, so she stood up there and said nothing. Lilly who grabbed knives to defend the people she loved. Lilly who rescued homeless people because she couldnt sit and watch them hurt. Lilly who wrote to Ellen DeGeneres because she is a super cool and funny lady. Lilly who fell in love with a neurosurgeon and couldnt see him in scrubs without wanting to jump him. Lilly who couldnt forget her first love. Lilly who made the right decision simply because she chose love. Lilly who made me laugh and cry and love her, just to hate her and love her back. Lilly whos still making me tear up as I write this review because she portrayed her flawed, independent, smart and strong women can be. I really, really loved Lilly. I wish she were real because I really, really want to hug her right now. Then we have Ryle. OMG, Ryle. The man who made me fall in love with him hard. He was smart, honest, ambitious, hot, sexy and had an intensity about him that made it impossible not to be drawn to him. He practically got down to his knees and begged me to love him. Then he scooped me up and took me high, so high. Then he dropped me and ruined me. Just to pick me up again before dropping me one more time. The emotional rollercoaster this character took me.... The damn rollercoaster! I felt it all. I was Lilly and I loved him and hated him. I was Lilly, and that is the best thing I can say about Colleen Hoovers writing, because when it comes to Ryle, she made me feel every single thing her protagonist did for this man, and it hurt like fuck. Enter Atlas, and Im almost on the floor because I dont think I can take anymore. Those letters reminded me of what Colleen did with Miles POV chapters in Ugly Love because they took me back and they made me feel way too much. Atlas was perfection. He was in need of rescue and at the same time he was rescuing Lilly, even back when he had nothing but his love to give her. My heart hurt for him and for what life had thrown his way. Then it inflated when I saw how far he came, and everything he did with his life. He was a fighter in more ways than one, and he fought his odds and won. I loved Atlas from the first moment, and much like Lilly, I never stopped loving him. He didnt mess with my emotions the way Ryle did, but my feelings for him were still strong. Aside from these three major characters, I also loved Allyssa. Loved, loved everything about her. Her friendship with Lilly was perfection. Her marriage was amazing. Her sense of humor was spot on. Everything about Allyssa was right because she was exactly the kind of side character needed to break the heaviness surrounding this story. Colleen knew she had a weapon in Allyssa and she didnt overuse it, because she showed up when she was needed and she acted exactly the way we needed her to give some balance to the story. Because if you went into this book thinking you were going to get a light, swoony and sexy read, then Im sorry because you were probably really shocked. This book had swoony and sexy moments, but light isnt a word that can describe it. It was raw. It was powerful. It was exactly what I needed without even realizing how much so. I adored its stylegoing from narratives in the present to letters that detailed the past. Showing us little details, like Lillys tattoo, and then later using the past to explain and put those details into perspective. Giving us the chance to fall for characters with every step they took. Then allowing us to experience rage, then sorrow, then pity, all without taking away the love. Then delivering scene after scene toward the end that made me feel so many things together than I could barely breathe. That scene in the hospital when Lilly makes her decision? Wanting to hold Ryle while also understanding and agreeing with everything that was happening? Gutwrenching. Dont even get me started on how that scene explained the title and gave it a beautiful meaning. Or how the last line in the book made me gasp. Or how perfect that ending was. Or how much I loved and hated these characters and wanted to give all of them a group hug. Yep, this book ruined me. In the very best way possible. Thank you, Colleen, for not holding back and for writing such a beautiful and painful story. Thank. You.
Absolutely amazing. An emotional, powerful, piercing and heartfelt story of love and friendship, loss and surviving the difficult side effects of dying. Beautifully written and deserving of all the praise it has garnered, I will never forget the gripping story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. 6 stars.  But it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he has Cassius note, The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars  But in ourselves. There are so many things I LOVED about this book. So many elements... so many big things and subtle things. I loved seeing the witty dialogue come to life through elegant and elaborate syntax. I loved that John Green didnt talk down to his young adult readers, but rather banked on their intelligence, referencing greats like William Carlos Williams and T.S. Eliot the poem mentioned at one point, The Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock is one of my alltime favorites. I loved that he captured the transcendental and deep musings of insightful teenagers, particularly those whom are terminally sick and suddenly find themselves short of time and forced to more seriously ponder the profound and interminable questions that plague their thoughts. And perhaps most significantly, I love that he was able to engender this story that so completely captured my heart, then shattered it into a million little pieces and was nonetheless able to deliver a thoughtful, honest glimpse into painful world of cancerverse. This is a story that is simultaneously complex and simple...we see introspective, esoteric reveries juxtaposed with the irrefutable reality that dying simply sucks. Because there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. There is no honor in dying of. Hazel is dying. 16 years old. Thyroid cancer. Mets in the lungs. She walks around with an oxygen tank and a cannula affixed to her nostrils at all times, helping to deliver air to her lungs that sucked at being lungs. Shes an intelligent, thoughtful girl who challenges the expected cancer platitudes espoused by the nonsick who mean well, but in the end, are only successful in making the sick feel like others. Forced to contemplate the sadness and reality of her imminent demise, as well as of those around her, she questions the usefulness of her cancer support group, where despite challenged to live her best life today, names read off a list of those whom are no longer there, make it clearly evident that you can only cheat death for so long. And its at this support group where she one day meets the boy who would leave his scar on her. My name is Hazel. Augustus Waters was the great satcrossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I wont be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. Gus knew. Gus knows. I will not tell you our love story, becauselike all real love storiesit will die with us, as it should. Augustus Gus Waters lost his right leg to osteosarcoma and is now in remission. Hes a friend of Issac, another friend in the support group who lost an eye at a young age and has recently been told that his other eye must be removed, leaving him to be permanently blind. Augustus is immediately captivated by Hazel and the two form a friendship that was fated to be so much more. Hazel has already survived so much, permanently living in pain, fighting for every breath, every single moment of her life. However, its not the pain that plagues her, its the fear of leaving those she loves behind... leaving them to be shells of who they used to be. Augustus quickly becomes someone she cares about and shes afraid shell leave him wounded in her battle too. I wanted to know that he would be okay if I died. I wanted to not be a grenade, to not be a malevolent force in the lives of people I loved. Their relationship is simply unadulterated beauty. Its so special watching two kindred spirits, two clever quirky people connect so completely. Hazel and Augustus are not strangers to pain, and their individual fears are so real and warranted and heartfelt that they real gut you, because you know as the reader that in a book about two kids with cancer, a happy ending is not in the stars. I love the fact that they are so thoughtful, the terminality of their life forcing them to ponder the bigger, unanswerable questions of life. Its incredibly moving and heartbreaking to read about these brave young kids and how they wrap their minds around cancer and death. Thats the thing about pain, Augustus said, and then glanced back at me. It demands to be felt I also loved that despite their transcendental musings and their expertise in the vernacular of cancer, they were kids... teenagers who played video games and obsessed over a book An Imperial Affliction by the drunk recluse, yet brilliant Peter Van Houten. I found myself so quickly entrenched in this story, deeply devoted to its characters, prematurely distressed at what was yet to come. The fact that they fall in love is even harder to experience because I was so happy for them and at the same time, so very sad. Augustus is amazing, never afraid to be forthright about his feelings, while Hazen is more cautious with her expressions, but with such a loving heart just the same. Together, they are perfect. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities ... There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbound set. But Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldnt trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and Im grateful. I actually experienced this book via audible, in a version narrated by Kate Rudd. She was amazing too. I loved listening to the story... I could almost hear John Green himself in the speed and wit of the dialogue. I thought the story was so ingenious in the way it pulled you into scenes of funny conversation, then swiftly and unexpectedly delivered emotional gut punches that left you breathless. The last 30 or so had me crying big, fat, ugly, heartfelt tears and I honestly didnt stop until the last word was read, carrying the heaviness in my heart for the remainder of the day and even still. Its a beautiful story of love and life and figuring out how to work with the cruel hand some are inexplicably dealt. As I mentioned above, the book is deserving of all the accolades it has received and I anxiously await the movie next summer. This moving book solidly earns 6 stars from me. Im in love with you, and Im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. Im in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have, and I am in love with you.

Shahrzad is a difficult girl, and I am a monster. I suppose that makes for a good match. I often know that I am, at one point or another, going to read a certain book. Sometimes it may take months and even years, but in the end, I still get around to doing it. Such is the case with The Wrath and the Dawn. It has been on my shelf since forever and I have always known that I would love it. If I actually sat down and read it. Same was the case with Six of Crows and An Ember in the Ashes. And, in all honesty, I was right. I absolutely loved all of these books. My main problem with actually dedicating time to The Wrath and the Dawn was that I just didnt want to approach it at the wrong moment. I know I have said this before, but timing is really important, especially when you have some information about a certain read and you, kind of, know what to expect. So, I am glad I was postponing reading this book until now. In a sense, had I forced myself to read it before, maybe I would not have enjoyed it as much as I did now. The story is, as I am sure everyone knows, based on Arabian Nights, which is a particular favourite of mine. It begins with an enraged and determined Shahrzad, who has volunteered to become the next bride of a Caliph, who is famous for killing his wives on the morning. Her motivation comes from the fact that he has just killed her best friend and this has left Shazi in a position, where she has to seek revenge. An aspect, which was definitely missing, and which has a predominant importance in the original, were the stories. There were two stories told in this book and on one hand, thats a good thing. It means we are shifting away from the original and exploring new horizons. On the other hand, I felt a bit cheater, since I was expecting entertaining stories, which in turn would make Khalid the Caliph interested in Shahrzad. Which brings me to the other aspect, which bugged me continuously. The relationship between Shazi and Khalid was suffering, in my humble opinion, from the instalove curse. Honestly, I did not see how the deep hatred and prejudice she had for him turned into love. I get it that sometimes people are unexplainably drawn to each other, theres lust, which more often than not, does not entail love. However, here everything happened so quickly that I just wasnt convinced. Khalids disinterest disappeared after one day and Shazis hatred dissolved after a few weeks. And on top of it all, their interactions were not that frequent...I mean, she narrated a total of one story, which pretty much sums up their time alone before they fell in love. At around 30 in, they had already fallen for each other. Now, for me, this was a problem and an illogical handling of the situation  the situation where it was obvious they were meant to love each other, otherwise there would have been no story. There is a prominent lack of an antagonist in the story up until the very end. We are pretty sure we are dealing with a curse, which is the reason for the killings, however that is not a strong antagonist. If it is one at all. At the beginning we are told Khalid is the monster, the killer, however I think after he and Shahrzad fell in love, it is not credible to think him as the bad guy. Still, these were pretty much my only problems with this story. If we ignore the quick development of the protagonists relationship, I can wholeheartedly say this was an amazing story. It is quite heavy on the romance part, however, I think everyone whos started it, should have already known that. For me, this was a plus since I was in the mood for a romantic fantasy. The characters were definitely one of the strongest elements of this story. They were all extremely well fleshed out and their portrayals were individual in the sense that they immediately got assigned a certain personality, that you could track until the end. On the other hand, this made them a little predictable. However, it is immensely more difficult to make predictable characters interesting. And these characters were interesting. They made me sympathize with them, they made me care for them even though I knew how they were going to react most of the times. For this, I really applaud the author. Another great aspect of the book was the writing, which was effortlessly beautiful without being overburdened. Renee Ahdieh really has a gift. There were so many moments when I just read and reread certain passages for the sheer beauty of the language. And again, all was effortlessly done in a way that was not imposing. There are a lot of authors there is one in particular I am thinking of at the moment, who make it their goal to write in a ridiculously descriptive way, using a ton of metaphors and epithets, hoping this would deceive the reader they are gifted writers. Some authors, dont really need that. I am placing Renee Ahdieh next to Laini Taylor in my imaginary ranking of writers, who have the best use of language. Even though there were a lot of things I didnt like, I realized I didnt like them only when I sat down and started writing this review. For when I was actually reading, I raced through the whole book, it gripped me and didnt let go. Thats how addicting it was. So really, all the negative aspects I listed came to me in retrospect, which probably means they are not much for a problem for the overall read. All in all, I can say, this was an incredibly enjoyable read and I absolutely am going to read the second, and final, part. Endnote: As always, positive reviews are so much harder to write than the negative ones...
3 out of 5 stars to Hidden Bodies, the second book in a thriller and suspense series by Caroline Kepnes. Last month, my buddy Medhat suggested a read of You, the first novel in the series. It was such a fantastic book, probably in my top 2 of 2017 to date, that I had to continue reading the series. Ive heard rumors there will be a third book, but Ive yet to see it confirmed. I need to check on that! I am also completely excited as Lifetime is turning the books into a television series. I cant wait... but until then, lets get on with the review of this second book. While I enjoyed several parts of it, it doesnt hold a candle to the first book and Ill explain why below. Plot, Characters  Setting When we left off at the end of You, our protagonistvillain, Joe, completed his vicious cycle of crossing many lines and breaking tons of laws in NYC all in the name of love, also known to most people as stalking your prey. Yet he escaped without anyone knowing of his crimes and found himself falling in love with a new potential victim, Amy Adam. Joe begins trusting Amy, realizing shes a muchimproved version of his last girlfriend, Beck. Amy begins pushing him for a key to his bookstore, which we all know from reading the first book contains a few secrets Joe would prefer stay buried, like some bodies. He hides everything as much as he possibly can, caving in to his girlfriend in order to hold on to her. When he arrives for work a few days later, the place has been robbed and Amy is missing. Did she do it? Was she kidnapped as payback for his prior crimes? What does she know? Youll find out... he finds a lead that shows she may be in Los Angeles. Joe quits his job and moves crosscountry, where he meets an interesting cast of characters in his typical LA apartment. He negotiatesmanipulates his way into working closely with a few Hollywood type agents and producers, finding himself falling in love with a new woman, coincidentally named Love. Love is perfect for Joe. She adores him. And he soon forgets about Amy. All seems well for a short period of time. But he keeps worrying about the one piece of evidence of his former crimes back in Rhode Island... and it drives him nearly insane, especially when the case is reopened. He knows he has to find a way to retrieve it without anyone seeing him in the victims house. Unfortunately, hes distracted by Delilah, one of the women in his apartment complex who has the hots for him. And then theres a cop who has taken a dislike to Joe, tailing him at different parts of the day while Joe is trying to tie up loose ends. But its when Loves exboyfriend and her brother monopolize all of Loves time, Joe goes off the rails. As he begins to unwind, adding more and more crimes to his list in order to cover up the past and protect himself from losing Love, Joe finds himself getting careless. It all comes crashing down in the last few chapters of the book, ending at a place where its very clear, a third book is necessary. Readers will not be OK with this ending, as it opens more holes than the ones Joes already had to dig for each of his hidden bodies. Approach  Style Whereas in the first book, Joe talks to the readers almost as if they are Beck, its quite different in this second book. Its still told in first person with the perspective only on Joe throughout the whole story; however, theres no concept of you this time around. It works just as well, given the title is no longer You, which means alternative progression is an expected path. I read a largesized softcover book with 430 pages. There are 56 chapters, so each one is less than 8 pages long on average. It took me 4 days over the course of a week, as I couldnt read each day; in total, probably about 6 hours. Some sections are a bit slowpaced while others are ultimate pageturners where you probably skip every fifth word just to see more quickly whats happening. Strengths Kepnes can certainly dream up extremely aggravating and realistic characters. Everyone she incorporates feels like someone Ive met before, and at times, I wish I could be Joe and punish them for the things they say and do. But Im a good guy and I dont commit many crimes. I mean any crimes. When shes on point with a dramatic scene, the plot and action is amazing. A few scenes were just as good as the initial book, especially when Joe is dealing with Delilah and the cop. Its almost like we never left the first book. Love is a really multidimensional woman; she has moments of brilliance followed by sheer silliness. I want her to be with Joe, but sometimes, she seems too good for him. The settings are crystal clear for the most part. I can always tell where we are and whether its gonna be a safe zone or all hands to the battle field. Concerns It was such a letdown from the first book. Joe became weak. I didnt buy his drama. He seemed to cause problems for the sake of causing problems. He had the girl. But he let himself get caught up in other areas, ones that made him a true criminal and not a man in love. Thats where he becomes a bad stalker. In the first book, he loved the girl so much, you could see why he did the things he did. This time, I struggled connecting with his motivation. He became every other evil antagonist, rather than the guy you wanted to root for. The ending gets closer to the original strength, but not all the way. I was pleasantly surprised when the last 100 or so pages took the story in quite a different and unexpected direction, but it wasnt enough to turn the book around for me. If this were the only book I read, and I didnt know much about the original plot, it wouldnt have been a book Id recommend to friends. And thats sad because Joe is an amazing villain. I toyed with giving this less than 3 stars but I know that is mostly the disappointment in ruining a good character. Its redeemable in a third book, so I will have faith things get better. Final Thoughts The story is still good. Its got major problems with his constant quest for sex, which is just an overused plot component in this book. Pull that out. Take out the section where he turns into a whiny mess. And maybe give him a few more close calls, and were back in the game.

This was done as a joint review with Lisa at Lost in Lit After reading Me Before You, I was pretty wrecked. This book was so emotional, beautiful and very thought provoking. Lisa and I decided that a traditional review was not fitting for this book and decided to change things up a bit! Me Before You is really about the characters and their story, so we would like to share a little about what these characters taught us. The Five Things that Becca learned from Will  There are going to be things that happen in your life that are going to change you as a person forever. It is up to you to decide who you are going to be after. Before his accident Will had a wonderful life that he loved. He was successful, in a happy relationship and lived his life to the fullest. He traveled all over the World to experience all different things. After his accident, his entire life changed and he became a shell of the person that he used to be. He was angry, depressed and pushed everyone away from him. You think that you know... but you have no idea. While reading Me Before You, I was able to really see into the life of a disabled person, and not just them, their family and their loved ones as well. By the end I realized, that all of the pain and sorrow I felt for Will and his family and all of the anger, depression and helplessness I felt emanating from Will... is very little in comparison to what he must go through on a daily basis. So while I feel that I can empathize and understand, I really have no idea how a disabled person suffers. I do not even feel that his family or loved ones could truly understand what he was going through. Sometimes, even when its unexpected, people have a way of surprising you. From the moment that Will meets Louisa, he seems to think that he has her figured out. Yet time after time, she surprises him. From their first meeting up until the very end, she was so unpredictable and fascinating. I loved seeing her change through his eyes and I loved how she seemed to open him up and let us see the real Will hiding inside. Love can come into your life at an unexpected time and heal you. Me Before You was not a romance in the traditional sense, but a very beautiful relationship does develop between Lou and Will. They really learn so much from one another and bring out all of the others best qualities when they are together. Even with the darkness that Will was surrounded by, Louisa brought this light into his life. Despite some pretty terrible attempts, she made him smile and enjoy life again and it was so beautiful and inspiring. Your Life is your own to live, and no one else can tell you how to live it. Will had to live through so much pain and suffering, not only was his life changed forever by his accident, but he felt as though he no longer had control of it. For a man so stubborn and full of pride, this made his life miserable. His disability ruled his life and all of the people he was surrounded by felt as though they knew what was best for him. Although they did it out of love, what he really needed was someone to give him choices and stand by him on even his worst days. We all hope to have a Lou in our lives, someone to brighten up the dark days and stand by our side. I am blessed enough to have an amazing husband by my side, and I know he will be there for me through anything, just like I will be for him. Five Things that Lisa learned from Lou  Never settle for a love that is less than you deserve. Way too often, we find ourselves settling for a relationship because we think its better than being alone. Lou was in a relationship with Patrick, who was a comfortable choice... yet she realized after a while that she wasnt truly in love with him. It tough to break off a relationship when the fear of being alone is so strong. Lou struggled with her feelings for Patrick for quite a while. Never stay in a relationship that youre not happy in. Life is too short, and we all deserve to be happy. Compassion and empathy are priceless. This is something I personally strive for on an everyday basis, so I loved how strongly that message was portrayed in this story. Sympathy is often frowned upon. People dont want you to feel badly for them. No one likes that feeling. But having compassion and empathy for what others are going through can really help a person through their difficult times, as well as help you to understand others on a deeper level. The compassion and empathy Lou showed Will right from the start is how every person should strive to be. You can never truly understand what a person is suffering with, no matter how hard you try. This has to do with a disability, a mental illness, or even a tragic event. Unless you are in the persons head, you have no idea what they are going through. Everyone deals with pain differently. Just because you may have had a more tragic event, may be more sick, or may feel that your situation is much worse for whatever reason, the fact that you feel your tragedy iswas worse doesnt make theirs any less devastating to them. Lou struggled to understand Will and how he felt living with his disability. Its something thats almost impossible to understand on any real level. Never judge others until youve lived a day in their shoes. This is almost impossible in most situations... so just dont judge. Judging someone elses life choices does absolutely no good. People are so quick to judge, so quick to question others motives and why they act the way they do. You dont know what others are going through. Youre not in their head. So give them a break and stop judging their every move. I was so impressed with the lack of judgmental thoughts on the part of Lou. Will was a tough character to handle at times... and the way Lou handled his mood swings, bad decisions and the way he went about certain aspects of his life really left a lasting impression on me. Im not sure that I could have been as understanding and supportive as Lou was. Live the best life you can, one that you can be proud of. For the most part, you have zero say in how your life is going to turn out. You can plan all you want... but life takes twists and turns that are completely unexpected, and we often find ourselves going down a path we never planned on taking. What I learned is you have to just go with it. Take the punches with a grain of salt and keep moving forward. Dont let the fact that life isnt going the way you had planned hold you back from making it all that you want it to be. Aim to make every day a wonderful day, and live the life that you want, regardless of the circumstances. Make the best of every situation, and live life to the fullest. Live your life the best way you can, and be proud of it. Lous life took a few turns, some more major than others, and the way she refused to pout about it, but instead just figured out what to do next was admirable. I cant imagine how she felt dealing with some of the stuff she did, so I give her so much credit for handling things the way she did.
 spoiler alert  Hello Everyone! This review was originally posted my blog, We Are On the Same Page. Here is the link: When Passenger first came out in January of 2016, I was so excited for it! I got it on the day that it came out and I had all the intention in the world to read it right as I put it on my shelf. I adore Alexandra Bracken and The Darkest Minds is still one of my favorite series, so I was confident that I was going to read this book the moment I got my hands on it. And then life hit me like a bullet train going a million miles an hour. By that I mean that this book came out at the beginning of my last semester of high school and a month before our production of a Sound of Music was going to open. These two things alone would have been enough to keep this book unread for a little longer but then the lovely universe decided that it was going to bless me with a reading slump the very moment that I started to have time to even think about picking this book up. All of this is to say that Passenger has been sitting on my shelf for a year now and I just got around to reading it. This. Was. A. Mistake. Holy moly this book was good. Lets start with the world building. I havent read many time travel books but I know that it takes a lot to make a time travel book work. Each author has to come up with their own time traveling system, with its own rules and regulations, and then they have to create a plot that doesnt abuse the fact that the novel has time travel. I dont want to feel like the author didnt have a way to make their book work and so they threw time travel into it in hopes of fixing their problems. I dont want it to be SO convenient that you know exactly what is going to happen to all the characters, or there is no peril because everything can be undone by time travel. I also dont want to be told what is going to happen by someone who came back from the future to meet our protagonists in the present, and then just watch the plot unfold in exactly the way that character described. Basically, time travel is very difficult to pull off but Alexandra Bracken did it flawlessly. Every time that Nickolas and Edda landed in a new place, it was believable. From deserts, to cities, to a giant sailing ship in colonial times, I was engrossed in every environment that was established. The best part for me was that not only was every location interesting, but every environment was necessary. It wasnt like Alex was sitting at her computer and decided, I really like desert tombs so lets go to a desert! It was easy to follow where the characters where at all times, what the society and culture was like, what part of the mission needed to be conquered and how quickly Nickolas and Edda needed to move. Secondly, the characters. I will have to admit that there was just a tad too much romance in Passenger for my taste. I am really not that big of a fan of romance, and this book was pretty much centered around one. There was a little bit of instalove at the beginning that I wasnt a huge fan of either. However, I did like how naturally Nickolas and Edda grew together. I enjoyed that Nickolas was thinking about turning the astrolabe over to Ironwood even though he was in love with Edda. It felt like he had no other choice. It wasnt all sunshine and rainbows for their relationship. I also like that they argued a lot throughout the book. It made sure that they had real, unique and understandable concerns that needed to be addresses if they were going to continue their relationship or survive. I also enjoyed all of the side characters. Young Rose was a total badass. Young Alice felt like someone that I wanted to spend ages with and was an old friend. Sophia was understandably driven by her desire to make a difference and mean something in a society, in a time, that didnt let her achieve much of anything. Ironwood was evil and made me feel unsettled whenever I was reading about him. One of my favorite things about Alexs books are her characters. I was nervous that I wouldnt fall as in love with this new crew of characters, because I absolutely adore Ruby and the gang. However, I found myself loving Nickolas and Edda in a different way. Ruby, Pudge, Zu and Liam felt like the perfect gang of friend that banded together to make a family. Nickolas and Edda felt like long lost loves that would fight for each other across time and space. Each cast of characters is fantastic in their own right and I ended up loving them both. Lastly, this book has a powerful impact. It discusses a lot of subject that you would not expect from a time traveling YA novel. Alex conquers themes of race, gender, class, identity and love with grace and ease. She didnt write a novel and then thought, I need some really deep and pertinent themes in my book! It makes sense that Sophia would yearn for a time where women could walk the streets on their own and vote. It makes sense that Nickolas would yearn for a time where interracial couples werent hunted, where slavery didnt run rampant and where he could own his own ship if he wanted to. However, Alex also manages to acknowledge that our time isnt perfect. Racial struggles and prejudices are still rampant. Women still arent treated equally. Society is still struggling with unity, social restrictions and what identity means for millions of people who live in the melting pot we call the world. I didnt expect any of these themes to be covered, but I am excited that they were and that they were executed skillfully. Overall, this book did not let me down. It was a wild, fun and exciting ride that left me wanting more. I cant wait to jump right into Wayfarer one upside of waiting so long was that I dont have to wait a year for the next book and see how Alex can wrap this adventure up. If you love historical fiction, romance, deeper topics that are handled really well, diversity and action, then I encourage you to pick up Passenger or take it off of your shelf and give it a read. You wont be disappointed. Overall: 5 out of 5 stars 93 out of 100
See more of my reviews at my blog! I admit it, I have avoided writing a review for Clockwork Princess. I wasnt even sure I could write a coherent review because this book made me so emotional. Yes, I cried around a thousand times while reading Clockwork Princess, I am not ashamed to admit it. There are no spoilers in this review for any of Cassandra Clares books. Immediately once I started Clockwork Princess, I couldnt stop reading. I was up late into the night reading this book because it was that spectacular. I have gotta say that this Cassandra Clares best book to date. I have read and loved all of her books but none of her books have made me this emotional. City of Lost Souls conclusion is emotional but Clockwork Princess broke my heart a thousand times There were tons of memorable quotes in this book and I decided to put a postit every single time there was quote I liked on a page. Needless to say my book was littered with postits all over. I had to stop using so many postits because I started to run out of postits so quickly. Im going to post some of my favorite quotes: You know that feeling, she said, when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing tight around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage and you cannot let go or turn the course aside. His blue eyes were dark with understanding  of course Will would understand  and she hurried on. I feel now as if the same is happening, only not to characters on a page but to my own beloved friends and companions. I do not want to sit by while tragedy comes for us. I would turn it aside, only I struggle to discover how that might be done. Heroes endure because we need them. Not for their own sakes. Our hearts they need a mirror, Tessa. We see our better selves in the eyes of those that love us. We are not our parents, Gabriel. We do not have to carry the burden of their choices or their sins. Do not regret too much you have made in the past...Only make the right ones in the future. We are ever capable of change and ever capable of being our better selves. Those are my top five spoilerfree quotes. Clockwork Princess is not about who Tessa falls in love with. It in a way its Tessas comingofage story because Tessa finally comes to terms with who she is as a person. Sure I loved the love triangle segment of this book but I also loved seeing Tessa evolve. Tessa isnt the same girl that we met in Clockwork Angel. Tessa is now much more comfortable in her own skin and shes alot more mature. Tessa is now one of my alltime favorite characters. I swear I cried around a thousand or so times during this book. I mentioned it before I thought I would repeat myself for emphasis. As far I remember, only 3 books have ever made me cry The Book Thief, Prodigy, and now Clockwork Princess. I dont usually get so emotional while reading but I couldnt help myself. I couldnt keep calm while reading because I am so emotionally attached to all the characters. I cried for characters I never really liked too much, thats how much of an emotional wreck I was. I have already been told that it was unmanly. Why is showing emotion considered unmanly to show emotion. Anyway I dont care what haters say because this is Clockwork Princess and I am never changing who I am. Anyway the more I read, the more I couldnt stop crying. I seriously need to get a grip on myself and the more I tried not to cry, I cried even more. This book will make an emotionless zombie into a heartbroken fool who will cry a river. I wouldnt lie about that. Theres no way I can express my love for this book or Clares book without getting all ranty. The writing in this book is simply superb and its definitely her best yet. Never have I read a more perfect and fitting end to a series, everything is perfectly resolved. Theres so many ways I could describe the ending of this book: powerful, emotional, touching, sweet, and so on. I had just had so many feelings while reading this book that there came a point where happy and sad were basically the same thing. I just wanted Tessa, Jem, and Will to be happy. Youd have to be heartless not to shed at least one tear while reading this book. You dont have to be ashamed of it! I think there needs to be a support group for this book because I was emotionally torn apart while reading this book. One quote from Clockwork Angel and Clockwork Princess perfectly sums up all my feelings for One must always be careful of books, said Tessa, and what is inside them, for words have the power to change us. and You know that feeling, she said, when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing tight around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage and you cannot let go or turn the course aside. This one powerful and emotionally moving novel, I cant stress that enough. There is so much going on Clockwork Princess yet the plot is executed wonderfully. I loved the whole plotline with Henry and Charlotte. The relationship between Charlotte and Henry was just so sweet and touching. Everything is tied up neatly at the end and anything you could think of is resolved. Basically Im obsessed with Clockwork Princess and I cant say anything bad about this book. If theres anything I want to come out of this review with, I want you to read Clockwork Princess. Cast aside, everything in your life but this book, nothing else matters. I promise youll thank me later. There has never been a better love triangle ever written and there certainly has never been a love triangle executed this well. Clockwork Princess left me completely and utterly speechless. This book is just simply brilliant.
For more reviews and giveaways, go to  This is far too accurate! This review is, I truly believe, the hardest review I have had to write on the blog so far. How do I even begin to express all my feelings about this book? This is where I know that whatever I say will in no way truly explain the amazing, the exceptional, the heartbreaking thing that is We Were Liars. I just dont have the writing talent that Lockhart does, Im not going to be able to do her book any justice in this review. But I am certainly going to try and I am going to hope that it leads you to pick up this book and experience it for yourself. The summary of the book is one of the greatest I have seen in a long while. Its very intriguing and it piqued my interest straight away. Then I saw all the love pouring in for this book and I knew I had to hurry up and get to me eARC of it. That one line: And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.  that is beyond accurate because this has an end that you just dont want to spoil for anyone. I didnt know what to expect from We Were Liars, but it delivered everything I could have wanted and so much more. It earned a place among my favourites, a place among the list of books that has made me sob and became the first book to ever make me cry whilst reading on my lunch break at work. This was ugly crying, this was the kind of crying that made me 5 minutes late back from my break because I had to get my crying under control. I didnt know what to expect from We Were Liars, but I honestly didnt expect that. This packed a definite punch, it was gutwrenching and heartbreaking and I hated it but couldnt stop myself from loving it. Our narrator is Cadence Sinclair Eastman, the first grandchild of Harris and Tipper Sinclair, and heiress to the Sinclair family fortune. The Sinclair family are old money, they own their own private island and I might just be completely in love with them. They provide everything you need in a book; intrigue, love, mystery, drama and everything in between. Cadence looks back on her summers on Beechwood Island, which she spends with her family, including the Liars. The Liars consist of Cady, her cousins, Johnny and Mirren, and Gat, the nephew of her aunts boyfriend. And I enjoyed every second of getting to know them all and finding out about their summers on the island. Cady was a brilliant narrator for me because I couldnt trust her. This book is about discovering what happened during summer 15. This is where Cady suffered a traumatic head injury and washed up on the beach, where she was discovered by her mother. She has no recollection of what happened, why she was swimming in the sea in nothing but her underwear, or why her family refuse to talk to her about it. After she misses summer 16 on the island, Cady is determined to go back this summer, summer 17, and find out what happened to her that year. The mystery aspect of this book was perfection. You were as completely out of the loop as Cady was, you feel as completely lost as she does and it makes it so easy to sympathise with her. Her family arent telling her the whole truth and shes suffering daily pain that makes her almost wish she were dead. All she wants to do is uncover the truth and find out what happened that summer. I was just as desperate to find out as she was because I knew it was going to be something big. Cady and Gats relationship develops slowly as they spend their summers together on the island. I thought Gat was a hilarious character, but a very complex one as well. He spends his summers with them but doesnt feel an accepted part of the Sinclair family. Cadys grandfather does not accept him, or the fact that he and his uncle are both Indian and this bigotry begins to have a big impact on Gat as he gets older. He was hurting and he was an easy character to feel for, I really felt for him and the fact that no one else seemed to notice the treatment he was receiving. I loved and laughed at his hilarious one liners and moments like this, which he writes in a note to Cady: Someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments. I get the same thing spending an hour with you. Also, here is a green toothbrush tied in a ribbon. It expresses my feelings inadequately. Sweet and funny, how could I not just fall in love with that boy? Lockharts writing was exceptional and its made me ache to get my hands on more of her books. She writes in such a beautiful way, her writing was something I had to get used to. I had a moment of reading where I stopped and put the book down because of how shocked I was about what had just happened. After a second of collecting myself, I picked the book up again and realised what I had read was a metaphor and Id had a heartstopping moment over nothing. This occurred a lot for me in the book, but soon you get used to it and I loved this style of writing. I honestly couldnt put the book down, I could read this book on repeat for a week and be just as in love with it. Me after the big reveal. I didnt see it coming, I just didnt. I had no idea what I was expecting to be the big reveal about summer fifteen, but I was ill prepared for the truth. It was heartwrenching but exquisitely done. I wanted to start back at the beginning of the book and look for any hint or clue about what was to come. I still do, its only the fact I am behind on my ARCs that has stopped me doing just that. I loved this book and hated it for what it did to me. Its been a long time since a book made me cry out in utter shock, but this did it. I cried like a child whilst on my lunch at work, and I had to go back late because I needed to collect myself. Was it the end I wanted? Hell no. Was it utterly amazing and exceptional in every way? Hell yes! Look at that, Ive wrote an essay length review of this book and been absolutely unable to express how I feel. I have been unable to show how truly amazing I found every minute of this book. Ive been unable to put across my absolute heartbreak from the moment this book utterly crushed me and made me sob like a baby at work. I havent even covered everything I wanted to cover, need to cover and thats just because I cant. As hard as I try, I honestly cant seem to put into words every little thing I love about this book. 55 Butterflies More like 5 Butterflies. I adored this book, hated what it did to me and loved it regardless. My interest never waned and I fell in love with Lockharts writing style. This is one of the best books I have read and I know I will be reading it again. This book and the reading experience will stay with me for a long time, this is a book I will be forcing upon others and begging them to read. The mystery aspect was perfect, I saw nothing coming and I loved how in the dark I was to what was going to happen. I am in awe of Lockharts story, her talent, her writing. I know I have done this book no justice, but I beg you to give it a go and experience it for yourself.
NO SPOILERS. NO TE PREOCUPES. Bodies could be beacons, too, Saul knew. A lighthouse was a fixed beacon for a fixed purpose; a person was a moving one. But people still emanated light in their way, still shone across the miles as a warning, an invitation, or even just a static signal. People opened up so they became a brightness, or they went dark. They turned their light inward sometimes, so you couldnt see it, because they had no other choice. The final exploration of Area X. After the catastrophic and horrifying events that took place in Authority, this ragtag group of individuals is not really an expedition, but a patchwork mashup of survivors trying to make sense of the feral, mysterious, blossoming explosion of nature called Area X. To recap: Area X is a large area of coast and swampland in Florida that is completely cutoff from humanity. Vines grow over everything, the ocean teams with fish, and the land is overflowing with an abundance of animals  some familiar, and some never seen before by human eyes. When the border went up, 30 years ago  1,500 people died or were never seen again and assumed dead as they were consumed by this sudden apparition of wilderness. Now, the government has been sending in expeditions composed of teams of scientists in a desperate attempt to understand whats going on. Those expeditions have been massive failures. The teams either kill themselves, kill each other, disappear, or come back  as personalityless, hollow shells of their former selves. One notable expedition came back riddled with cancer  all of them died within 6 months of coming back. No one knows how anyone returns  they just appear, disoriented and confused. ... This book is, I believe, the weakest of the trilogy. Annihilation is the strongest. You can read Annihilation and enjoy it, love it, and never read the other two books. It can stand on its own two feet. But if you want answers like I did you will continue reading  because Annihilation sure leaves you with a lot of questions. That being said, I still think Acceptance deserves five stars. ... The writing is gorgeous. She had panicked for a second as the water pressed in on her, evoked her own drowning. But then something had turned on, or had come back, and raging against her own death, she had exulted in the sensation of the sea, welcomed having to fight her way to the surface  bursting through such a joyful hysteria of biomass  as a sort of proof that she was not , that she was some new thing that could, wanting to survive, cast out her fear of drowning belonging to another.   characters name xed out so no spoilers Look at this. bursting through such a joyful hysteria of biomass. I mean, that is just exquisite. And the book is brimming with wonderful amazing sentences and paragraphs that you can get lost in. I read the book twice: I read it, and then turned to page 1 immediately to read it again. Half of this was because it was so beautiful, half of it was because there are a lot of complex things going on in this book that need a second reading to really coalesce in your mind. ... This book is a horror story. Not horror as in Stephen King, buckets of blood and possessed cars and stuff. Not dissing him, Im a King fan  but its a different kind of scary. Horror as in slow, creeping insanity, doppelgangers, hearing strange noises in the kitchen at night, etc. etc. etc. Theres no villain, theres no tangible enemy of any kind. Thats what makes it so frightening. Some of the stupider characters in the book just cant seem to grasp that you cant fight Area X with guns and bullets  in fact, you cant fight it at all. Its as pointless as raging against the ocean or the sky. Z had walked into the light to find Y staring at her with fear, with suspicion, and she had smiled at Y, had told her not to be afraid. Not to be afraid. Why be afraid of what you could not prevent? Did not want to prevent. Were they not evidence of survival? Were they not evidence of some kind? Both of them. There was nothing to warn anyone about. The world went on, even as it fell apart, changed irrevocably, became something strange and different. Z and Y used in place of actual character names. ... Its also sciencefiction. Ive heard it described as clifi, as in science fiction with a slant on were destroying our planet, a la Paolo Bacigalupi, but I hate this term. It makes a reader think that this is going to be preachy or selfrighteous and that is not at all what this trilogy is like. It is fun, exciting, and edgeofyourseat reading. I didnt find it the least bit sanctimonious. So read on with no fear! Except, perhaps, the fear that comes with reading any horror novel. ... Some of the reasons I think this is the weakest entry in the trilogy: We are in a lot of peoples heads. Four different main characters in this one, and we get all their points of view. Three in thirdperson and one in secondperson which is fun. I like secondperson when its done well. However, being involved in so many different POVs is adding a bit of complexity to an already very complex book. This is one reason I suggest reading it twice. Another thing is that the first half of the book is not that exciting, not that scary. VanderMeer doesnt really start delivering the blows until page 193. From then on its a fasterpaced freefall into awesomeness, but you do have to get through that first half to reach this. ITS WORTH IT. And the first half is not a slog  far from it. VanderMeers writing is beautiful and you are also, by this point, familiar with  and curious about  the characters so that you are interested in seeing them and getting to know them better. But still, fair warning. Dont get fed up with the lack of action and quit early. ... Theres some great twists in here, and I was happy with the way everything turned up. Even though VanderMeer is not superexplicit, I feel like I have a pretty firm understanding of Area X and what it does after closing this book. People who need a very direct, pat explanation and everything spelled out for them ARE NOT going to be happy or satisfied with this trilogy. However, if you want an amazing trilogy with beautiful writing, fascinating and mysterious concepts, OMGOMGOMG horror that will have you riveted  this is the trilogy for you. You are still there for a moment, looking out over the sea toward the lighthouse and the beautiful awful brightness of the world. Before you are nowhere. Before you are everywhere. P.S. VanderMeer also  throughout the whole trilogy does a GREAT and AMAZING job of making characters of all different types: black, white, Latino, Asian, gay, hetero, bisexual  without making it seem glaring. He does this so seamlessly, so effortlessly, that the reader just falls into this. So many authors try to make diverse characters but end up drawing so much attention to their diverseness that its distracting and annoying. Look at this character. Hes Indian. Hes eating chapati. Did I mention hes Indian? He says, Namaste in this one scene. BECAUSE HES INDIAN. I hate this. Authors who do this are missing the whole entire point of making a diverse cast of characters. The idea is not to hammer home how wonderful you are and how progressive you are for having nonwhite, or nonheterosexual characters  its to make having nonwhite and nonheterosexual characters just a normal part of life. Not questioned, not commented upon to excess, not overanalyzed  just existing. VanderMeer pulls this off perfectly. So does Michael J. Martinez, whose The Daedalus Incident I also highly recommend. P.P.S. People closest to nature already tend to survive and even thrive in Area X, unlike people who are wrapped up in cities and humanity and bureaucracy and taking showers and stuff. LOL But seriously, this is why the biologist gets along so splendidly comparatively in Area X than the others. P.P.P.S. Strong women. If you enjoy strong women and female characters who are strong but NOT MarySues, this is the trilogy for you. Multifaceted, a mixture of goodness and malice, playing both the heroes of the piece and the villains, VanderMeer is wonderful in this regard.
Oh, goodness. I am not normally a huge book reader, meaning that I dont often read really big books. Its not that Im against bog books, but I find I end up putting them off and putting them off in favor of smaller books. And then all too often, when I finally get to the big book, I find that it didnt need about 200 pages. Pages that were filled with unnecessary description or useless dialogue. And I find that I would have liked the book much better had it been 200 pages shorter. That was definitely not the case with Winter. Even though it was 820 pages, I loved every moment of it. Now, that may have partly been due to the way I buddy read it. The book is broken up into 5 smaller books and so my friend and I read about one of the smaller books a week. It worked out perfectly and gave the big book an episodic feel that was perfect. But, mainly, the reason I loved every page was due to the fact that Marissa Meyer is just such an amazing writer! She has a perfect blend of adventure and drama and romance, so youre always entertained. Just when one person gets rescued or one couple makes a breakthrough, another person finds themselves in mortal peril or another couple has a misunderstanding. Its perfect! I spent the whole series going, Aw! Oh no! Yay! Holy Cow! Oh no! Aw! Awesome! Watch Out! Oh no!. And there was never a point where I was like, Yeah, yeah, get on with it already. Cinder and Kai: Cinder is probably my favorite of the main heroines. Ive always been a fan of the scrappy youth that grows up with nothing and then learns they are supposed to be great story arc. Because theyve grown up being mistreated and having nothing, they know how important it is to share and treat others well. And those are the exact qualities Cinder has. Throughout the books, she strives to do her best by the people shes trying to help. And she struggles with her fears of inadequacy and inabilities, so she tries harder to be helpful and do the right thing. And I love that about her. Kai, however, was one of my least favorite Heroes. But thats not a character flaw. Its just that, with his position, he had to be proper and the emperor and couldnt be the reckless renegade that crashed the party. I think he did a wonderful job with what he had and his diplomacy often saved the others when nothing else would have. I also appreciated his inner struggles about Cinder in the book Scarlet. He didnt just follow his heart, he first thought through how any actions in regard to Cinder were going affect his kingdom. And he very often made sacrifices of himself for his people, as a leader should. Scarlet and Wolf: I loved the relationship between Scarlet and Wolf. I loved that, once they discovered each other, that was it. Theyd mated for life and nothing was going to change that. However, I think Scarlet was one of my least favorite heroines, though she did redeem herself in this last book. Im not all that big a fan of the hot blooded redhead thing. As I said, though, I liked her much more in Winter and I think thats because of the interactions between her and Winter. They balanced each other out in a really good way. Wolf. My heart broke so many times for Wolf. The amount of heartache that poor boy had to go through is too much for any one person to experience. And I loved that, through it all, he strove to do the right thing. Wolf will always have a special spot in my heart. My one real regret about the end of this story is how Wolf couldnt be put back after they saved the world. I wish they could have undone the last changes they had made to his body so that he could go back to how he was when he first met Scarlet Cress and Thorne: It was so nice to see how Cress grew through the series. When we first meet her in Cress, shes such a child and one given to delusions of grandeur. Of pirates and heroes and princesses and kisses. She sees everything in ideals and has to learn that not everything is how it is in storybooks and her imagination. I also loved that, even though she was scared so much of the time, she still strove to help wherever she could. And her hacking skills are amazing! Thorne was hands down my favorite hero. I loved his swagger and quips and really enjoyed watching him grow from the uber superficial thief, to the hero Cress always thought he was. Winter and Jacin: I loved the heart of Winter. I loved how she had made a decision not to use her gift because of how it could hurt people and then she stuck to her guns and didnt use it. However, I found that her crazy episodes got to be bothersome after a while. Especially when she and Scarlet were supposed to be escaping the castle. I often found that she was a burden, but then it paid off when they had to recruit later on, didnt it? Jacin irritated me a lot too. Hes not much a a team player, is he? I mean, I get that his first priority was Winter and keeping her safe, but sometimes he followed that objective to the detriment of everyone else and I wasnt all that keen on that. His and Winters romance wasnt all that great, either. I mean, I loved that they loved each other, but I was much more a fan of the other three couples, honestly. Levana: What can I say about Levana? She was totally insane and evil and played that part perfectly. Whenever she could do the worst thing imaginable, she usually did, and often with the help of Aimery, who was scary evil. In fairest, we learned some of the reason why Levana is the way she is, but it obviously doesnt excuse the way she is. She had plenty of opportunity to be a better person, but never once took it. Iko and Torin: These two arent a couple, obviously, but they both are minor players that had a big impact on the major players. Iko is probably my favorite character in the whole series. I loved her pluck and sarcasm and enthusiasm. I cheered when Thorne found her a body. I loved how much she cared for Cinder. I just loved her. She was awesome. I really liked Torin a lot too. During Cinder, I was worried that wed find out he was a double agent working for Levana, but Im so glad that he wasnt. He always took great care of Kai and thats to be commended. If they ever make a movie out of this series I think Torin should be played by Hector Elizondo. The Lunar Chronicles is one of my favorite series of all time. I truly loved reading it and can see myself rereading these books in years to come. I will be reading the last story in Stars Above today and then will say goodbye to this great world. I cannot wait until Meyers next book come out!
8717 update: Its past time I gave this a proper review. This is my fifth time through this two on audiobook, so that should say something. Its surprising that I would love this so much since Im largely indifferent to books about social justice, and thats a huge chunk of this story. I will point out that the only part that annoys me is chapter 23 where Atticus flat out preaches on the evils of the justice system, class warfare, a bit of racism, etc. I dont even disagree with him, but its the delivery that irks me. Ill let Bill Cosby explain it. I guess its ironic that hes a black man whos dealing with his own issues with the court system right now, but if you need any proof that weve come a long way since the 1930s, and the 1995 OJ verdict didnt provide ample evidence for you, then the Coss situation should be it. For what hes charged with hed have been tried and fried in about three minutes during the great depression, even in the north. But thats neither here nor there. Tell it, Bill: You got a steak. Just imagine you got a porterhouse and no white lines in it at all. Now, what would you like to go along with it? Crispy potatoes! Now, you got mushrooms. You can smell it, cant you? Smell the potatoes? Smell the mushrooms! Sauteed! MMM, boy! Huh? All right, now, Im going to present it to you, right? But, I dont get a plate. I take the garbage can lid, and I turn it upside down! After taking it off the garbage can, I take your steak, your potatoes, your sauteed mushrooms, and I give it to you! Not too appetizing, is it? Its in the presentation. Thats how she brought you here, on a garbage can lid! And thats just what Harper Lee did with chapter 23. She crescendos along using other literary means throughout the book showing rather than telling, then all of a sudden... IN YO FACE! The mask is ripped off, and all her views on everything are in front of you, stark naked, with Atticus acting as spokesman. He doesnt break the fourth wall since Jem is asking questions, but he might as well have; that section is clearly intended for the readers edification. The moral instruction is more ambiguous in the rest of the book because everything is seen through the eyes of Scout, an innocent child. Even the courtroom scene which contains one of the best speeches Ive ever read gets away with its moralizing due to the nature of the situation, but the living room chat in chapter 23? Not so much. Its just a minor annoyance because the change in tone and technique is a little jarring once I realize whats going on. She starts to sneak it in there, but its easily identifiable rather quickly. But enough about that. This book is still fantastic. I love the setting, and some of the imagery. Its also very well crafted and everything fits together all the way through to the end. A major benefit is that Scouts interpretation of events going on around her makes those events hilarious. The side stories add color no pun intended to an already rich tale. E.g.: The kid who was locked in the furnace room and forgotten during Sunday school telling her eventual rescuers that she didnt want to play Shadrach anymore. Ingenious. From what I understand a lot of these anecdotes are things that actually happened to Harper Lee. I wonder which ones are real and which are complete fiction, but I dont think theres any way to find out for sure. It was neat to find out that the character of Dill was based on Lees reallife childhood friend Truman Capote. He had given Lee the same treatment in his own novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms, and I suppose she was returning the favor. Atticus parenting style is most admirable. Its a shame its fiction, and my attempts to copy it with my own nieces and nephews sometimes fall flat. Well, the kids might still get the point, but it doesnt go anywhere near as smoothly as it does in the book. Course, Im nowhere near as eventempered as Atticus, so that plays a part as well. If I came across a Bob Ewell spitting in my face, Im pretty sure wed rumble. Turning the other cheek is not something I do very well, though I admire people who can manage it. One thing I did appreciate is Atticus compromising his standards at the end of the book when Sheriff Tate convinces him to let the Boo Radley matter lie right where it is. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Tell it, Heck! . As much as I love Atticus, I must confess he lives in a fantasy world. He insists on believing the best of everyone, and his children nearly died because of it. Optimism is great, but not when it causes you to deny reality. If someone tells me hes going to get me, it behooves me to be prepared for the possibility that hes going to try just that. Since Go Set a Watchman has come out, Atticus is now the winner of the most ironic line award when he tells Jem The Ku Kluxs gone, itll never come back. I never paid much attention to this line in previous readings even though I knew Atticus was wrong, but I sure picked up on it this time given what I know about Atticus future. Every time I read this I want to get a copy of a Rover Boys book, and two of the Seckatary Hawkins books, Stoners Boy: A Seckatary Hawkins Mystery and The Gray Ghost: A Seckatary Hawkins Mystery, but theyre a little expensive and I have so many other books I need to read. The Rover Boys are on the Gutenberg Project website since theyre over 100 years old, but reading it on the computer is no fun; I want a real book. Granddaddy had some of them when he was a kid, so they might be at the farm. It would be quite a treat to read those, but they might also be long gone. As for Seckatary Hawkins, Ill bite the bullet on that one day. I want to read them because these are things Jem, Scout, and Dill read. They were also very important to Harper Lee as a child, so important that she sent a signed first edition of To Kill a Mockingbird to Robert Schulkers the Seckatary Hawkins author with an inscription saying how much she enjoyed them. Atticus says Seckatary Hawkins as the author of The Gray Ghost, but it turns out Seckatary is a character in the book. That had me quite confused for a while, but its possible Seckatary was also a pseudonym when these first came out. I understand why literary types love this book because theres a lot of literary stuff in it. Themes, cultural references, etc. I also understand why sensitive types would just as soon it go away because its not for the faint of heart. It tackles some tough issues and a rather ugly side of American history. I think everyone should look at those things from time to time, and this book is a good way of doing that because its so well written. Its a joy to read in spite of its subject matter. Check it out if you think you can handle it. 71915 update: If youre into audiobooks, I strongly suggest the one read by Sissy Spacek; its fantastic. 71510: An excellent book; Ive read it thrice. It gives a fantastic picture of life in the Depression South, and shows how life isnt always fair. Atticus is a great character, though he gets a tad preachy a couple of times towards the end. I love his childrearing style, though, and actually try to emulate it when dealing with my nephew and nieces if they hit me with difficult questions. Another thing about the book is that its very wellwritten with a dry, comic style that kept me engaged. I would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good turn of phrase, and enjoys a good story as well.
This was originally reviewed over at  as a combined review between JC and I. Weve come late to this series, but I think that in itself is a blessing  it meant we could power through all three novels one after the other, never having to wait for the next installment. As such, in some ways its difficult to separate the three into different books as both JC and I read them straight through. Because we both read, and loved, these books, we decided to do a joint post! So youll get both of our thoughts on each of the books in the series. I will say now though, that we are going to do out VERY best not to give any spoilers away for those of you who havent had a chance to read yet. Leigh says: Katniss Everdeen has been dealt blow after blow in her short life, but the first thing you realise is that she is a survivor. You could throw anything at her, and she would come out stronger than ever. But this isnt to say that she is so strong that she doesnt have any weaknesses. She does. And its these weaknesses that are potentially her undoing. J.C. says: I love how vividly she is portrayed. She lives and breathes survival, to the point where she seems to be completely unaware of other things going on around her. Her interpersonal skills are not honed very well, while her huntingsurvival skills are stellar. She is quite self absorbed, which you can see is because she has taken on the role of provider and it consumes all of her energy and time. Leigh says: This book displays a brutal vision of dystopian life and death, family bonds, war, friendship, uprisings, violence, and submissive nations. On one hand, it shows humanitys survival at its finest, and on the other hand  at its worst. There are a lot of storylines weaved into this piece of work, and Suzanne Collins has done this seamlessly to engage the reader. There is something for everyone. This book is no love story, by any stretch of the imagination. She could have drawn undying love into it, but she didnt. She drew in unrequited love and survival. J.C. says: I really appreciated that about the book. There are so many love stories around, and while love is important this book is about life and death. Literally. The stakes are huge and you cant help but get invested in Katniss plight. I love how rich this world is, how fully realized. The world building is fantastic and I could see it all in my mind as I was reading. Leigh says: My favourite part in this book was the building of the friendship with one of the contestants, Rue, in the arena. I loved the connection that they had with each other. The hardest part was knowing that one of them had to die. The gripping part was wondering how it would happen. J.C. says: I loved the friendship between Katniss and Rue as well, it was a beautiful thing. I also really loved the way Katniss and Peetas relationship developed through the book. He was a great contrast in character to her, and they certainly worked the game to their full advantage. When you go into a book like this, you know fairly early on that many of the characters you meet arent going to be alive at the end of the book. As the body count rises, your anxiety level rises as well, and while you are fairly certain that Katniss makes it out alive the book is written in first person, and you know its the beginning of a series, there are some moments where youre holding your breath, waiting to see what the outcome is. Who will be next? How will it happen? As sick as it seems, the voyeuristic nature of humans is apparent  we the reader cant stop reading, and we can kind of relate to the way the Capitol are captivated by the Hunger Games too. Leigh says: Wow, how is that for a premise? A fight to the death. To say that this book is violent is an understatement. It is absolutely horrific. The first thing that struck me about this book is that it is aimed at an age audience of eleven and up. Would I let an eleven year old year old read this? Hell yes. Why? Because this book is written beautifully, has incredible character development, its absolutely riveting, and all the goodness and all the darkness in a broken world. I am a firm believer that children will not read literature that their brain is not ready to absorb and grow from. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time while reading this, and I craved for more. This book rendered me completely antisocial, and when I was actually social  I was talking about the book. There is a lot of narrative humour in this book that you just know a sixteen year old would be thinking, but would never say aloud. It was fabulous. I would recommend this book to everyone, whether they are young or old. If I could give this book more than 5 stars, then I would. Some books are just a really good read, some books change your outlook on life. This is one of those books. J.C. says: Im in much the same boat. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves character and plot strong books. Anyone who wants to escape the real world for a little while because once you start, I highly doubt youll be able to stop reading. It is a brutal read, but a fantastic one.
Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog The Immortal Heights by Sherry Thomas Book Three of The Elemental series Publisher: Bazler  Bray Publication Date: October 13, 2015 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC sent by the publisher Summary from Goodreads: In a pursuit that has spanned continents, Iolanthe, Titus, and their friends have always managed to remain one step ahead of the forces of Atlantis. But now the Bane, the monstrous tyrant who bestrides the entire mage world, has issued his ultimatum: Titus must hand over Iolanthe, or watch as his entire realm is destroyed in a deadly rampage. Running out of time and options, Iolanthe and Titus must act decisively to deliver a final blow to the Bane, ending his reign of terror for good. However, getting to the Bane means accomplishing the impossiblefinding a way to infiltrate his crypt in the deepest recesses of the most ferociously guarded fortress in Atlantis. And everything is only made more difficult when new prophecies come to light, foretelling a doomed effort.... Iolanthe and Titus will put their love and their lives on the line. But will it be enough? What I Liked: Oh. My. Goodness! I MUST reread this series as soon as possible. The Burning Sky is one of my favorite books ever, and The Perilous Sea was an amazing sequel. I absolutely loved The Immortal Heights! This series is perfect! Or as close as it gets. Definitely an alltime favorite series! In this thrilling conclusion novel, Iolanthe and Titus must survive horrible tragedies and terrifying prophecies in order to save the realm and rid Atlantis and the world of the Bane. Titus will never let the Bane get to Iolanthe, but something must give. Sacrifices must be made. Prophecies must be upheld. Secrets must remain covered  until its too late. This book was a whirlwind. It didnt start as a whirlwind see my notes on that below, but it ended with crashes, bangs, and lots of lightning. Sherry Thomas defies expectation  whatever I thought I was in for, I got it, and then some. I have no idea how she crafted such an intricate, exhilarating, creative series! I am quite sure I will not read anything like this, not for a long time. I dont want to get into the specifics of the plot, as this is a conclusion novel. The first half is slow, but necessary. Titus and Iolanthe cross continents, climb mountains, scale towers, to fight to defeat the Bane, and for their love. The second half of the book was INTENSE. I think the switch flipped for me when we learn something irreversible about Iolanthe. At that point, I could not turn the pages fast enough. Oh, Iolanthe. I love her! This book is told in third person, sometimes Iolanthe, sometimes Titus but nothing rigid, like alternating. Iolanthe is clever and capable, determined and stubborn. She never backs down, backs away, and always fights for those she loves. TITUS. Titus holds my heart sorry, Iolanthe. He is so incredibly intelligent, authoritative, polished, talented, fierce, protective. He is the perfect Master of the Domain, prince, friend. He is the one who rules, but he also serves. Its not wonder everyone loves him except maybe the Bane. Titus is clever and intelligent, always with a plan, backup plan, emergency plan. He has a knack for thinking ahead, and a master strategist. He is also quite the swoony hero. He never tries to control Iolanthe, but he is fiercely protective of her, and does everything he can to keep her  and the world  safe. Titus is easily one of my favorite royals in YA lit, one of my favorite heroes, one of my favorite swoony boys. He is so much more than a love interest  hes a prince first. I love seeing so much of the secondary characters we all love, like Kashkari, his soontobe sisterinlaw, Amaram even some unexpected faces. I absolutely adore Kashkari, and I felt bad for him throughout the novel. You have to read the series to know why  I feel for him, and wish he finds happiness! If only... The romance in this book and series is so satisfying! No love triangle, no breakupsmakeupsdrama, just a sweet relationship between Titus and Iolanthe. The two of them are so in love, so devoted to each other, its sweet and tender and sizzly all at once. Props to Sherry Thomas for keeping the romance so simple yet so wonderful. And swoony! As with the first two books, the worldbuilding of this novel is flawless and intriguing. I love the Crucible idea, in which the characters enter a storybook as a means of travel and uncovering secrets. I am totally not explaining this concept well  it is unique and inventive! I could get lost in the world of this series. There are wyverns! The ending of this book is surprising and, like the romance, very satisfying. Youll be worried about certain THINGS throughout this book, but it all comes together in the end. There is plenty of tragedy, but the ending, overall, is very beautiful. I love it! I love this book. Such a fantastic conclusion novel, a great package of seriesending awesomeness. What I Did Not Like: Like Ive said before in this review, the beginning, lets say the first half, was very slow. I was just reading to keep going, see what would happen next. There was absolutely no chance of me DNFing this book, that wasnt an issue. Its just that things didnt really pick up until the second half ish, about when we find out something about Iolanthes future. Something that affected me  I could barely remember what happening in The Perilous Sea! I have The Burning Sky practically memorized, but details for The Perilous Sea elude me. This could have been why I struggled with the beginning of this book? Could be just an Alyssa thing. Would I Recommend It: I recommend this conclusion novel, as well as this series! Definitely an alltime favorite series. If you havent read The Burning Sky, or The Perilous Sea, be sure to fix that as soon as you can. Meanwhile, I am going to be rereading this series. The Burning Sky is still my favorite, but this book and The Perilous Sea are not far behind! Fantasy fans  you NEED this series in your life! Rating: 4.5 stars  rounded down to 4 stars see my notes above. A stunning conclusion to an epic series! With gorgeous covers, too. And a beautiful romance. And a crazy plot. There are so many reasons why you could fall in love with series as much as I did!
Dayyyyum. Consider me impressed. Downright mystified. Bedazzled. Baffled. Bewildered. I have all the synonyms in front of me and believe it or not, they all precisely describe how this book has left me feeling. And then some. My mind has been blown. Because this was, truly, stupendous. You heard me. image error I had no idea what I was getting into. The synopsis I had skimmed before but other than that the only thing that motivated me to read it was that people kept comparing it to Caraval. And may I just ask, why the everloving hell do they do that even? There is only one thing common between the two, just one; the idea of a mysterious traveling circus and that is IT! I enjoyed Caraval, it was unexpectedly fastpaced and easy to read. But for all its efforts to be mysterious and intriguing, save for a couple of twists, the story was rather simple. The infamous Caraval was decidedly nothing too special and gave me strong meh vibes. The Night Circus, on the other hand, was anything but plain. It is intricate, complicated and beautiful. The story has layers upon layers that unravel slowly. The worldbuilding and the plot are complex. I belong to the category of readers where neverending mysteries are abhorred and straight answers are desperately sought out. Which is why it came as a tumultuous surprise when I reveled in how this book moved forward. Things like how the circus works, the nature of the competition between the leads, its inception, its purpose, the question of the origins of magic, these are all essentially fundamental pieces of information upon which the plot rests and are important in understanding how this world works but they are revealed, if they are even, in a less conventional way. This is, beyond question, a mystery book as well as fantasy and the secretive nature is part of the charm. The summary goes like this; Celia Bowen and Marco Alisdair are the disciples of two old magicians who favor opposing methodologies. They occasionally pit their students against each other . These two are bound to each other and must take part in a competition to determine which side is the most enduring . The venue for this challenge is the Night Circus. See what I did there? The things I hid are pivotal in grasping the story and should have been clear from the start. They werent. The answers came extremely late. Even when they did, they were vague at best. And yet, it worked for it added a little more mystique to the ambience, in a good way. I was confused at first about what even was going on, the itch to know everything at once making me impatient. Once it became clear that that wasnt going to happen, I stopped paying it heed. The book maintains its aura of mystery incredibly well and projects an atmosphere which I, as a reader, found captivating. The style in which its written enhances the effect. The narratives alternate between past and future, as well as a few chapters that describe the circus to the readers in present, dispersed with broad intervals in between each, and a characters quotes about the circus. All in third person present tense. The chapter titles mention dates. This, I find enormously annoying because instead of being told about the passage of time you have to keep track of it yourself. I continually turned back to check the dates and figure out how much time had passed and how old the characters were. The characters were all unique and interesting in their own ways. The two competitors, all the circus players and the followers, they made a strange family of sorts and you couldnt help but like each of them. However, there was one person I felt particularly drawn to: Isobel. I liked her more than anyone else and she wasnt even the protagonist. I wanted more about her past, where she came from. There is a single line regarding that and it left me wanting for more. She is also the reason I disliked Marco immensely and that dislike carried throughout the entirety of the book. She deserved better and the way he treated her was despicable. The dislike gave way to indifference where he was involved and I stopped caring about what he did or didnt do. Celia and Marco, and that by the way is NOT a spoiler, turned out to be an inevitable but unrootworthy pair for me. It took forever for them to meet up proper and have a conversation so the love bit seemed less than genuine. Again, it was obviously going to happen but whatever impact it was supposed to have was ruined by the fact that I just didnt like Marco at all. The coupling was the only thing in the book I would have lived happily without. The man in grey suit was an enigma until the very end and if even that much hadnt been told about him, I would have thrown a fit. And redacted a star probably. The role and place of magic in the world of the book was odd and unusual but marvelously written. The Night Circus was extraordinary. It was powerful and moving and spellbinding. My weak heart fell hopelessly in love with it. Secrets have power. And that power diminishes when they are shared, so they are best kept and kept well. Sharing secrets, real secrets, important ones, with even one other person, will change them. Writing them down is worse, because who can tell how many eyes might see them inscribed on paper, no matter how careful you might be with it. So its really best to keep your secrets when you have them, for their own good, as well as yours. 4.55
HERE IS A REVIEW WITH, LIKE, ACTUAL WORDS, I GUESS. spoilerfree Heres something you should know about me: the number of playlists I have for a book is directly related to how much I loved that book. My favorite book, which I read for the first time more than two and a half years ago, has since claimed 182 songs and 15 playlists in my iTunes library. I should mention that some of those playlists and songs go with the sequels, because that is relevant to what Im about to tell you. Six of Crows does not have a sequel yet. I did not read Six of Crows two and a half years ago; I finished it four days ago. It already has 9 playlists and 57 songs. If that does not tell you enough, here are some additional thoughts: Six of Crows is an edgy whirlwind heartbreaker of a book. Its a fantastical, gritty, emotional story about not one, not two, but six threedimensional characters, every one of whom feels like a real person. Its a heist story, a resilience story, and a story about the vanishing line between human and monster. I can already tell you that one of the most popular quotes of the book will be Were all somebodys monster. When everyone knows youre a monster, you neednt waste time doing every monstrous thing. The characters and their relationships were my favorite thing about this novel, but I dont want to say too much about them because I think the experience of getting to know them made me all the more attached. I will say that theyre a bunch of Weebles, you guys. Theyve spent most of their lives wobbling in one way or another, but they refuse to fall down. Two of them are dealing with a betrayal that cost them everything. One of them is hiding severe PTSD after a traumatic and heartbreaking experience. One is tired of always being someone elses property. One is a gambler whose loose lips get him in trouble, and the last is a runaway from a life of privilege and secret pain. There was no part of him that was not broken, that had not healed wrong, and there was no part of him that was not stronger for having been broken. And they have not stopped fighting for what they want, whether its revenge, freedom, love, or acceptance. It turns out that Weebles make for really gripping characters. So, what brings this eclectic cast of people together? Well, Kaz Brekker, of course. Hes assembled this talented crew for business purposes: a man came to see him about an impossible heist that will either get them killed or win them a lifechanging sum of money, and who is Kaz Brekker to turn down a deal like that? The heist has something to do with Grisha and brings about moral debates between some of our characters, but I wont go into detail because the synopsis is similarly vague. I will say its a new side of the Grishaverse, because now were in a part of the world where Grisha are something to be used, not revered or respected. The novel then takes us to another part of the world that believes they are monstrosities, that their existence is wrong and must be corrected. This is the central conflict between two of the protagonists, one of whom is a Grisha and one of whom was conditioned to believe all Grisha are evil, and its a beautiful Jongritteesque situation if I ever saw one. Theres not quite as much magic in this one as there was in any of the original Grisha books, but thats okay because when it is used, its used perfectly. Alina Starkovs journey was, in a way, defined by magic: when she found her magic, she found her power, but losing her magic was ultimately how she kept her power. In Crows, magic and power are inversely linked; characters who have magic must choose how to be powerful despite it, which is a really interesting flip of the dynamic, and I actually think the unconventional approach made for more nuanced character development. Another thing I loved about this book okay, I loved everything, shut up was the strategy behind everything that happened. Kaz is like a male, criminal, slightly more underhanded version of Kestrel from The Winners Curse, so hes always ten steps ahead of everyone else and he uses any information he can get thanks to Inej against someone if he has reason to. He can usually think of a reason to. Kaz cocked his head to one side, his eyes focused on something distant. Scheming face, Jesper whispered to Inej. God, I love him. Kaz is the antihero I think everyone wanted the Darkling to be or is still pretending the Darkling was. I could talk to you about Kaz Brekker for days without interruption. But while he may be the one I feel strongest about, he is by no means the only one who had me basically writhing with emotions. Hence, the playlists. 57 songs in 4 days. You do the math. When I finished the book, I was all and Leigh Bardugo was all So congratulations, Bardugo, you have ruined me. In the best way possible. at least not one I have read because, hi, this book isnt even out for another 5 months. by which I mean, her power over her own life, which is the only kind of power Alina actually wanted and the only kind thats relevant to the main six in Crows.
Reviewed for THC Reviews More than two years after its original release, The Help is still an incredibly popular book. Im not usually quick to jump on the bandwagon of the hot book of the moment, and I might not have even read The Help except that it was chosen as a book club read for the GoodReads Readers Against Prejudice and Racism group to which I belong. Im so glad that it was, because it encouraged me to pick it up. Now that Ive read it, I can say unequivocally that it lived up to the hype and is one of the best books that Ive ever read. The Help is a very empowering story for women, for minorities, for anyone who has ever felt looked down upon for not being good enough. It also carries a strong message about standing up for what you believe in no matter the cost, and pursuing your dreams even when they may seem out of reach. The Help is quite simply a beautiful book that I know will linger in my memory for a long time to come. Having been raised in the midwest and now living in the west, I have to say that Southern culture, especially in the historical context, is something of a curiosity to me. I would expect the rich to have maids, but its interesting that even middle class white families in the South employed black maids. In The Help, the dynamic between these black maids and their white ladies is a richly complex, multilayered dichotomy of love and hate. Some white ladies, like Hilly, were so blinded to their own faults and prejudices that they never change. It angered me when Hilly started pushing her agenda of segregated bathrooms for the household help by acting like the blacks were ridden with diseases, because it was nothing short of ignorance and fear talking. Other white ladies loved their maids like a mother, sister, or best friend, and even if they couldnt overtly admit it due to the deeply seated racism in the South, they showed it through their loyalty. Some of the black maids understandably could hardly stand the white ladies they worked for, and even if they were treated fairly, had often been taught not to get personally involved with them. Still, many of these maids also developed a deep affection for their employers or at the very least their children. These beautiful, heartfelt relationships brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion while reading this book, and yet so could all the horrific, heartbreaking things that were happening in the black community because of hate. Skeeter is a young woman who I could relate to. She thinks of herself as unattractive, because shes taller than most girls, rather plain and has frizzy hair that wont behave, but inside she is full of passion and spirit. Skeeter is very intelligent to the point that I could almost see the wheels turning in her head. Society has told her what she can and cant think, and be, as a woman. She feels like she doesnt have much of a choice in the matter, and yet she longs to break free from that mold to do something bold. Skeeters familys old maid, Constantine, taught her some very valuable lessons about believing in herself that I think in part, fueled her dreams of becoming a writer. Shes searching for that elusive, original idea, and when it comes to her, she tenaciously keeps trying even though it doesnt seem like its going to work out. In spite of being white, she also faces some potential danger and must work on her project in secret. While she covertly writes what is on her heart, Skeeter experiences her first love. Even though her love interest, Stuart, realized that she wasnt like other women, I dont think he ever fully appreciated the precious jewel he had in his grasp. Aibileen is a maid to one of Skeeters best friends, Elizabeth, and she is the first to agree to help Skeeter with her book. Aibileen is a woman who has known hardship and heartbreak, but with the help of her best friend, Minny, she was able to overcome and keep going with life. She is a wonderful, inspiring woman who Id be proud to have as a mother. In fact, she was more of a mother to many of the seventeen white babies she raised than their own mothers were. That includes Elizabeths daughter, Mae Mobley, who Elizabeth largely ignores. It just warmed my heart how Aibileen encouraged Mae Mobley by telling her she was good, and smart, and important when her mother scolded and tore her down. I also loved the secret stories they shared. Aibileen was a very brave woman to not only take part in Skeeters book but recruit others to help too. She was there every step of the way and became a true friend to Skeeter when her other friends abandoned her. Minny is a lady with a hard exterior who can sometime seem abrasive. With five kids and an abusive husband, she has a lot on her plate, but she works hard to take care of her family. Minny has a bit of a temper and a smart mouth that has gotten her in trouble with her employers more then once. Minny was a character who frequently cracked me up. Through a large part of the book, she kept a big smile on my face, because I found her honesty quite refreshing. She certainly doesnt mince words. When she starts working for Celia, its a whole new experience for her. Minny calls her crazy lady, and says she doesnt care about her, but her actions speak louder than words. It was funny how she played along, keeping Celias secret about hiring her, and later it was very touching when she sat with her through a tragedy and kept an even bigger secret. I actually liked Celia and wish that her reasons for keeping so many secrets from a husband who obviously adored her were clearer. I think she just had a case of really low selfesteem, and was desperately in need of a friend, and ultimately, Minny became that friend even though she tried to act like she wasnt. Skeeter, Aibileen and Minny are three characters who I will not soon forget. Throughout the course of the story, they all, in their own way and time, came to the realization that they could take control of their lives and follow their dreams to a better place. These women have three very different personalities and yet I had no trouble relating to each one in turn as the author alternates between their firstperson perspectives. These three ladies touched my heart in a very profound way, to the point that its almost like they actually exist somewhere. Kathryn Stockett has an amazing talent for drawing me into the story and making me really care about each one of them. I truly became invested in what became of them and what life had in store for them. It was rather ingenious how the author sometimes ended a section with a minicliffhanger. It really kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next. The sense of fear surrounding Skeeters project was palpable, as was the the general danger for blacks in the South during the peak of the civil rights era. The authors mention of several reallife events added to the sense of place and time to help make the story come to life. The Help was an amazing book that I cant say enough good things about. In a sea of sameness, this books is a gem of originality. Im astounded that this is Kathryn Stocketts first and only novel to date. I have no idea what she might have planned for the future, but I know for now, it will be hard saying goodbye to Skeeter, Aibileen and Minny. If Ms. Stockett writes anything else for these ladies, or anything else at all, Ill be there to buy it, but in the meantime, it will be difficult to move on to another book after such a wonderful read. The Help is definitely a book that I would recommend to everyone, especially women, and it is a book that without a doubt will be going on my keeper shelf.
My love for this book will never end. This had been my eight time reading The Scorpio Races since it came out. I did not reread it last year, which I very much regret not finding the time for. As this book means everything to me. Its so, so good. Always. If you still havent read this, you are seriously missing out on the best book. I am going to try my best to write down all the reasons for why I love this book so very much. But might also not write too much, because I have already shared so much of my love for this book before. But I cant help it. The Scorpio Races means so much to me. The book is gorgeous. The characters are beyond amazing. This book tells the story of Puck and Sean. They live in this small island in the middle of the sea, which was all kinds of awesome. I loved reading about this gorgeous but brutal place. Im not going to write about the plot of this book, because I want you all to read it instead. So I shall instead just talk about the things that I love. Like the water horses. Because this island isnt only beautiful, its so dangerous too. Especially in the winter. Because that is when the water horses come out of the sea, looking for things to eat. And oh, how I loved reading about these huge and gorgeous and brutal horses. It was, as always, creepy and beyond amazing. I love this book so much, and everything in it is perfection. The writing is gorgeous. And the story is so, so amazing. Always. What I love most about this book is the characters. Its told from the point of view of Puck and Sean. Puck was all kinds of adorable. I loved her so much. Shes fierce and a bit rude yet full of heart. Shes so strong and I simply love how awesome she was. Her parents were killed by one of the horses a year ago, things have been bad for her and her two brothers since then, as they are very short on money. Broke my heart reading about it all again. But its written so well. And they are being so strong about it too. Love them so. I very much loved Pucks younger brother, Finn. He was so special and adorable and just the best. I want to read more and more about him. She also has another older brother, Gabe. And I still do not like Gabe, even after eight times of reading this book. He was selfish and rude. Sure, I can believe that he has his own reasons for what he does, but it is still not an excuse to treat your siblings like he does. And so I just cannot ever forgive him. Hmph. But I am dealing with it. Because Puck and Finn handled it all so so well. And then there was Sean. Sigh. I love this boy beyond words. Hes quiet, yet has the biggest heart. He loves this island, like Puck does too, and they would both never leave it. Sean has been working for this kind of terrible man for years now, ever since his father died. And ahh, this story. It just about killed my heart. Sean just wants his freedom, and Corr, his dangerous but beautiful water horse. But some things are never easy. And there is so much happening, all the time. It was so perfect to read about once again. Im writing all of this all wrong. But having trouble finding the right words for this book. Its impossible to describe it. Its all just so amazing. The story is about how every year on November first, this island has a water horse race called the Scorpio Races. Its a deadly race. And the winner wins a lot of money. Sean needs to win, as he has done four years before, for a very good reason. Puck enters this race for the first time, for family reasons. Except shes racing with her own regular horse. Many does not approve of this. I simply cant write more about this book. I dont know what to say. It just makes me so so happy to read it. To read about Puck and Sean and Corr and Dove. To read about Puck and Sean slowly falling for each other. The romance is not big, but its there, and its beautiful. Reading about everything that happens on this island is so much fun. And heartbreaking too. I love every single moment of this book. Only wish that there were more. There are many great characters in this book. I still hate Mutt. I still love Holly the most. I feel like I have written this review entirely wrong. Probably because I have already written so much about this book before. I simply couldnt find the right words for this book this time. But I tried my best. Either way, I once again loved this book beyond words. And cannot wait to read it again and again. The Scorpio Races truly is a perfect book. Its my favorite book by Maggie. And its her favorite of her books too, which I love so much. Just crossing all my fingers that she will write a sequel to it. I need one badly.  I first read the book from November 23rd to 24th 2011. See my first post here:  I read it for the second time on December 16th 2011. See my post here:  I read it for the fourth time on November 12th 2012. See my post about it here:  I read it for the fifth time on November 1st 2013. See my post here:  I read it for the sixth time from December 3rd to 4th 2014.

Absolutely amazing. An emotional, powerful, piercing and heartfelt story of love and friendship, loss and surviving the difficult side effects of dying. Beautifully written and deserving of all the praise it has garnered, I will never forget the gripping story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. 6 stars.  But it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he has Cassius note, The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars  But in ourselves. There are so many things I LOVED about this book. So many elements... so many big things and subtle things. I loved seeing the witty dialogue come to life through elegant and elaborate syntax. I loved that John Green didnt talk down to his young adult readers, but rather banked on their intelligence, referencing greats like William Carlos Williams and T.S. Eliot the poem mentioned at one point, The Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock is one of my alltime favorites. I loved that he captured the transcendental and deep musings of insightful teenagers, particularly those whom are terminally sick and suddenly find themselves short of time and forced to more seriously ponder the profound and interminable questions that plague their thoughts. And perhaps most significantly, I love that he was able to engender this story that so completely captured my heart, then shattered it into a million little pieces and was nonetheless able to deliver a thoughtful, honest glimpse into painful world of cancerverse. This is a story that is simultaneously complex and simple...we see introspective, esoteric reveries juxtaposed with the irrefutable reality that dying simply sucks. Because there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. There is no honor in dying of. Hazel is dying. 16 years old. Thyroid cancer. Mets in the lungs. She walks around with an oxygen tank and a cannula affixed to her nostrils at all times, helping to deliver air to her lungs that sucked at being lungs. Shes an intelligent, thoughtful girl who challenges the expected cancer platitudes espoused by the nonsick who mean well, but in the end, are only successful in making the sick feel like others. Forced to contemplate the sadness and reality of her imminent demise, as well as of those around her, she questions the usefulness of her cancer support group, where despite challenged to live her best life today, names read off a list of those whom are no longer there, make it clearly evident that you can only cheat death for so long. And its at this support group where she one day meets the boy who would leave his scar on her. My name is Hazel. Augustus Waters was the great satcrossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I wont be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. Gus knew. Gus knows. I will not tell you our love story, becauselike all real love storiesit will die with us, as it should. Augustus Gus Waters lost his right leg to osteosarcoma and is now in remission. Hes a friend of Issac, another friend in the support group who lost an eye at a young age and has recently been told that his other eye must be removed, leaving him to be permanently blind. Augustus is immediately captivated by Hazel and the two form a friendship that was fated to be so much more. Hazel has already survived so much, permanently living in pain, fighting for every breath, every single moment of her life. However, its not the pain that plagues her, its the fear of leaving those she loves behind... leaving them to be shells of who they used to be. Augustus quickly becomes someone she cares about and shes afraid shell leave him wounded in her battle too. I wanted to know that he would be okay if I died. I wanted to not be a grenade, to not be a malevolent force in the lives of people I loved. Their relationship is simply unadulterated beauty. Its so special watching two kindred spirits, two clever quirky people connect so completely. Hazel and Augustus are not strangers to pain, and their individual fears are so real and warranted and heartfelt that they real gut you, because you know as the reader that in a book about two kids with cancer, a happy ending is not in the stars. I love the fact that they are so thoughtful, the terminality of their life forcing them to ponder the bigger, unanswerable questions of life. Its incredibly moving and heartbreaking to read about these brave young kids and how they wrap their minds around cancer and death. Thats the thing about pain, Augustus said, and then glanced back at me. It demands to be felt I also loved that despite their transcendental musings and their expertise in the vernacular of cancer, they were kids... teenagers who played video games and obsessed over a book An Imperial Affliction by the drunk recluse, yet brilliant Peter Van Houten. I found myself so quickly entrenched in this story, deeply devoted to its characters, prematurely distressed at what was yet to come. The fact that they fall in love is even harder to experience because I was so happy for them and at the same time, so very sad. Augustus is amazing, never afraid to be forthright about his feelings, while Hazen is more cautious with her expressions, but with such a loving heart just the same. Together, they are perfect. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities ... There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbound set. But Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldnt trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and Im grateful. I actually experienced this book via audible, in a version narrated by Kate Rudd. She was amazing too. I loved listening to the story... I could almost hear John Green himself in the speed and wit of the dialogue. I thought the story was so ingenious in the way it pulled you into scenes of funny conversation, then swiftly and unexpectedly delivered emotional gut punches that left you breathless. The last 30 or so had me crying big, fat, ugly, heartfelt tears and I honestly didnt stop until the last word was read, carrying the heaviness in my heart for the remainder of the day and even still. Its a beautiful story of love and life and figuring out how to work with the cruel hand some are inexplicably dealt. As I mentioned above, the book is deserving of all the accolades it has received and I anxiously await the movie next summer. This moving book solidly earns 6 stars from me. Im in love with you, and Im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. Im in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have, and I am in love with you.

Oh, rereading this book was the very best. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love these books. How much I adore all of these characters. How excited the plot makes me. These books are simply the best. And Im so thrilled that I just reread them all. But ahh, I want Winter now. Waiting for my preorders to arrive is going to be torture. Thankfully, this precious is out in just eight days now. Eeek. Cant believe I have waited so many years for this final book, and now it is finally almost here. Im the most excited. So far Cress is my favorite of all the three books. It is just so long and gorgeous and so much happens. But it is also the most heartbreaking and evil one too. Hmph. I think Winter is going to be even better and even worse, lol. I cannot wait. This is my favorite book, yes, but Cress isnt my favorite character. I mean, I love her just as much as I love everyone else. Shes the most adorable. But Cinder and Kai are still my favorites. I think. Scarlet and Wolf a close second. Probably. I love them all the same, I think. The writing in this third book is just as gorgeous as in the first books. Probably even more so. I love how amazing Marissa Meyer is at writing. Shes just the best. Oh so kind and oh so talented. I adore her the most. These books are just so easy to read, and I love that so much. Cress is always exciting. And evil too. I loved reading every moment of this book. I love that it is over five hundred pages. But love even more than Winter will be over eight hundred pages. Eeeek. I couldnt be more excited about it : I dont know what to say about this precious. I probably already said it all two years ago, as I wrote a very long review back then. But Im not rereading it, lol. I shall try to get my thoughts together. But oh, it is hard. Because I love this book so much. And I dont know how else to talk about it. Just, it is incredible. And I need you all to read this book already. You will not regret it. Even with the heartbreak, it is such a perfect read. And, I must admit it, I loved all the evil parts the most, lol. So well written. I cannot with how perfect all the characters in this book are. I adore reading more about Cinder. Shes just all kinds of awesome. I love how she learns more about her Lunar powers, and how she struggles with how she uses her powers. I love how shes still crushing on Kai. It is so cute. Mostly, I just think that Cinder is an amazing person. And I adore reading about her. And hmm. Thorne. I adore him too. He is in this book a lot. And awful things happen to him. Yet he is still so brave and charming. I liked him a lot. And oh, my precious Cress. Shes such an adorable girl. So short. So cute. So innocent. I loved how she was crushing on Thorne before and after she met him. It was so cute. Cress and Thorne spend a lot of time together in this book. And we get to know them both a lot. And oh, how I loved that. Thorne is pretty awesome. And Cress is so great too. I loved her so much. And them together is just so much fun. And a bit of heartbreak. And a small bit of romance. I ship them so hard. Ack. They are the cutest. 3 Warmth overtook her and Cress closed her eyes. She thought her arms wanted to wrap around his neck, but her whole body was vibrating and dizzy and she could barely keep her fingers clutched around the fabric of his shirt. There is so much I love about this book. How we learn a bit more about each of the characters. It is so awesome. Yet I do feel like I dont know nearly enough about Kai. Hmph. I so hope there will be a lot of him in book four. Pretty please. I need more of my lovely Kai. And more romance with him and Cinder, hih. I want that badly. Anyway. Getting to know the characters more was so awesome. Even Dr. Erland too. But my heart is still breaking from his story. It was so unfair. So mean. But I did love it too. Sort of. Reading about Scarlet and Wolf makes me so happy. Because they are all kinds of adorable. And they obviously love each other so much, despite Scarlet being a bit nervous around him. But yeah. He loves her so much. Sniffs. And then something really awful happens. And seeing how they react to that was so amazing. My heart is still hurting. Yet it was so great to read about. And my poor precious Scarlet. I just want her and Wolf to be happy, and together. Ahh. I need Winter right away. Hmph. Give it to me. Now. Im not going to say much more about this book. I just. I love it so much. The plot is so exciting. The war with Queen Levana is all kinds of horrifying and yet so interesting too. I cannot wait to read more about it. Im so glad that I reread Cress. Because I loved it even more this second time that I read it. Sigh. It is such a perfect book. Also, I have loved sharing teasers of it for two years now. Eeek. I also have this huge book collection of all the books. I will share that once I get all of my Winter copies :  I first read Cress on October 24th 2013. See my review of it here:  I read Cress for the second time from November 1st to 2nd. See my book recommendation here: 
THIS BOOK!! OH GOD COLLEEN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MEEE ?!! Update: Full review originally posted on my blog, The Bookish Khaleesi She loved me in quotations She kissed me in bold I TRIED TO KEEP HER in all caps She left with an ellipsis . . . The book follows Ben and Fallon, the most adorable couple! These two meet in a random diner when Ben pretends to be her fake boyfriend on November 9th and thus begin their whole arrangement. Every November 9th, they would meet and discuss the happenings throughout the year. However, they would not have any contact during the year except on that one day of the year. Being that Ben is an aspiring writer, he makes it his goal to write a book about their romance story and Fallon must follow her passion for acting and put herself out there more. I cant stress enough how fantastic this book was. I loved reading their meetings on this one day that would have been akward being that they hardly knew each other, but they had such a fantastic connection and chemistry it was refreshing. You watch these two fall in love in a short amount of time over the span of 5 years and it was deep. I dont know how CoHo does it, but she writes the best love stories I have ever read and each one shine its own light. Whether or not the couple ends up together at the end of a book doesnt determine whether that book has a happy ending or not. As long as the two people end up happy, it doesnt really matter if they end up happy together. Fallon was so dang relatable and I loved her for it. She is insecure. She is flawed and she learns and grows throughout the entire novel. She makes mistakes and she owns up to them. I admit, I was a little put off by how much she was insecure when Ben has done nothing but show her how beautiful she is despite her scars, but hey I would be the same way. It takes time. And it definitely took Fallon some time. She had a great sense of humor and a quick tongue that is expected from CoHo that had me LOLing all over the place. Ben on the other hand. Oh Ben, you precious cupcake. I am so in love with Benton James Kessler. He has just possessed a top on my top 5 Book Boyfriends, right along with Miles Archer and Dean Holder. Sorry guys, but Ben is giving you guys a run for your money. Ben is such a sweetie pie! He is loyal, and passionate, and funny, and dorky in the most sexy sort of way! I loved how he made it his mission to show Fallon that she was beautiful and wanted her to be happy in her own skin. He was protective of her and was so alphamale without even knowing he was doing it. I can go on and on about how much I love him. He goes through some terribly awful things in the book that you just want to give him a tight hug and never let go. Seriously, my heart was breaking for him. But he always followed his heart and that was makes him admirable. Shes not the kind of girl you choose your battles for. Shes the kind of girl you fight to the death for. THEIR ROMANCE IS LIFE! I think about you every second of every day and I dont know how to get over you, she says. Dont, I beg her. Please dont get over me. Honestly, this concept was such a delight. There was so mystery behind Ben and what his situation was that kept me so anxious to find out what he was hiding. I was literally so scared because being a CoHo book you just know something is going to go down! I loved how she involved Bens book that he was writing and that was how everything unraveled. Honestly, every time I thought I had it figured out I was still thrown for a loop. Plus, it was so awesome how much love was thrown towards book lovers and all our lingo. Ben was writing his own novel, how can that get more adorable?! If were going to kiss, it has to be bookworthy. Bonus: if youve read previous novels by Colleen, you will definitely appreciate a special cameo in this book. I was fangirling so hard I started jumping up and down when I read it. I was that excited! :D When you find love, you take it. You grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go. You cant just walk away from it and expect it to linger until youre ready for it. I feel the need to mention the only negative I have over this book. I hated how badly Fallon broke Ben in the most ridiculous way. I hate the way she reacted at the next years meet up. It made me so mad at her and I didnt blame Ben for one second when he started dating...someone else. Overall, this book was great. Colleen is great. She has never let me down and I will continue to read literally everything she writes. Beautiful story, beautiful characters, beautiful writing as always. Do yourself a favor and pick this up. I dont think youll be disappointed. GAH I WANT MORE!! Can I give all the stars? ALL THE STARS!
Just beta read this for the super talented RL Griffin and it is a truly brilliant conclusion to what has been an awesome series!! I seriously cant explain in words how much I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and how I have come to think of these characters as my closest friends sad I know!! but it is testament to the writing skills of RL Griffin. Emotional roller coaster but truly brilliant!! Full review to come Seamless By A Thread 3 by RL Griffin 5 stars!! That may be an appropriate statement, because in order to look seamless, you must need to have an entire world of shit going on under the surface. I dont see this seamless outside, but Ill tell you Ive never felt more lost inside. I honestly do not know where to start with this review. My emotions are all over the place, I am happy that Stella got her closure but I am pissed that this series is finished. It is one of those double edged swords...you want to know the end, but you dont want it to be the end. I would be quite happy to read about this group in perpetuity, such is the connection that I have to this series and the characters in it. Stella, she is absolutely, totally and utterly amazing. We all know the shit that she has been through in By A Thread and Tension and you know that Seamless is not going to be any different and oh my shit as Stella would say does she get it in spades. You are always wondering when Stella is going to catch a break but we know that with the threat of Jamie still hanging over her, it was not going to come anytime soon. This girl has been through the mill and then some, how she has come through it with her sanity intact will forever be a mystery but with the help of a therapist, George and her friends she is making great progress. For the majority of this book Stella really grew, she was becoming more assured of herself, despite the threats still lingering around. It isnt until she is cruelly let down that she then takes a lot of steps back and regresses to the old Stella. Why keep putting yourself back together if youre just going to keep breaking apart? Stella makes up her mind in this book, she wants her life back and she is going to do everything she can to achieve it, even if it makes her do some pretty hard and horrible things. I must say that some of the decisions that Stella makes during this journey brought me to my knees, literally. I had tears on tears. I was heart broken. I had to take a breather and regroup, message the author and tell her what a B she was and then got back to it. I have to applaud RL Griffin because she had the balls to go there even though it has probably decimated a lot of hearts in the process. It is a real I HATE YOU moment, but one that is typically Stella. Whatever happens, know that everything Im doing is for you. Im sorry I couldnt keep my promise, but know that you are the only one for me. Thats my forever. I really cannot go into details with this book, as you know from the series, the plot is intricate and complex and any slight discussions is going to give the game away so I have to keep my lips well and truly zipped with regards to this. Lets just say that it is a roller coaster ride, there are ups and downs, twists and turns, you are going to be scared witless and then relieved, you will be crushed and you will be slowly pieced back together again, it truly is one heck of a journey. This book really hit me hard, as I said I above, things happened that really took my breath away and I was extremely conflicted, however RL Griffin certainly stayed true to Stellas character and as this is Stellas story I am totally supportive even though it darn near destroyed me. The usual suspects all make appearances in this book, we have the gorgeous George who can totally do no wrong in my eyes. Millie, she is well...Millie...totally the best, best friend anyone could wish for and she is there for Stella as always. Jesse, friends to all and one to definitely have on side and he really does come through for them all once again in Seamless. Billy, well Billy is just Billy, he brings us the spells of entertainment but I am sure that there is a lot more to this character, I am sure we will find out when we get Patricks story. Which takes me to Patrick, we all know that he is Stellas person, I was always a bit wary of his motives, especially in By A Thread and then when the shit hit the fan he went down in my estimations even though I knew why he did what he did. In this book, I fell in love with Patrick, I cant wait to read his story, my heart broke over and over for him and I was totally crushed. He truly came through for Stella in this book, he went above and beyond, but what will the after effects be? Can Patrick come back from what went down in Seamless? Stella and George, I love them both dearly. Do they deserve a HEA, yes they do. Am I happy the way it ended, Yes and No. But it was brilliantly written, totally captivating, engaging and totally and utterly unpredictable. RL Griffin certainly has the romantic suspense genre sussed and throughout the whole series I have been sucked in from the first page till the last. This series is a must read, there is no other series in comparison, it is unique and one of a kind. I am so glad that I stumbled across By A Thread those many months ago and this series and these characters will forever hold a place dear in my heart. What a journey, what a climax and what an ending...RL Griffin, you certainly pulled it out the bag and whilst I have been put through the mill, it was worth every single minute, fantastic series, you should be so proud. I cannot wait to see what this author delivers next, whatever it is will be an auto 1click by me. Her love might not be perfect, but what love is? www.theromancecover.com
This review was originally posted on Addicted To Romance Summary Stefano Ferraro has always been able to get access to fast cars, women with zero commitment, and keeping his family secret from everyone apart from those closest to the family. Stefano has always known duty and honor, he lives up to what is expected from him. But he is keeping a secret, a secret that allows him to seek justice for those that the law is unable to protect. Stefano has everything he could want or atleast in the view of the public except one thing, a woman to love and a family. He dreams of finding the one woman for him, that will match him and be his in every way. Until one day he catches a womans laugh, a stranger who has just come to town. Shaking from the cold, weak from hunger and hiding from her past, Francesca Cappello isnt ready for this stranger who intimidates her in every way possible, but makes her feel safe. Francesca has had it pretty rough, and doesnt trust anyone except her close friend who brought her to Chicago. She doesnt trust especially men with money, especially those that have it easy like the Ferraro family. But soon Francesca has gained the attention of dark and dangerous Stefano and doesnt know if she has what it takes to handle him...and she soon realizes that their love is worth fighting for! The Hero Stefano Ferraro is one of the few shadow riders left in the world. He is the oldest brother, and will do anything for his siblings. Each of them are shadow riders, and went through rigorous and for some horrible training. Their family has a great legacy, one that isnt easy to live up to. Stefano is the toughest of them all, he is the leader and he has made it his lifes mission to protect his family. He has dedicated his whole life since he could walk to being a shadow rider, protecting the innocent, and seeing to his familys needs. He does what is necessary and doesnt apologize for actions he has had to commit. Stefano isnt a easy hero, but he is a hero you want by your side. He is tough, intimidating and pretty scary at times. He is alpha male, but is patient when he needs to be.He can be intense but is loyal and devoted once he commits!! I really liked this hero quite a bit, much more than the more recent ones that Feehan has created. The Heroine Francessa Capello has had a rough time of it lately. Her parents were killed when they were younger, and she only had her sister. They took care of each other. But then her sister was murdered and the man to blame, has power, police and the law behind him. He has destroyed everything she worked for, and has to be living on the streets to stay one step ahead of him. But now she has a fresh start, somewhere new and hoping to have time to gather what she needs to fight him to get justice for her sister. What she doesnt expect is to be bull dozed over by the most compelling man she has ever met, Stefano. She fears what he is a part of, but cant deny the magnetism, or the sizzling chemistry she feels for him or how safe he makes her feel when he is close. What a heroine this one turned out to be. Probably one of my favorites that Feehan has created. She has some issues to work through, especially when it comes to self confidence, however she has her own strength and I like how sassy she becomes with Stefano and stands on her own feet. She doesnt let the fear control how she handles him. We see her become stronger throughout the story and I liked seeing her inner strength come shining through. Plot and Story Line WHAT a book!! Christine Feehan has done it with this one and I fell in love with so many aspects of this story. Before reading it, I had browsed a few ratings and reviews just to get an idea of what to expect but all I heard were positive things about this new series!! I will admit I was a bit nervous to read this one. Mostly because the past two books from this author I have read, the heroes I had a hard time with, they were jerks and I couldnt stand how they treated their women. However this book completely blew me away!!! First off, the worldbuilding is pretty wonderful. It is still full of mystery and intrigue but I loved what Feehan has shown us so far. This book pulled me in with the first page and I couldnt put it down!! So compelling and I loved the chemistry between these two. I did like that they didnt have sex until half way, it really built it up just right!! Now the heat is pretty high, and some scenes werent my favorite. Not a big fan of the BDSM style and it was lighter than typical BDSM but it did have some elements that might not be for everyone. Frankly, I skimmed over those parts, since I didnt feel the need to read them but many will enjoy how Feehan did these scenes. The family that Feehan introduces to us is freakin AWESOME!! I loved each and every sibling. They each are a bit different, have unique personalities. The sister was my favorite though, she is kick ass but I have a feeling she has quite a few vulnerabilities we havent seen yet. What is so wonderful about this family is the way they protect each other, watch over one another and support each other in ways that is mind boggling. Seriously, this family almost brought me to tears. All of them have been through hell of training, and each suffer the scars from the past, but they are strong and hilarious at times. What was most admirable is the way they look out for Francesca. The moment that Stefano finds her, they treat her as their own. It really creates the perfect setting because Francesca has no family left and they fill that gap she craves. The actual romance between Stefano and Francesca is beautifully written. I loved the depth and rich tones you feel with these two. Trust that always, always, before any other, I will have your back. Ill keep you safe. Ill make you happy and give you the world. They have some hurdles to cross, but their story is quite tender yet intense at the same time!! And the bad villain gets his just deserts which I felt was just perfect seeing that. I am curious to see which sibling will be next!! : The Cover Interesting, it definitely gives the feels that the book conveys so I do like the shadow effect here!! Overall View Shadow Rider is a thrilling tale that will have you on edge, a romance that is tender and a story you dont want to miss out on!! A TRUE JEWEL!!
We believe what we want to believe. We believe what we need to believe. Maybe theres no difference between wanting and needing. I dont know. What I do know is that the truth can evade us, hiding behind our blind spots, our preconceptions, our hungry hearts that long for quiet. Still, it is always there if we open our eyes and try to see it. Three years ago, highschool senior Emma Tanner and her 15yearold sister Cassandra went missing. Investigators had little evidence to go on; all they knew was that there were two missing girls and an abandoned car at the beach. The case went unsolved, but Cass has returned home, seemingly out of thin air. She insists that Emma is still out there and she knows how to find her. FBI psychologist Dr. Abigail Winter was haunted by the Tanner case. During the course of the investigation, she began to see shades of her own narcissistic mother in Judy Martin. She believed that the girls mother may have been involved in their disappearance, but no one else was receptive to her theory. The case brought some of her old traumas back to the surface. Could she have been letting her personal life cloud her perception? Casss mysterious reappearance may finally let her get some closure. Everyone I could ever trust, everyone you could ever trust, could betray you. It doesnt matter who they are or whether they mean to do it. Your friends. Your husband. Your wife. Your siblings. Your child. Even your parents. Some people just do it and they dont care. They dont think twice about it. But others do it and they justify it in their heads so you cant even blame them. They have their reasons. The mothers narcissism leads to an interesting dynamic between the sisters. Each girl developed their own unique way of coping. Growing up, their home was filled with constant hostility. There was little stability in their lives because the sisters never knew which version of their mother they would wake up to. They were both desperate for their mothers love and Mrs. Martin made them earn it. She always made snide comments to remind the girls of their place in the house. She couldnt stand for her daughters to become close and potentially form an alliance against her, so she set out to drive a wedge between them. Emma was one of the only people Cass could depend on, but she could also be extremely cruel, rubbing their mothers favoritism in Casss face. I think there are two types of people. Ones who have a scream inside them and ones who dont. People who have a scream are too angry or too sad or laugh too hard, swear too much, use drugs or never sit still. Sometimes they sing at the top of their lungs with the windows rolled down. I dont think people are born with it. I think other people put it inside you with the things they do to you, and say to you or the things you see them do or say to other people. And I dont think you can get rid of it. If you dont have a scream, you cant understand. Cassandra shares a name with a figure from Greek mythology, a princess of Troy who had the gift of prophecy but the curse that her prophecies would never be believed. Cass shared that same burden during her parents custody battle. She knew that living with her mother and stepfather would end badly for everyone involved, but she learned the hard way that seeing the future is a worthless gift if you dont have the power to change it. Emma talked Cass into testifying against their mother, but in a cruel twist, Emma ended up siding with their mother. Mrs. Martin easily won custody of the girls and would never forgive Casss betrayal. Cass lost her status in the home and Emma became the preferred daughter. A story is more than the recounting of events. The events are the sketch, the outline, but it is the colors and the landscape and the medium and the artists hand that make it what it is in the end. I had to be a good artist. I had to find talent where none existed and this story in a way they would believe. I had to set aside my own feelings about the past. ... I had to be the person they wanted me to be. The chapters alternate between Cass and Dr. Winter. Throughout the book, Cass reveals the events of the last three years. She insists that her mother is present to hear every detail. Theres something strange about the way Cass tells her story. The emotions she displays dont always match the events shes describing. Her demeanor is calm as she describes the last three years in horrifying detail. Her storytelling is very precise and polished. Sometimes Cass comes across like a child, but other times she seems wise beyond her years. Occasionally, Cass glances at Dr. Winter and theres a flicker of recognition between them. Dr. Winter begins to wonder if she needs to begin paying more attention to the things that arent being said. I read the first 40 in one sitting, but I had a hard time settling back into the story the next day. I think its because all the different elements are jumbled together, regardless of whose chapter youre in: the search for Emma, Dr. Winters backstory, the story Cass is telling the detectives, and the story shes telling the reader. Not being able to maintain that immersion is sometimes a dealbreaker for me, but Walkers writing still captivated me. I value a story where the author takes me from feeling one way about a character to feeling completely opposite by the end of the story. Despite the messed up things that went on in Casss home, I found her demeanor a bit offputting at first. There was a moment when I began understanding her behavior and motivations right or wrong, and thats when this story started to worm its way into my heart. There is evil in the world and that evil can dress up as love so convincingly that it blinds you to the truth. Cass describes herself as a bird on the battlefield. She spent her entire life being caught between forces much more powerful than herself. Shes been let down by all the adults in her life. Anyone who listened to her was powerless to do anything. Cass has to be the person everyone wants her to be in order to get the people with power to finally listen to her. Could this be her one chance to finally be heard? Is she even telling the truth? Will the investigators find Emma in time? This stirring tale shows how easily our perceptions can be manipulated and how sometimes people have to be tricked into seeing the truth. Just like a narcissist has to create a perfect alter ego to protect themselves, sometimes we have to find ways to maintain the realities weve constructed to prevent our worldview from being shattered. The more literary writing style of this book reminded me of Everything You Want Me to Be by Mindy Mejia. If youre looking for more books with narcissistic mothers, you might enjoy Mother, Mother by Koren Zailckas.  I received this book for free from Netgalley and St. Martins Press. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. It will be available August 8, 2017.
I have to hand it to you, April. You truly know how to test human endurance. After my usual routine of blasting NPR all week at work while entering data, I decided yesterday that I had well beyond reached my horror, disgust, frustration, and doomsdayfears capacity, shut off the station, plugged up my ears, and listened to 69 Love Songs and mums discography all the way through instead. Despite the fact that I keyed in the date hundreds of times, it never crossed my mind what the symbol I was repeatedly creating actually stands for in the context of my lifetime. April 19th, April 19th, April 19th. Only once I arrived home and was halfway through my allnighter read of the last 13rd of this book did the lightbulb illuminating reality decide to flicker back on, and I realized my disturbingly appropriate timing. I finished reading Dave Cullens sobering journalistic piece on the Columbine Massacre in the early morning hours of the 14th anniversary of the Columbine Massacre. Not just that, but I had spent the entire previous evening typing in the 20 year anniversary date of the siege at Waco, and the 18th year after the Murrah bombing. And I grew up in Oklahoma City. The world is currently so chaotic that I completely blanked on all the other major tragedies I had grown up around, and even seen firsthand. Jaded, or simply overwhelmed by the flood of refuse we have recently been forced to swim through, I dont like the idea that so much misery could slip from memory so easily. However, I know am not alone in forgetting. As Cullen points out, not one change was made to gun laws in the wake of Columbine. People just...moved on to other things. Of course, leeway regarding my temporary amnesia is a given considering the events of the last week, nay, the last year or so. I did, however, realize beforehand that my eyes had stopped on and selected this title on my bookshelf due to the recent resurgence of futile debates centering on gun control in the United States. It felt like an appropriate time to revisit this many times since trumped tragedy, as it seems to be the point where the world really began to notice what was already an epidemic of glorification of and widespread access to semiautomatic weapons in this country. No, I do not wish to debate this matter. I dont want to take your gun away. I do, however, think popular opinion regarding things like background checks and the future sale of militarygrade assault weapons to civilians has made its voice well known, and in a shout, at that. Regardless, it doesnt really matter what I think anyway. Apparently, it doesnt even matter one whit what most of us think. In the weeks before the shooting in Colorado, Eric Harris wrote in his journal to lament the existence of background checks in his state, then went on to examine the Brady Bill in detail, eventually celebrating all the loopholes present for gun shows. The semiautomatic rifle and two shotguns used by the killers would, as a result, come from gun shows. Interpret and respond to that information however you will. Again, it wont matter. There are a few distinct items that I would like to address about this book which form a sort of trinity of deception and misconception concerning the event, much of which is still popular, though indisputably refuted, belief regarding the hows and whys. When Cullen is at his most fierce, he is taking on the Medias misleading and exploitative coverage, the law enforcement coverups of their own ineptitude via literal documentshredding combined with the revealing information they protected us from for years after the massacre, and the Churchs nonstop capitalizing on the inevitable shock and aftershock. Having been in high school during the shooting, it is not a faint memory. We all remember a few things about the tragedy: the boys who did this were social outcasts. The boys who did this targeted jocks and popular kids. One girl pronounced her love of God just before being executed, thereby becoming a modernday martyr. It was presented as a classic good vs. evil, wholesome vs. strange, God vs. The Devil dichotomy of humanity. Oh, and the media ate it up. The Jefferson County Sheriffs Department allowed it to swell to a frenzy of widelyembraced misinformation, despite striking amounts of classified, naturally hard evidence to the contrary. The Church used it as a recruitment tool, at times callously reveling in their good fortune in the aftermath of the tragedy. A perfect storm of nonsense rained down. The facts? Cassie Bernall was not the girl who professed her Christianity, despite what the Church and publishers of her biography will have you believe even to this day. The real source of this pronouncement of faith did not die, and the last word Cassie Bernall heard before being shot in the head was not God, but peekaboo. The killers were not social outcasts, were not part of the high school goth clique known as The Trench Coat Mafia, their targets were not specific and retributionbased, but rather: blind, indiscriminate. Their aim was maximum carnage, the highest possible body count. Both boys came from stable, supportive twoparent homes. They were not bullied, they didnt listen to Marilyn Manson or worship Satan, they were not isolated from or ridiculed by their peers any more than every other high schooler endures at one point or another. Dylan Klebold attended his prom two days before the shooting. Eric Harris had a belt on which were many notches, and his female schoolmates widely considered him desirable. These were not vengeful weirdos, but a certifiable psychopath and the suicidal depressive who clung to the formers shadow for sustenance. The emotionally void alpha and the overemotioned and erratic submissive, each on his own quest for death: one to die in infamy, the other simply to die. Cullens narrative, though presented in a nonlinear fashion, manages to lay out a timeline for the events, to examine the real, inevitably complex psychology behind the tragedy, and to debunk the entire, entirely false widespread memory that is the events of April 20th, 1999. Considering the facts, and by that I mean the real facts, can be terrifying. I understand why a lot of people would love to believe that simple things like antibullying programs or church camp could work to prevent another such shooting. Of course, those of us who have been paying attention know beyond a shadow of a doubt that things have only gotten worse since Klebold and Harris took their own lives. The simple fact is that two neurologically impaired juvenile felons were allowed ready access to highpowered weaponry designed for battlefields, making a warzone of their own high school, and because of, well, nothing really. The inanity alone is maddening. The true causes are no sources of comfort, but it is crucial that we as a society force ourselves to face them, and to take the appropriate precautionary steps, particularly regarding the availability of frighteningly effective means to spree kill. Especially now. Right now. Turn on your television and then tell me you dont at least see my point.
Originally Posted On The Sassy Book Geek Dawn Kurtagich does it again with yet another amazingly creepy psychological horror book! I dont think I can ever be disappointed with one of her books since I loved her debut The Dead House my expectations for And The Trees Crept In were high and I wasnt let down. This is definitely a book for horror lovers and perfect for Halloween! The Plot Firstly, this book was ACTUALLY scary I mean it is one of the few books that truly scared me. A lot of horror books are usually one of two things: quiet horror or jumpy horror, and yet this book happens to be both. Theres a fair share of quiet, creepy, and suspenseful scares as well as a few jump scares that had me setting the book down so I could take a breather. I was tense the entire time I was reading and thats something I look for in a good YA horror book or horror book period. The atmosphere was also on point, it was incredibly eerie and was one of the best parts of the book. Ive read quite a few horror books and seen many, many horror movie and so my standards for what I find scary are high and I was very impressed with this. Now normally Id try and give you a little synopsis of the plot but I just dont dare say much because the more blind you go into this book the better. There are so many crazy twists that you wont see coming AT ALL and theres so much mystery as to what is actually happening that you just have to keep reading. We start out the story with Silla and Nori arriving in the dead of night to their Aunt Caths manor in the middle of the forest. As the story progresses we slowly learn more about the house, how Silla and Nori came to be at the house, and the history between Cath and Silla and Noris mother. Then theres the arrival of an odd young man, Caths mental abscence, the depletion of the food supply, the creeping trees, and finally....The Creeper Man. With the many different things happening its up to Silla to sort everything out and determine if she can truly trust anyone or even her own mind as the trees slowly creep in.... I loved how we couldnt trust anyone or anything that was happening throughout this book it added so much to the mystery, the eeriness, and the terror. Are the trees actually moving? Is the Creeper Man real or a figment of Sillas imagination? What made this even more horrifying was that you can try and answer these questions yourself but you wont be able too, as I said the plot twists were insane and you just wont see them coming. This book is also very fast paced and will have you turning pages and finishing it in no time! I will say that the pacing for me slowed down a bit about 34 of the way through because lets be honest the book got very weird and confusing. However, this just made the story even better when I finally got to the end and sorted everything out! So if you find yourself muddling along towards the end be patient because the ending is very satisfying although I thought the conclusion took a bit away from the scariness  I wont elaborate because of spoilers. Another very unique thing about this book? The formatting. Just based on Dawn Kurtagichs two books she is a queen of great formatting, it adds so much to the atmosphere of her books. There are notes, journal entries, and just a few other oddly formatted pages. I think it makes for a more fun reading experience as well! The Characters If theres one thing I ever find very lacking in horror books its character development and this book definitely is not lacking. We get so much insight into every single character, especially Silla since she narrates a majority of the time I got to really know each character and feel their hysteria as the events of the book progressed. This book is very much psychologically driven so getting into Sillas mind was necessary and Dawn Kurtagich did it so well. We got flashbacks of Sillas memories as well as good looks into her mind set via journal entries and notes. I also found all of the characters quite..relatable which is odd since there is nothing relatable about their situation at all for me but that just goes to show how well written and complex they were. The Romance I will just say this now: I am not a fan of Dawn Kurtagichs romances. I did not like the romance in The Dead House and I didnt like it in And The Trees Crept In either unfortunately. I just find them to be kind of unnecessary and take away from the creepy atmosphere. This romance also kind of had a degree of instalove and just felt very underwhelming. Although I will say at the end I warmed up to it a little bit...but not much. In Conclusion I was very impressed with this book but the romance, my occasional confusion, and a very tiny personal issue with the ending kept this from being a true 5 star read for me. I will definitely be reading anything and everything that Dawn Kurtagich continues to write though because she is certainly proving herself to be a real YA horror genius! Recommend? Yes I highly recommend reading And The Trees Crept In! Especially if youre looking for your next keep the lights on all night horror book or something to read for Halloween this week!
Lucy, is all he can seem to say. Lucy. How am I going to walk away from tonight? Seriously. How? I get goosebumps. Im wondering the same thing. I let my head drop to one side, and we kiss. Im hoarse and breathless. Im gonna die tonight. Please take your pants off. I want that embroidered on a pillow. True story  earlier this week I reviewed the amazing Burn Down the Night by M. OKeefe and I said it was my favorite book so far in 2016. The very next book I read happened to be The Hating Game by debut author, Sally Thorne....and I have a new favorite book. Yes, two favorite books in a row, which never happens and Im kind of freaking out and I have that jittery feeling I get after reading excellent books maybe others get it from too much coffee. This book is so adorable, so romantic, funny, the best banter, amazing, gutwrenching sexual tension, I cant even deal with my life. Im not being dramatic at all! The premise  Lucy worked for a quaint, very bookishnerdy publishing house called Gamin, but they struggled financially. To save their business, they merged with the cold, serious, rigid publishing house called Bexley. The Bexleys are hard geometrics, the Gamins are soft scribbles. Lucy is the assistant to Gamins CEO and our hero, Josh, is the assistant to Bexleys CEO. When the companies merged, Lucy and Josh got placed inside the same office and from day one they have hated each other. Im never alone in here. Sitting opposite me is the executive assistant to Mr. Bexley. His henchman and manservant. The second thing, the most essential thing anyone needs to know about me, is this: I hate Joshua Templeman. Hes currently copying every move I make. Its the Mirror Game. To the casual observer it wouldnt be immediately obvious; hes as subtle as a shadow. But not to me. Each movement of mine is replicated on his side of the office on a slight time delay. I lift my chin from my palm and swivel to my desk, and smoothly he does the same. Im twentyeight years old and it seems Ive fallen through the cracks of heaven and hell and into purgatory. A kindergarten classroom. An asylum. I type my password: IHATEJOSHUA4EV. Josh is meticulously organized, has a temper, can kill people with the glares he gives them. He wears the same colored shirts on the same day of the week. He goes to the gym several times a day. He survives on mints. He isnt human, he never smiles, and Lucy cant stand him. Lucy is barely five feet tall and Josh is way over six feet  and their height differences makes her feel super short and she hates that. Put me down. This isnt funny. My feet make little ineffectual spirals. This isnt the first time a big kids thrown his weight around with me. Marcus DuShay in third grade once slung me onto the hood of the principals car and ran off laughing. The plight of the little humans. There is no dignity for us in this oversize world. Visit me up here for a sec. What on earth for? I try to slide down but he spans his hands on my waist and presses me against the wall. I squeeze his shoulders until I come to the informed conclusion that his body is extravagant muscle under these Clark Kent shirts. Holy shit. His collarbone is like a crowbar under my palms. I say the only idiotic thing I can think of. Muscles. Bones. Thanks. When a new position is opening up, one they both want, their hate takes on a new level, as they are going to have to compete for this job. Told all in Lucys point of view  the absolute best thing about this book is that you know right from the start that Josh is in love with her. That his surly, bitter attitude comes from being a bit shy and stubborn and not being able to admit his feelings. Instead he lashes out around her, because he is a big oaf and Lucy thinks he absolutely hates her. They play stupid games like The staring game where they face off glares at each other. They have to completely lock down their desk because they dont trust the other not to snoop when one walks away from their desk. She has never once seen him smile and it bugs the hell out of her. But then things start to change. Lucy has a rare date with a coworker and Josh loses it. Lucy gets ill, and Josh takes care of her for a weekend. Their dynamic shifts into possible and very fragile friends. A few things I have to point out: The banter in this book is absolutely adorable. It made me laugh out loud. When his bedroom door opens and he appears again, I am a mature young woman, legs elegantly crossed, flipping through a medical textbook, sipping my tea. Hes got on some soft black sweats, a black Tshirt, and nice bare feet. Cant he have a flaw? He sits on the edge of the couch, his hair damp and ruffled in every direction. I turn the page and unfortunately a lurid diagram of an erect penis glares up at me. I am trying to be a bit more normal. He looks at the page. Hows it working out so far? It made me smile so hard. It made me not want to put my kindle down and see what was happening on Twitter. Thats big, folks. The sexual tension in this book made me want to read faster and faster, yet I wanted to savor every word so I read slow. Whats with the weird eyes? Relax. I was thinking how big you are. I look at our joined hands. He carefully strokes the length of my palm with his thumb. When we look at each other again, his eyes are a little darker. Ill fit you just right. It hurt!!! It hurts because you know Josh is so freaking in love with Lucy, yet the author tortures you with this. And even after Lucy realizes what a hot, sexy beast Josh is and she jumps him at one point she literally hugs him like a koala and he walks around his apartment with her like this doing menial tasks Josh refuses to get nakey and give her hot sexin because he is afraid she will freak out afterwards. He takes things slooooow and I wanted to kill him and jump him myself. He catches my hand at the curb and walks across the street with me. When we reach my car, I tilt my mouth up to his. He carefully takes my face in his hands and he kisses me. A simultaneous shocked gasp rocks us. Its like we havent kissed in an eternity. He presses me against the car door and I whimper. Tongues, teeth, breath. You taste like my Easter egg. Please, please. I need you so badly. Ill see you at work tomorrow, he replies. He turns me in his arms, and presses his mouth against the back of my neck. The wait is worth it though  I wasnt sure if this book would go into the bedroom  but oh yes it does. The end is so, so romantic. The declaration of love is one of the best ever. It goes on and on and its so ridiculously romantic I just loved it. I think I highlighted three pages and wanted to paste them into the review  but that would kind of ruin the buildup of the book for you. This is the type of book that is filled with little things that will be caught on a second read through. Ive already started reading it again. I cant help myself. Little things Josh does  that Lucy doesnt catch onto but the reader will. Its a book full of games and competition. A glance from Lucy to a mirror in their office to see Josh can be so big in this book. There are so many little things that say, Oh  I see what you did there, author. I could listen to Lucy and Josh bicker and laugh and love each other day after day after day. Grade: A
 spoiler alert  Let me ask you something, what if you were cursed that every person you love will die and the next day your sister died? Are you going to be cold to everyone just to protect them? What if you have a best friend thats slowly dying and then suddenly a girl came into your life and is threatening to melt the icy wall you put around yourself? You then fell for her and she is to you but you still shoo her away for you dont want her to die like your sister did. And then, just when you learned that the curse was false and there is a chance for you to still end up with her, just when your own best friend already proposing to her and she already said, Yes. to him? Whatll you do? This is what William Will Herondale is currently experiencing. Already broken by the false curse and got more broken when Tessa Gray, the woman he dearly loves already said the sweet Yes. to his best friend, James Jem Carstairs when he proposed to her. One adjective can only describe this and that is heartwarming. I must admit, when I was still reading Clockwork Angel, I already had this feeling that clearly says Tessa is so going to end up with Will! . But then, after reading it, I got mad at the guy for what he just did to Tessa and like her, find comfort with Jem. On Clockwork Prince, I got torn over Will and Jem and I dont know which team Ill be on. But then, when Wills real past was revealed, and because of this letter, my insights on the love triangle between WillTessaJem changed. Yes, because of this letter I am now a WillTessa fan! I wish Cassandra Clare will end Tessa with Will and Jem to Cecily! I heard some rumors that Cecily will have a crush on Jem! I know that both of them deserve Tessa especially since Jem is slowly dying but still, I think Will needs Tessa more than Jem. But who am I to judge? Whoever Tessa choose in Clockwork Princess, may it be Will or Jem, I just hope that it is for the best. Thats all! : TESSAWILL FOREVER Merged review: I had finally be able to read this thanks to those who posted it to their comments! : Anyway, just by reading this, I could already tell how much Will is willing to sacrifice just for the happiness of Jem. Now thats what I call noble . Others when was torn between love of friendship will choose love rather than the friendship they shared and earned hard for. And I think Jem will do the same thing for Will, if Will confessed his feelings for Tessa sooner. Will and Jem are one of those people who have a strong bonded friendship. Only few people have those. And for that, I salute them especially to Will. Merged review: Only one word can describe this book. Amazing. I even pondered over myself, why the heck I stopped reading it before and claiming I had lost interest in it and read the first book of the Hush Hush series by Becca Fitzpatrick instead? I must be not on myself at that time. This book is amazing . No doubt. I love everything in this book and I must say it is better than the first one. It impressed me a lot . The last events are a major cliffhanger! The thing that made me want to bang my head! It already happened to me before on The Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan and would love to if it wont happen again . But NO! Urgh! I REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHO WILL REALLY END UP WITH TESSA! I am neither Team Will or Team Jem though I must admit, I favored Will more. But if Tessa will end up with Jem, its fine with me too. Fine! Im on Team Will! I could really as in really understand the situation of Will! Now we all know why he was so cold! HE JUST WANTED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE HE LOVE! Now thats what I call a noble! Curse that demon Marbas for tricking Will! I always pondered some what ifs while reading this book. What if young twelve year old Will didnt open the Pyxis? What if his sister, Ella didnt die the next day? What if Will didnt run for home and train as a Shadowhunter? Now, there are some what ifs that if it did happen, Will wont meet Jem nor Tessa. Wheres the fun in that? But the real what if thats going in my mind is, what if Jem didnt propose? What if Will already knew the truth and confessed to Tessa before Jem? But again, wheres the fun in that? Will should know that even if hes like Jace from Mortal Instruments series, he cant have everything he wants. But I still admire him for being able to hide his feelings and just be happy for his parabatai. Now, thats what I call a true friend! Or in this case, true parabatai! I love the dramatic love triangle between WillTessaJem. And also about Mortmain, Clockworks and Nates last request to Tessa that she always wear her necklace. I think that necklace will be handy in the future. I still have doubts that Tessas parents are Shadowhunter and Demon. But I guess well find it out sooner. IS IT JUST ME OR CECILY AND JEM WILL BE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER? THERE ARE SOME RUMORS THAT SAYS CECILY WILL HAVE A CRUSH ON JEM! SO THAT, JUST IN CASE TESSAWILL DO END UP TOGETHER, JEM WILL STILL HAVE SOMEONE RIGHT? : I wish Cassandra Clare will release the next book aka Clockwork Princess AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!
Originally Posted On The Sassy Book Geek I would first like to say I read Cinder by Marissa Meyer a while ago and was not impressed and vowed to not read any of her works again because of the issues I had with Cinder. I assumed everything she wrote would all be the same, which was clearly very stubborn of me. So its kind of a big deal when I say that I not only read Heartless but really, really loved it. I have been won over! It also may have something to do with the fact that I love Alice in Wonderland retellings..... The Plot For those of you who dont know this isnt just a retelling of Alice in Wonderland, oh no. Its an origin story for the Queen of Hearts herself....which makes it all the more fun am I right? One of my biggest complaints about Heartless is that its pacing is extremely slow and a bit tedious at times. I would say this is true for about three quarters of the book and the last quarter it definitely picks up and gets REALLY interesting! This was kind of a meh or okay for a lot of the book but damn that ending completely won me over! I have seen a lot of negative reviews for this book and their problems were with the slow pacing and the plot itself. You see the plot is mainly about Catherine not wanting to marry the King of Hearts and thats really all there is to it which does get very repetitive and boring, I agree. However, I overlooked that because I was having so much fun with the characters and references to Alice in Wonderland. I would say the slow pacing has a lot to do with the plot not really moving in any other direction for a long duration of the story. Theres also an inclusion of the Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater nursery rhyme which I thought was pretty neat. Just saying. I also loved the way Marissa Meyer weaved in her Wonderland references without infodumping us. We are, after all, pretty familiar with the Alice in Wonderland and I thought that made it all the more fun to pick out her references while reading. The ending was my favorite part of the story because of how dark, twisted, and awesome it is! I loved seeing what happened to Catherine that turned her in to the beheading crazy Queen of Hearts we all know and I was NOT disappointed! Actually I take that back I was disappointed because with that ending I thought this was a series but alas its a standalone and Im very upset..... image error I want more! So while the pacing is slow and plot is more or less a little boring its still okay because this is more of a character driven book in the first place. The Characters As I said this is a very character driven book so the characters are pretty important and Meyer does a great job of making them as interesting and complex as possible. I think you can have a boring plot and the book will still be great if you do a good job developing your characters and thats proven in Heartless. Catherine is a likable enough main character shes sweet, kind, and the most fantastic baker in all of Hearts which made for some stomachrumbling reading. I ended up being very sympathetic to Catherines cause, she wants to open a bakery and her mother wants her to marry the king and become Queen of Hearts. You can see how those two wants would conflict and I just became very invested in Catherines plight. Jest, the new court joker, is also a very interesting character and also the love interest. He wasnt particularly the best character or even my favorite character but he was very charming and a lot of fun , if that makes sense. I also really loved his bird companion Raven, who speaks in poetry and quotes Edgar Allan Poes The Raven which was hilarious! Hatta aka The Mad Hatter, speaking of which the name Hatta for this character drove me insane! Its just stupid to me and I hated pronouncing it Hatta in my head! was also a great character and stayed pretty true to the Alice in Wonderland character. Even if he was rude sometimes.....but youll understand when you read his origin story which I thought was very interesting and adds a lot to your perspective of the Mad Hatter. I, of course, have to mention how much I loved Cheshire because I always love the Cheshire Cat in every Alice in Wonderland related work. Hes just as mischievous as always! Theres also a slew of other characters that were absolutely wonderful as well and even if we saw very little of them I still feel like they had a complexity all their own. The Romance As you all already know it takes a lot for me to enjoy YA romances since theyre usually so full of cliches. While I did catch a whiff of some instalove at first this romance was not completely nauseating. It was a bit charming and a bit cute but overall it was just sort of okay and I didnt mind it but I didnt love it either. However, the romance between Cath and Jest is a major plot point and yet it never feels like it totally takes over which is definitely a plus. In Conclusion Overall I very much enjoyed this book even though it had a few issues I was able to easily overlook them and still end up loving Heartless. What I Liked: The Alice in Wonderland references and that this world stayed pretty true to the original The characters were interesting and complex That ending! Cheshire What I Disliked: The pacing was very slow The overall plot was a bit boring The romance was just okaymeh Recommend? I definitely recommend reading Heartless if youre willing to push through the slow pacing and get to that wonderful ending but if you arent a fan of slow books and lose patience quickly then maybe give this one a skip. Also if youre like me and didnt love Cinder by Marissa Meyer and arent sure if you want to give this book a try I strongly urge you to take the plunge! I really disliked Cinder and ended up not only loving Heartless but am now willing to dive back into the Lunar Chronicles as well!
Omfg! Love love love! for more of my reviews and the better version of this one  www.thereviewsofmar.blogspot.com note: I feel very stupid for not having read this book before. I loved this book, and its one of the best Ive read this whole year. and its the last day of the year, so it means a lot when I say its one of the best of the year I do totally get why this is the book of the year on goodreads. This is my last review of the year, and I think that its a good closer of the year, or however you say that : the book: It is the future. Beatrice is just a normal girl, 16 years old. She looks younger, but doesnt know that because she can not watch into mirrors. Thats because she belongs to the faction Abnegation. People in Abnegation are selfless. On her sixteenth birthday Beatrice has to choose which faction she wants to belong to. Amity, for the people that blame agression. Erudite, for the people that blame ignorance. Candor, for those who blame duplicity. Abnegation, for those who blame selfishness. Or Dauntless, for those who blame cowardice. One day before the choosing cermony, she has an aptitude test, which gives unusual results. Beatrice later Tris s life will not be the same after hearing the results. Which faction is she going to choose. With her choice she surprises everyone, including herself. Then she has to do the initiation tests. But they are harder than they seemed, will she make it to the Faction. During her initiation period friendship and romance play a big role in Triss life. But she has to keep her secret, no matter what price. the book: OMG I loved this book. Since its the last day of the year, and the last 4 hours of the year and the last review of the year I will not review the book the usual way... Okay, Im just too lazy at the moment but I have to finish this review because it was AWESOME! Immediately when you start reading this book, you are sucked into Triss life. Her life is very interesting, and first you want to be like her. Then you find out that she has a secret, and her life changes because of it. But she stays this awesome character, a strong female, even when everyone picks on her because she is from Abnegation and she looks younger than the rest. She kept on surprising me until the end of the book. Then there are the other characters, and some of them were evil, some were not what they seemed. Some were both. All of them were interesting. I want to know more about everyone! But I am most interested in Four. Yes, his name says enough, its very interesting, right?! Because you can choose your own name and stuff... the book was beautifully written, not annoying at all, and I loved it, so much! I started reading this book in the middle of the night, and I couldnt put it down, so I read until 3AM. Then I had to stop but the next morning I finished it. In the end I saw it were 478 pages, and I felt like it were only 200. I want more. NOW!!! The story was very interesting. I want to live in a world like that. It somehow reminded me of the history of the Italian city Siena, and its history. That city was divided into factions 12 or something and everyone belonged to a faction. You were born in a faction, and there were old friendships between the factions. Also there were the enemies, that would never be friends... This book with the factions reminded me a lot of that. Then you have the love in this book, which was awesome. I cannot tell you much about it without spoiling, but I love love loved the romance in this book. This book also somehow reminded me of the Hunger Games. If youve read the Hunger Games and loved that series you will love that book! This book was super interesting and I cannot wait till may for the sequal, Insurgent. more: I feel like answering a question I asked myself when I started reading. To which faction do I want to belong? I do want to belong to Dauntless. The people in this faction seem fearless almost fearless and I want to be like them. Only, I know I will never be like them. I think I belong to the Erudite. Intelligence means a lot to me. I would not fit into Candor because I lie to easily, and I do not belong to the Abnegation because I could never be as selfless as them. I do also not belong to Amity, they are never fighting, even when I think they should fight, they wont. They seem weak to me. the ending: I did have it all figured out before finishing the book. I figured out who Four really was. I figured out what would happen. But I did not care that I had it all figured out. It did not make this book less interesting. And there were still things that kept on surprising me : rating: this book gets 5 stars adoh and I will call this one of my favourites of 2011, what a great honour ;
A Right to Remain by Beth Rinyu 4 stars!! I realize now that my heart is big enough to hold love for more than one person. You gave me my happily, and he will give me my every after. A Right to Remain is a book that brings together a few of my favourite tropes all wrapped up into a highly addictive story that will keep you page turning from first to last page. First and foremost, this is a love story, a story of two characters that have their own heap of hurt to contend with and a new love is the furthest thing from their mind. Then you have that air of mystery and suspense that Beth Rinyu cleverly wove throughout culminating in a suspense filled ending that will have you wringing your hands in anticipation and hope. Sometimes we need to stop wasting time trying to mend the things in life that are beyond repair. Instead, we need to allow them to fall completely apart so we can start rebuilding them with a stronger foundation, and Lacey showed me how to do just that. She reconstructed the pieces of my heart, day by day, little by little, piece by piece, until it was finally whole once again. Quinn Lavery was a character that you cannot help but fall in love with. This man had a heart of gold and would do anything for anyone. He was a police officer and he was married but at the start of this book his marriage is failing and he and his wife are in counselling. Having experienced a tragic loss, Quinns wife did the unspeakable, rather than seek solace and comfort in the arms of her husband she chose to seek it in the arms of another, the ultimate betrayal. Quinn had never been enough for her, she had always been career and money oriented and honestly, their ideals and aspirations had just drifted apart. It is through counselling that Quinn realises his marriage is over. Lacey Sullivan had lost her husband in tragic circumstances and the scars from that event two years ago still haunt her to this day. Lacey decides a clean break in a new town is what she needs to try and heal and so she ups sticks and with her trusty companion they embark on a new life. They move miles and miles away, they rent a cabin and Lacey gets a job as a teacher. The cabin was quiet, on the edge of the woods and the setting was truly tranquil, the perfect environment to regroup and take stock of her life. Lacey meets her landlord sooner than she anticipates as he is living in the cabin above her. Following the breakdown of his marriage Quinn is living in one of his cabins and once introductions are made and initial insecurities and wariness are overcome a beautiful friendship soon follows. Lacey and Quinn have a lot in common. They have both loved hard and both lost. Both are grieving and coming to terms with the hand that they have been dealt and both of them soon seek solace in the words of the other. Their conversations bring wisdom, experience and clarity in muddy situations and both are a stepping stone to healing for the other. The growth of their friendship was beautiful to watch. Whereas Quinn once sought his answers at the bottom of the bottle, he now has Lacey to steer him right and whereas Lacey once internalised everything and kept everything bottled, she now has Quinn and therapy to open up and begin to mend those scars. Spending so much time together though blurs the lines of the friendship, but are these two ready to embark on love once again or will their pasts hold them back? If I had one thing to be thankful for this year, it would be for the girl who moved in downstairs from me a few months ago, the same one who with each passing day was moving slowly into my heart. The past always has a habit of infiltrating our present and for Lacey her past consists of painful memories and a lot of emotional scarring. It seems someone does not want to leave her past dead and buried and herein lies the mystery and suspense element of this story that keeps you on your toes while reading. Beth Rinyu cleverly weaves a story that will have you second guessing throughout. With secrets getting unearthed, revelations aplenty and a friend or foe mentality you never know who to trust. But the crux of this story remains the blossoming relationship between Quinn and Lacey and it was truly heartwarming. To see two people, mend their scars and take a second chance on love with one another was memorable and you couldnt help but champion these two along. They have a lot of mountains to climb and it seems that the world is against them but these two have longevity stamped all over them, they just need to believe in one and other. You make me feel alive when Im with you, and thats something I never dreamed would be possible again. I will say, there was one revelation that I didnt feel was necessary and when I came across it I kind of deflated and it was this one thing that really took the shine off of what was up until that point a fivestar book. Sometimes less is more and for me this plot twist wasnt warranted and just made me feel a bit yuck inside, I cant really explain it, but once you read it, you may or may not feel the same. However, it didnt detract from a fabulous read that I thoroughly enjoyed and for all you romantic suspense readers I am sure you will love this one too. www.theromancecover.com
This review also appears on Happy Indulgence. Check it out for more reviews! I am a massive fan of Sherlock the TV show. Its probably my favourite TV show ever. Im also a big fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle even though Ive only read a couple of the short stories and two of the novels. Therefore, A Study in Charlotte seemed like the perfect read for me because no Sherlock fan would say no to more Sherlock or Sherlockinspired stories. Sadly, I set my expectations a little bit too high and this book fell a little bit short for me. But first, lets talk about what I enjoyed about this book. This was by no means a bad book and lots of fans of Sherlock would love this and eat it right up. It has characters that will remind you of Sherlock and Watson, and for those of you going through Sherlock withdrawals, this will fill the gaping hole in your heart! It also has a wonderful mystery that references and incorporates some of the elements in Sir Arthur Conan Doyles original works that will have you dying to read the original stories. I also thought that it was wonderfully translated to a high school setting, and I enjoyed reading a modern, high school detective mystery that was reminiscent of a Sherlock Holmes story. My mum was cross with Milo for teasing me. He kept telling me Santa Claus was real. Im sorry, I asked, Was? Dont you mean wasnt? No. However, I had many problems with the execution of this book, especially the characterisation. For me, the characters of Charlotte Holmes and Jamie Watson too closely resembled Sherlock Holmes and John Watson for me to enjoy the book. Their mannerisms were similar, as was the relationship dynamic minus the romance, of course. The characters were so similar that Charlotte was a violinplaying chain smoker and drug user, much like Sherlock. Jamie is an aspiring writer who once wanted to be a doctor, like Dr. John Watson. There was just nothing unique or original about these characters for me and it felt like Cavallaro decided to just take some wellknown and wellloved characters and give them a high school setting, rather than develop her own characters. Just because Charlotte and Jamie are supposed to be descendants of Sherlock and John, it doesnt mean that they need to have the same habits, hobbies and personality. If this was an adaptation like the TV show, Id be totally fine with it. But this is a retellingreimagining and I needed the characters to not be the same as the originals. My other problem with the characters was that I found them very hard to connect with and I didnt particularly like either of them, which I found odd because I love both Sherlock and John Watson. I found Jamie to be extremely whiny, needy and dependent on Charlotte and her friendship, but his character did improve once he started becoming more useful. Charlotte was enigmatic and aloof and just difficult to relate to or connect with, especially because we dont get to read from her perspective. Her character was far too Manic Pixie Dream Girl for my liking. In addition to me not relating to Charlottes character, I thought it was ridiculous how far the author took Charlottes deductive reasoning abilities. Its one of Sherlocks quirks that most fans love, but in A Study in Charlotte, Charlotte just came across as psychic rather than extremely observant and logical. Half the time, there were no explanations given for how she came to certain conclusions and it was hard to suspend my disbelief. There were times when she tried to give explanations but was cut off by other characters who werent interested in her thought process. It came across to me as laziness on the authors part. Jamie and Charlottes friendshippartnership was a little bit strange for me. Jamie is pretty much obsessed with Holmes from the very beginning. He fantasises constantly about the adventures theyd go on if they were a detective pair. The book never goes into their history if they even had one besides being descendants of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, so I found it quite odd how quickly and randomly they became friends. The romance also came out of the blue for me and it was too abrupt. Overall, I didnt see any natural development in their relationship throughout the book. I also had some problems with the execution of the plot and the mystery. A Study in Charlotte definitely does not have the same precision, clarity and logic that the original Sherlock Holmes stories have. There were many things that were confusing to me as a reader. At a couple of points in the book, I had to flip back through the pages and check to make sure I hadnt missed any details. There were also mentions of important things that had happened or that the characters had done after the fact but these things werent shown earlier to the reader. Therefore, I thought that some of the things that we were told were just conveniently added in as they became necessary to the plot. Along the same lines, the epilogue written from Charlottes perspective, although I thought it was a nice touch, also seemed like a last minute addition to explain everything that might not have been clear or wellexplained in the novel. It was this kind of lazy writing that put me off the book a little bit. The story arc and the mystery for me was a little bit lacking. It wasnt as exciting and thrilling as I had expected it to be. There were many elements that were similar to the original stories so there was nothing that I found to be particularly shocking. The reveal at the end was not surprising for me at all and I didnt think it was particularly wellresolved. I did enjoy the story but it felt a little bit confused and I was disappointed with the execution of it. This wasnt a bad book by any means and it is probably a case of its not you, its me, but I was disappointed with A Study in Charlotte. I didnt think the characters were original, and the plot and mystery for me were underdeveloped, confused and slightly predictable, especially for a fan of Sherlock. I didnt think the novel was particularly wellexecuted and there were some elements that I thought were kind of lazy. However, I do plan to continue with the trilogy because I love detective stories and the high school setting worked well in A Study in Charlotte.
Not that this really needs to be said anyways because you can already see this above, but The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most solid fivestar ratings Ive ever given in my whole Goodreads career. And this review will be spoilery so if you dont want to know dont go past this point. And, again, my stupid computer shut down on me while I was writing this so now I have to rewrite this all again. Sigh. I got this book totally on coincidence. I was just browsing through Barnes and Noble, not really planning on buying anything, when I came upon three full shelves of The Fault in Our Stars. Even then, I wasnt really planning on buying it shame on me I know what was I even thinking but then I saw that one lone book on the shelf had a bright yellow sticker on it saying, signed by John Green! I opened the book to the front page and saw his signature in green ink. Enjoying the irony, I picked it up and decided to buy it; clutching it to my chest and carrying it up to the counter. And let me say that was one of the best literary decisions of my life. This is how I feel about this book in gif form, just let me tell you: Seriously; Im going to put it in a glass case on top of a red velvet pillow and honor it for all my days I dont really know what else to say besides that this book was amazing. Absolutely incredible. And, personally, I think it was because how close I am to death. My dad died when I was 15 of a sudden heart attack  Here is my review for a book called A Monster Calls that you should also read where I go more indepth about it, for those of you who didnt know, and so many things that Hazel and Augustus went through were reflected in me. The absolute hate she had for people who smoked; wasting perfectly good lungs when she basically had none is my distaste for people who dont take care of their hearts when one visit to a doctors office and a couple of small pills would save their life. When Augustus broke down and admitting that everything wasnt alright; that this wasnt fair, is something that Im still going through in my own life. When they held Augustus funeral in the bottom of the church and had a heartwrenching, grosssobbing, twistyourfaceintothemostdisgustingangelsandfeellikeyourowninsidesaretearingyouapartwhileyouscream mourning was the same thing I went through with my own friends a couple days after he died. And, like Hazel, that was more of my own person funeral for my father than his real one ever was. All of the facebook posts of people who didnt know Hazels Augusts just like they didnt know my father. When they both went to Germany and found out even the person you hold in the highest esteem, is practically untouchable by bad, turns out to disappoint you. The act of doing absolutely nothing important with a person that means everything. The Fault in Our Stars hit me at every emotional angle possible. Props to you, Green. And just the characters by themselves are just so unique and special in their own right, and it was a really tight tie between Hazel and Augustus as my favorite I mean come on that letter he wrote about her at the end ripped my heart out and spread it to the four corners of the earth, never to be seen again., but Hazel still won out just because of who she is. You knew who she was and what she stood for the minute you read her first paragraph in the book, and still kept her core beliefs throughout the novel, even though her perception did change, but whose wouldnt after meeting the man that is Augustus? I loved absolutely every single facet of her. She was the steady rock that guided me through Greens book. And this is all I have to say to her: And Augustus. Oh my baby Augustus. He is everything I never knew I wanted in a male character and more. He also gives a big thankyou from me for everything he did for me and for Hazel, and he was the storm that ruffled her life because, although she was a rock, she was too much of a rock, and he lifted her up so she could reach her full potential and not just keep sinking into the ground from her own weight. They were both just right for each other. And that letter that he wrote at the end had me going: But then I wanted it all at the same time. It was all too much for me. And the fact that they had sex? Just ugh. Thank you for that, John Green. And speaking of that man, his writing alone was like literary porn in a way that I couldnt stop reading it. Heres the first paragraphs: Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death. Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really. But my mom should be adjusted and also I should attend a weekly Support Group. This Support Group featured a rotating cast of characters in various states of tumordriven unwellness. Why did the cast rotate? A side effect of dying. The Support Group, of course, was depressing as hell. It met every Wednesday in the basement of a stonewalled Episcopal church shaped like a cross. We all sat in a circle right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would have met, where the heart of Jesus would have been. I noticed this because Patrick, the Support Group Leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked about the heart of Jesus every freaking meeting, all about how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in Christs very sacred heart and whatever. So heres how it went in Gods heart: The six or seven or ten of us walked wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didnt die and now here he is, a fullgrown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way slowly working his way toward a masters degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life. AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY! Justjust let me hug you, John Green. And the plot is enjoyable, simple, but complex enough that youre still not exactly sure where its going, but that actually excites you. You want it just the way it is. I would not change a single word of the whole book. And, okay, did anyone else think that it was just going to end abruptly like the book inside the book did? Because I sure as hell thought so, and although I still love the ending and would never change it, I was almost disappointed that didnt happen somehow. I cant be the only one that was thinking that, can I? Anyway, this was an incredible book, as per usual for our John Green, and I will treasure if for years to come I wasnt joking about putting it in a glass case, people. And I suppose I will see you all at the next book that makes me cry, an event I look forward to and dread.
full review now and not just my late night ramblings Lets just say I stayed up late to finish the last 100 pages and now I cant wait for my turn to come up on the winter hold list at my library!!!! Luckily I have Fairest and Stars Above sitting on my nightstand to fill the time until I reach the top of the longummm were talking about 15 people and only a couple copies in a smallish community list...oh the agony. I know you all know what Im talking about. Kinda like when each new Harry Potter book came out, you stood in line late at night my husband actually was more ecstatic than me and went while I stayed home with sleeping kids and then you just had to start reading you waited long enough to get the book. But in my case you had to take turns reading it... I had it for a chapter then my husband. Oh it was torturous! You just want to open the cover and be engrossed in the story from start to finish but you have to close the cover and be patient...not easy at all. So here is me being patient with all the other readers ahead of me waiting for winter and sending out a plea to themPlease read fast. ; Ill write the rest of my review tomorrow, for now Im going to bed! After a late night and way too early morning Im writing my thoughts so if theyre jumbled and confusing forgive me, Im suffering from post late night reading hangover. Why oh why do we do that to ourselves? I havent done that in a long time but last night it was the end of the book and I just had to find out what happened...I needed answers only to have another cliffhanger. Which I knew was coming but as I said earlier Im going to be waiting a while for Winter so I probably could have waited for daylight to finish reading but sometimes you just need to lose yourself in a book! Cress is tied with Cinder for being my favorite in the series so far. There were a few slower moving parts, or that could just have been my busy schedule and exhausted brain trying to piece it all together, especially when you only read a paragraph at a time then have to pause for hours. All the great characters converge in this one and more is revealed about certain characters. Plus, Im going out on a limb here, one of the characters dies! Im not shedding any tears over who it is so dont stress its none of the main characters. Although there are several pretty intense moments in the plot where you arent sure if theyre going to succeed in their attempts to thwart the wedding between Kai and Queen Levana or if theyll all end up captured. Cinder is still trying to come to terms with being Lunar and trying to make sacrifices for Earth and her people of Luna. I love the chapters from her point of view. She has struggles that make her a normal humancyborg. Who do you sacrifice for the greater good, or do you just drop it all and save yourself and friends? Cress and Thorne end up having an adventure separate from everyone. Just when I feel that I have Thorne figured out he goes and does something or says something to contradict that. Then later on he again does something that contradicts the earlier contradiction. So the question is, who is Thorne really and what is the act and what is the true character? Cress is wonderful, shes quickly becoming one of my favorite characters. After being trapped in a satellite for 7 years and trapped underground before that shes a little socially awkward and she has some pretty big insecurities. I mean who wouldnt when your life was lived trapped on a satellite in a small space with no human interaction. I love how to compensate she imagines whatever stressful event is occurring is a pretend moment and that she is acting a part to help her get through said stressful moment. I think in life several of us probably do that to some extent and in certain moments. I enjoy acting, and playing a character is definitely less vulnerable than showing your true self and being hurt. Although I prefer being myself and hoping others enjoy that more than a front. ; We do learn something new about Cress and her origins but I dont want to reveal that although Im pretty sure most of you already have guessed what. Cress and Thorne are a great couple. I loved their interactions and the promise he makes her and then waiting for that fulfillment to happen. sigh All the romance throughout is clean and no language so that makes this an even bigger plus for me to recommend and read myself. Scarlet and Wolf at the end of Scarlet have decided that she is his Alpha and boy oh boy are you in for a crazy plot shift between these two and repercussions and Lunar craziness. Im a no spoiler kinda gal and so thats all I will say because if I describe much more then youll not be surprised, just know its coming and that Wolf definitely lives up to his name. Finally Cinder and Kai! The interaction between them in this book is pretty much nil but its what you all have been waiting for...the moment of truth. Will Kai be able to look past the lies and the cyborg and lunar heritage and everything else that has come between them? Will they ever meet again? Will Cinder be able to stop the wedding? Will Earth be stuck with an evil empress? Will the letumosis plague ever be eradicated? Will all the characters survive or be torn apart through torture and capture and death? Oh one last thing, theres a new character...well not really new hes been in the first two books but watch out for him and how hes connected and good luck trying to figure out whos side hes on! Winter here I come... Happy Reading!!!
6 Stars!!! In love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are. WOW...Just WOW! This is one BEAUTIFUL book. Ive got ugly tears running down my face right now. I just love this quote and it beautifully and succinctly summarizes this book. For almost a year, Ive heard so much buzz about this book, but somehow I couldnt get myself to read it...maybe because of the historical background. Well, there is a lot of war in this book, but this book is so much more than war. This is a story about humanity and how far we will go to save a stranger. It is a story about family and love. It is an empowering story about the inner strength and endurance of women. It is HEARTWRENCHING! It looks at society and how peoples fear can cloud sound judgment. It asks the hard questions of how far will we go to protect our loved ones? How much can we take before we break? This book follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, and their struggles during World War II. Although sisters, they are not friends. Abandoned by their father at an early age, both struggle to find love, acceptance, and their place in life. As the war comes to France, Vianne and Isabelle find their strength and learn to survive the war. They both grow throughout the process and make their mark on the war. Im not a history buff, but after reading this novel and knowing that Kristin Hannah was inspired by true stories, I am completely in awe and want to learn more about this time period. This book is so wonderful and I have so many emotions running through me right now. Im not sure how to write this review. I guess Ill just tell you about how this book will make you feel and what I hope youll gain from this book. Ill be honest...it took me awhile to really get into the book. Dont get me wrong, the entire book is good, but I wasnt hooked until about 30 so keep reading if you are unsure about this book. At this point I just became so invested in their story and what it must have been like to live through WWII. I was so engrossed in the story; I was emotionally in sync with Vianne and Isabelle. I felt myself trudging along and trying to be strong just like Vianne and Isabelle. Only until the end did I relax and allow myself to grieve for all of their loss. Im grieving and reminiscing on their journey. It is now at the end of the book that I can fully appreciate this story and all the beauty and wisdom it has to offer. Vianne and Isabelle are very different characters. Isabelle is naive, impetuous, and freespirited. In contrast, Vianne is older, wiser, and more responsible and cautious in life. However, both sisters are insecure and flawed in their own way. Each sister takes their own path in the war. Both have their own crises and question ethics, morals, and how to live a meaningful life. They make mistakes, hurt people, and they are both pushed to their breaking pointthey find out who they really are and what they are willing to sacrifice to make a better world. Their growth is beautiful to watch. I could only hope I would do the same in their situation. Dont think about who they are. Think about who you are and what sacrifices you can live with and what will break you. I found myself liking Isabelle more than Vianne which is interesting since I am more like Vianne in real life. I admired Isabelle so much. Her strength and courage was amazing. But as Vianne began to grow and mature, I really started to like her character as well. It was a proud moment when she realizes what she must to do live with herself in the war. She knew now that no one could be neutralnot anymoreand as afraid as she was of risking Sophies life, she was suddenly more afraid of letting her daughter grow up in a world where good people did nothing to stop evil, where a good woman could turn her back on a friend in need. There are so many wonderful messages and lessons in this book. How do we pick up the pieces and move on from such terror? How do we survive such hate? How do we overcome such evil? But love has to be stronger than hate, or there is no future for us. This story emphasizes that our ability to love is one of the most powerful forces. Love keeps the spirit alive. It has the potential to heal, to build and rebuild the future for us. It emphasizes the strength in us women and how we piece it all together and move the future along. It makes me so proud to be a woman. They couldnt touch my heart. They couldnt change who I was inside. My body...they broke that in the first days, but not my heart, V. The story also touches on our need for love and belonging. Isabelle, Vianne, and their father have a strained relationship. No matter how much they try to resist needing one another, their bond and need to be loved by one another is strong and everlasting. A girls love for her father. Immutable. Unbearable but unbreakable. Its a story that emphasizes forgiveness, to live in the moment, and to appreciate and love one another while we are alive. The story has tragedy pervading every scene. Its a realistic story of grief and loss. I like happy endings because I know in life sometimes there are no happy endings. Books are my escape. This story doesnt have a bad ending, just a realistic one that breaks my heart. Some stories dont have happy endings. Even love stories. Maybe especially love stories. However, despite all the loss and grief, there is a silver lining. While the book reminds us that even though not all endings are happy, the life lived and how we lived is what matters. Its the memories and the love found that carry us through. I know now what matters, and it is not what I have lost. It is my memories. Wounds heal. Love lasts. This book will touch your heart and soul. It will make you want to be strong. It will make you feel proud to be a woman. It will make you want to love harder and be better. It is a story of strength, love, courage, and sacrifice. This is a MUST read!!
I couldnt wait to finally hold this book in my hands ever since BookRiot recommended it  I even waited 3 weeks longer just so I could have the original edition! And I wasnt disappointed. The layout alone is heartwarming with the cover being in 3 different colours, doodles on the inside of the cover, nice rainbowcolored letters spelling the title on the book jacket and this dedication: For You, For When You Felt Different The story is about a boy named George who wants nothing more than to play Charlotte in his schools play of Charlottes Web. The fact that a powerful, beautiful and very important childrens book is the driving element for the progression of the story already hints to greatness to come. Anyway, George wants to play Charlotte but is told by his teacher that its a part for girls. Two notes here: 1. I really wanted to like Georges teacher, especially after how she reacted to some boys making fun of George when he cried. However, I quickly ended up resenting her! I hate gender labels and I hate when children are being prevented from having a great experience books, movies, clothes, theme parks, whatever because its for insert gender. Even more so when these expressions come from people who claim to be ohsoopenandincluding. And her justification that there are so many girls that are trying out for the part was simply phony it was obvious from the start that Kelly would get the part . Moreover, she didnt behave well after the play  the principle had to shut her down! ARG! 2. Particularly in a play it doesnt matter what sex the actor has  in times of old, only men were actors, making it necessary to have men play both Romeo AND Juliet as it was pointed out in this book too! clears throat End of rant. Naturally, this is quite a problem for George who is already very shy and has no idea how to put feelings into words. Even more tragic is that George has a very good and special REASON for wanting to play Charlotte: hes not a boy. He is a she. Stuck in the wrong body, hoping the entire world will finally see her for who she really is and accept that being a girl in the wrong body isnt actually bad, George thinks playing Charlotte will open everybodys eyes. Before starting this book, Ive read a couple of reviews here on GR and have to make some statements regarding two very bad ones and their arguments: It was stated that this book was bad because although it was for childrenYA, it would be too confusing for the target group what with Georges description of herself instead of himself. My only reaction: SERIOUSLY?! First of all, kids can handle far more than adults give them credit for  a conversation authors like J.K. Rowling and Cornelia Funke constantly have with overprotective parents. Secondly, there might be a child or two being confused at first but this detail gives the perfect opportunity for parents to teach their children to accept the gender speech chosen by the respective individual and not social norms  what you think is or should be correct. George feels like a girl so OF COURSE its she and herself and not he  himself! Its not all that difficult, really. But here we are, this is one of the major problems in the whole transgenderdiscussion: people being too stuck in drawers, having to label everything according to old norms instead of just opening their minds and hearts. Another point raised was some unrealistic dialogue by George and her best friend Kelly when considering the age of the children. While I see which passages were probably meant, I also have to say that especially Kelly seemed to be precocious a bit like Hermione but without the books in general and George simply was the one affected. That is not unrealistic at all. Moreover, it was only one or two lines. I just wanted to address these issues in case people were also browsing through the reviews like I did, coming across these two particular ones and therefore being turned away from the book  because that would be a huge loss! On the other hand, there were so many quirky and funny moments in this book like when George was in the bathroom with all her magazines, her brother wanted to go to the bathroom so George had to hide them quickly while having a panic attack and shortly later Scott asked if George was having fun with magazines in the bathroom which prompted George to freak out even more although Scott clearly meant something entirely different. or the entire conversation when George finally told Scott at that allyoucaneat restaurant and Scotts reaction. lol Most of the funny moments were also cute andor heartbreaking and more than once I simply wanted to hug George. The things that moved me the most: 1. When Georges damned mother reacted to the magazines like that. I mean, yeah, maybe some people need more time to deal with finding out their child is LGBTQ which already is bad enough since this isnt about THEM, but the way she treated George DAYS AFTERWARDS?! . 2. After I thought it couldnt get worse, Georges mother finally talked to her, finding out that George wasnt gay but a girl and said THE WORST LINE EVER! I wanted to punch her. Ad infinitum. Yeah, Im still so mad, Im even switching to Latin! 3. The school incident. I mean, how can they treat George the way they do?! Because of the paint on the shirt? After having to endure so much from this bully, shes being sort of punished for stepping up?! OK, technically she was destroying property BUT HE PUNCHED HER! He punched her so hard she had to vomit even! This was done to me once when I was about 9 years old so I know the pain, I know the fear, I know the shame and trust me, you dont need this shit from teachersprinciples later! The only consolation was that the principle let her off easy. 4. After the school play when Georges mother behaved in THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE  seriously, how heartless can a human being be, especially considering that this is HER CHILD?!  but the principle stepped up and saved George with an epic statement. Yay toMrs. Maldonado! And no, surprised was not how the mother reacted, no matter what she says later. There it is again  me wanting to punch that woman. Apart from transidentity and how to come out, this book also deals with friendship, bullying, the school system and how it responds or doesnt to challenging situations as a system as well as individual teachers. All of the topics are being described in a beautiful but simple way that also makes it very easy to explain them to children. Moreover there are very subtle, somtimes metaphorical elements, making this a book anyone can enjoy and reread to maybe discover new things depending on how old you are each time. There was one thing that left a sour taste in my mouth however and that was the fact that one could argue George comes from a broken home parents divorced, father living with another woman somewhere else and that that is the reason for her confusion. Of course its bullshit but people are constantly trying to explain transidentityhomosexuality away like that and a book such as this shouldnt give them such ammunition. Im all for diversity and think that the media can and should play a vital part in making these stories become normal. I think there are currently definitely not enough books about young members of the LGBTQ community. Hopefully this will change also thanks to pioneer books such as this! The message I took away from this reading experience: friends make everything better. I was very moved by George and would definitely read this towith my kids. A wholehearted recommendation to everyone!
Before I begin this review, I have a few things I should note. One; the hype surrounding this book had me wary upon reading it as I didnt want to be one of the only people disliking it. Two; I am probably what you call a harsh critic and giving five stars to a book isnt something I do for just any book. And finally three; I received this book from the Read 2 Review section of the Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy Fanatics group on goodreads in return for an honest review. With that said, can I just say that this book is an absolutely glorious read! I loved it from the first page to the very last page and hated myself when I had to put it down. Its difficult to know where to start with this review as I dont want to miss anything out, or give too much away! I think Ill start by describing just how the book grabbed my attention. Its not often I come across a book that fully manages to grab me by my ankles and transport me to somewhere completely different but this book definitely did. Id loved how the book initially started out, with the bird on the window and the powerful imagery that it left throughout the rest of the book. I adored how in two pages the author had already told you so much about Alexas personality and really managed to get the readers attention. It was cleverly written and I just loved it. Alexa is such a brilliant character. She is so real. Shes strong and brave and powerful but shes also weak, emotional and flawed and I simply love that about her. She doesnt feel like she can save everything, she feels like she wants to. She knows her strength but at the same time, she doesnt really. It is this conflicting parts to her personality that truly make her feel like a realistic character. She is easy to understand and find sympathy with and I just felt myself wanting to follow her on her journey, to point her in the right direction and to give her the comfort that she needed. I also found it easy to relate to her as she had some very similar characteristics to myself which I always love when I read a book. Nelly was also adored by me, I wanted to reach in through the pages and soak her up in a bear hug. She was just as wellwritten and realistic as Alexa and that is just another good reason why Gordon deserves all the praise that has been coming her way lately. I loved Kayden. Absolutely, heartwrenching in my chest, loved him. He was so... guarded and he had been through so much and all he wanted was to help but he didnt know how and just... ugh... amazing. Really well written, and I loved that you really got a feel for his character even though the book was written in the point of view of Alexa. There were times I understood him and wanted to scream at her to get it as well. That just showed how good Gordon is at writing a story that truly captures the reader. Further adding to the writing skills, the world that Gordon created was so imaginative and brilliant that I was simply enthralled. The different races were so interesting to read about and to witness. The way the city ran and the way that things flowed throughout the book was just so wellthoughtout that I just loved it. I was reading with newfound eyes, wanting to soak up the world and to find out as much about the world as I could. I loved how the information wasnt thrown too much at you at once. It was given to you piece by piece, just as Alexa herself was getting to grips with it, so were you. It was just, brilliantly done and filled me with awe. Emotional. That is definitely a word I would use to describe the ending of this book. Emotional and catchy. All I want to do now is pick up the next book in this series and devour it from front to back because I am certain that it will be as good, if not better, then the first in the series. I want to know what is going to happen, I want to know where the story is going, where it will all end up, and I want to know right now. I also want to continue reading a story that has amazing and skilful writing that I can lose myself on the page. A few things that did annoy me was Tommy, he just got on my nerves quite a bit and I didnt feel that his character was really needed in the story. Although, the scenes between Jackson and Tommy were nice to see, I just didnt see what it really added to the main arc of the story but then again, that did sort of come to light at the end but I just didnt particularly like him I suppose. Aside from this, however, finding things I didnt like about the story is hard. I simply adored it and cannot wait to continue reading. I would recommend this book to any young adult or adult readers who enjoy fantasy novels with some good old vampires and werewolves and hidden cities and pageturning plots with just brilliantly written words.
Continuing on my trend of reading the super hyped and popular books late, I finally read Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo and the sequel too but shhh the review is coming later. And let me just say, wow! I now understand why these books are so loved by the whole book blogging community. The writing is superb, the characters are precious, and the plot is so fast paced and intriguing, with tons of twists and turns, and an overall theme of darkness. No mourners. No funerals. This book centers around a group of fugitives, thieves, assassins, and witches as they try to do the impossible: break into the impenetrable Ice Court and retrieve a hostage. Now that I look back on it, that really is the main plot in the book, but that doesnt mean the story is straightforward. Far from it. While the plot is actionpacked, this really is a character driven story, which Ill talk about later on. The relationships in this story between all the different crew members shift and change and are a main focus of the story as well. Now one of the main misconceptions I had before reading was that the crew was going to become this group of best friends, where they all trust each other with their secrets and protect each other 100. This is false. Most of the crew hates each other in the beginning, and there really is only one pairing of best friends. They all grudgingly respect each other, and throughout the story begin to protect each other with their own lives, even if it is only because they recognize that the other person is a necessary part of their operation, but they never become the secret whispering, best friend group that I had pictured. A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who has become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse. That being said, I absolutely loved all the characters, although I had my issues with some of them. They were not the noble, honest, obviously good characters, but dark, twisted, tormented, and murky characters. Theres Kaz Brekker, the leader of the operation. Hes cruel and calculating, but a mastermind and fearless. Next is Inej, the Wraith or the spider of the group. Shes tiny, silent, and deadly, but also faithful and optimistic and observant and also one of my favorite characters. We have Jesper, the sharpshooter of the crew. Hes goofy, lighthearted, and has a penchant for gambling, but ultimately is loyal to his crew and brings laughter when they are on the brink of death. Theres Wylan, the baby of the group. Hes used as the bargaining coin, but has other skills such as creating bombs. The fifth member of the group is Nina my other favorite character. Shes flirty, fearless, and magical. Literally, she has magic powers that let her control peoples breathing and pulse and emotions. But shes also loyal, honest, and loving, bringing humanity to her. The last member is Matthias, an exmilitary man and escaped fugitive. He is the brute force of the operation, as well as the actual trained killer. Together, these six characters make for a deadly group. As I said earlier, Nina and Inej are my favorite characters. They both have the most heart, in my opinion, and the ability to actually care for someone else. They are fearless and strong, but understand that emotions are not a weakness. Their friendship is also one of the most heartwarming parts of the book. They are friends not only for survival, but because their personalities mesh together and they understand each other. Sometimes, theyd be on the brink of death, or about to embark on a deadly mission, and their conversation would still bring a smile to my face because of the obvious love they have for each other and the comfort they feel around each other. There was no part of him that was no broken, that had not healed wrong, and there was no part of him that was not stronger for having been broken. I have some issues with Kaz, because of how cruel he is, and how he almost seems to have no conscience. As the book goes on, he becomes more human, but he still is so cold and calculating, never letting himself give in to the emotions he is feeling or show mercy. I understand, they are basically fighting for their lives throughout the book, so mercy would be poorly placed, but there are times when he shouldve forgiven easier and sooner, or given second chances. That being said, I can appreciate him for the mastermind he is, and can respect his mind and how he is able to put together almost impossible schemes and operations to achieve his goals. His dedication to a cause is extraordinary. My last note about the characters before I move on is how diverse their crew is. There are physically disabled characters, many different races and religions represented, a couple members of the LGBTQIA community, and some mental limitations represented. Im sure Im forgetting some of the diversity represented, but honestly it was so great to see these characters so different from each other in such a natural way, and so real. Next in this super long review is my raving about the world building. It was just superb. Each nation was given an identity, and the entire city of Ketterdam, with its rival gangs, felt as much a part of the story as the actual plots and characters did. Plus, all the rivalries felt real and deep, not just thrown in there for drama. But my main example of the amazing world building done is the Grisha. Bardugo basically created a race of humans with magical abilities, so obviously there was a lot of information that needed to be disclosed about them, including about the people that hunt them down and kill them. Also, apparently her other series is a whole Grisha series?! Whaaaaaat?!. But all the information felt seamlessly woven into the story, so there was never a large info dump paragraph that disrupted the flow of the story. The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true. And then theres the romance. As we all know, Im a huge fan of romance, and the romance between Nina and Matthias was perfectly written. It never overtook the story, but was developed all the same. It shows how complex love can be, and how love requires compromise. They are now one of my favorite ships in a YA book, just because of how real it felt to me also they are one of my favorite tropes. And thats it with this super rave review! When I was going into the story, I did not expect to love it as wholeheartedly as I did, but I could not put this book down. Everything about it is so masterfully done that it deserves five stars.
Bright Side by Kim Holden 5 breathtaking stars!!! Today, my life is awesome. This book is up there on my favourite reads of 2014, hell even up there on my favourite reads of ALL TIME! Yes it is seriously that good. This is a book that I couldnt put down, not for one measly second. Once I started I couldnt stop and once I had finished I was completely and utterly devastated. I was not ready for this book to end, I just wanted more. The writing style is fluid, beautiful, emotional, captivating, gut wrenching, all encompassing, this book takes you over, heart, mind, body and soul. The heroines motto in this book is DO EPIC and Kim Holden has DONE EPIC. This book is EPIC, do not be dissuaded by an innocuous cover, in fact this is a prime example of never judge a book by its cover, what is inside this cover is exquisite and deserves to be read, to be devoured and to be inhaled. This book is like an emotional vortex, it sucks you in, drowns you in emotions and feels and doesnt let you free until the end. Have I said that this book is EPIC!! One more point on the cover though, once you have read the book you will appreciate its symbolism, I can see why the author did it and I can appreciate it whole heartedly. Just please, if you have a few spare dollarspounds, pick up this book, you will not regret it. This is one emotional book, it is devastating but it is devastatingly perfect, but and this is a big but it is perfectly balanced with humour, wit an addictive storyline and some amazing characters. Not one character is superfluous to the story, they all have their part in bringing this story together. Kate aka as Bright Side lives up to her nick name, she always looks on the bright side of life cue Monty Python music. She has had a really crap upbringing but she has never let it get to her. She has made the most of the crap that life has dealt her and is one of these people that puts everybody first. She is intelligent and super talented but all her aspirations were put on hold when life dealt her a hand that forced her to put those dreams aside for the time being. Kate was a beautiful character inside and out, she was adorable, selfless, giving, trusting, infectious, you couldnt help but smile and be happy in her company. She had the knack of bringing the shyest person to life, her personality shone like the sun, everyone she touched felt her, she radiated, she really was Bright Side. Her saving grace in life has been her best friend and neighbour Gus. I cant let the bad consume me or it would eat me whole. The bad stays in the bad corner of my mind, I dont let it through the door to mingle with good, because the bad is a goddamn party pooper. Gus was adorable, he was the epitome of the perfect best friend. These two loved each other unconditionally, the lines of friendship having been blurred once these two were firmly putting their best friends label first even though at times you knew, ideally in another world, another scenario that these two were meant to be together. They were more than best friends. Gus was a guitarist and singer in a band, Kate was his muse, they batted off each other, her being musically oriented as well meant that these two made beautiful music together. Kate was shy so she just remained in the back ground, but all she wanted in life was for Gus to succeed and she would push him all the way. Gus needed his best friend, he needed the push and she was always there for him, just like he was for her. The story starts with Kate tackling one of her bucket list items, she always wanted to go to University, finally life had changed enough to make this possible and we see her start University life with a flourish. She picks her friends wisely, brings life, love and laughter to all she meets. This is where she meets Keller. Keller was another lost soul, his own history already leaving its mark. Having never opened his heart up it is unsurprising that Kate manages to break down his walls and defences. Kate is reticent to jump into a relationship, preferring to keep to just friends but there is something about Keller, he makes her feel, he makes her want to push her reservations aside, he makes her take the leap. These two were truly beautiful together and Keller embraced her friendship with Gus...eventually. I didnt do anything. It was there all along, you just had to find it. And that is all I can say about this book...if I say anymore it will give too much away and that would be a travesty. All I can say is please, please read this book, give this newbie author a chance. Let the emotion and feels take you away for those few hours, learn some life lessons, be inspired, you will laugh, you will cry, you will swoon, but most of all you will feel. This is one book that has left its indelible mark on my heart, a book that I will champion from now on. Only a few books have made that impact and I am glad to add another to that list. I dont know if the speed limit in California is 95 miles an hour, because I realize you guys probably do things a little different there, but its only 65 here, which is about how fast you take fking corners. Kim Holden, all I can say is you are EPIC, this book is something that you should be truly proud of. I totally and utterly loved it and will now be eagerly anticipating your next book. Go and 1click peeps, you will not be disappointed. www.theromancecover.com

I was actually a little worried I mean everybody and their grandma loved this book and gave it at least 5 stars! Beside that I wasnt exactly a HUGE fan of Bardugos Shadow and Bone, while I didnt hate it I wasnt crazy about it either. So needless to say I thought I might not like her newest bookseries. While I cannot give this book the full 5 star rating that most people have given it I can say it was still a great read, I did have some complaints though. I think it might just be a problem I have with Bardugos writing because I feel like some of the same problems I had withShadow and Bone are apparent for me in Six of Crows as well. One more note is that you CAN read this book without reading the Grisha trilogy! Although I will say it helps out a little, just reading Shadow and Bone gave me a better grip on understanding terms and such. Shall We Talk About The Plot? Im going to start off by saying my favorite part about this book was the plot. Six criminals pulling off an impossible heist? Heck yes! I love heist stories, I cant get enough of them. Six of Crows definitely delivered that. The entire planning aspect of said heist was a lot of fun, I loved reading how these guys were going to make the impossible, possible. This book has been advertised as a cross between Game of Thrones and Oceans Eleven, it definitely has elements of both. Although I think its leaning a little more towards Oceans Eleven , actually its JUST like Oceans Eleven. I think most days EVERY new fantasy book gets slapped with the Like Game of Thrones label. The only thing that was remotely Game of Thronesesque was the multiple POVs and some plot twists. However, good shocking plot twists are not exclusive to Game of Thrones. Point made. Anyways! I loved the worldbuilding in this book, whereas Shadow and Bone was very fantasylite I feel Six of Crows has ten times that depth. We actually learn about the separate countries, cultures, and languages. THIS is how you do fantasy worldbuilding. There was TONS of diversity as well, we had characters with a lot of different skin shades and belief systems. I loved it. SO MUCH FANTASY CULTURE. Also even though this is marketed as YA it felt surprisingly more adultlike. Theres definitely YA elements and I myself would label it that but there were some pretty dark moments that made me question what genre I was reading. In a good way, of course! I mean after all you are reading a book about a bunch of criminals and criminals they most definitely are. The overall pacing of the book is very fast, its a pretty big book after all and didnt really take all that long to finish. Thats how quickly I was turning pages. Theres SO MUCH action, I couldnt go to sleep because I just wanted to keep reading. Also theres a pretty cliffhanger ending, so if youre not up for that.....now you know. Now Lets Talk About The Characters: I freaking adored every single one, they were developed incredibly well. They all had such great depth to their personalities, I couldnt believe it. Bardugo managed to craft excellent characters in just one book. Theyre all badass criminals but theres also so much more to them than that. Each character has a POV int his book minus Wylan, no idea why though and they have flashbacks throughout the book to help us get background on their pasts. I loved this element in the story, learning about what drives each of these characters to do what they do. It helps you feel so much more attached to characters when you know where they came from and what theyve been through. Seriously, Bardugo did an OUTSTANDING job writing these characters. I could sit here and gush about them all day. But....The Romance: Please excuse me while I rant and use some curse words..... I hated how EVERY SINGLE FUCKING CHARACTER HAD TO BE PAIRED UP FOR A ROMANCE. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Theres six main characters thus the books title and each of them was GAGA over one of the others. Sure one of the pairs isnt as outright as the other two pairs but its still definitely there and noticeable. I HATED IT. Like really? Cant we just have great characters that like being their own person and dont NEED another one of the characters? Can we? No? Like excuse me for not wanting a huge love fest in the middle of my heist book. A lot of people say the romance did not take over the book at all and I beg to differ. While you can still read this book for the heist and action and have a good time, I found all of the romances to be a bit distracting. I hate romance driven books for the most part and Im just not a fan of having that many going on in one book at one time. This is why I didnt like Shadow and Bone I hated the romances even though I loved the characters. So I think its safe to say that I just dont like Bardugos writing when it comes to romances. Basically it all boils down to I thought the sheer amount of romances was completely unnecessary. I did NOT need all of my main characters trying to romance and flirt with each other. In Conclusion: I loved it far more than I thought I would, this is a book that really lives up to all of its hype. Even if you didnt really love Leigh Bardugos other book Shadow and Bone like me I still think you should give this one a try. Ill definitely be returning for the sequel! Recommend? Yes, yes, yes. As I said earlier you do NOT have to read the Grisha trilogy before this book! So go ahead and read this book now!
This review can also be found on A Thousand Lives Lived, check it out for more! 4.5 star rating This four point five star rating I am handing Heidi Heiligs debut timetraveling adventure romance add in whatever genre you can think of and this book has it is not exactly what it seems like. Honestly? Forget about that four point five and picture this book as a perfect ten. The Girl From Everywhere was mystical, dashing, magical, stunning and just ohsogood, unlike my initial expectations. PEOPLE. I find that its better to expect the worst than the best, even in reality. I initially expected a boring, ununderstandable read for me with this one, but I flew through it in a sitting, and after it was over, I picked up my library copy and held it against my heart. I get a little cheesy when I like a book so much. Oh, and why should you treat this as a perfect rating? Because the book was practically perfect. I will touch on a minor thing that set me off from granting this five stars, but it barely affected me in any manner. By the way, I just noticed the girl in the water on the cover of this book after reading. I LOVE THOSE SURPRISES. Thats megacool. The Girl From Everywhere has such a perfect title for the 443 pages that are stamped inside of this beautiful cover. It explains our heroine, Nix, so well. Im so giddy with this book that I dont even know where my review should really begin. This is definitely one of the best books Ive read this year, and perhaps ever. I cannot fangirl about it more than I already have and will. For some reason, I expected this to be bad. Why? Because in the past, I have never enjoyed books about timetraveling mixed with historical events and myths. Okay, first of all, myths are rarely incorporated into YA these days, so thats a first... or second. Heidi Heilig writes about something thats deep in her heart, and I bet that she is seriously passionate about: Hawaiian culture. HOLY LEIS AND PINEAPPLES. I love Hawaii, I want to go there so bad. I mean, I always wanted to fly to the island of Oahu, be leied or whatever they call it, yell Ohana means family and say Aloha to every person I meet there. But now? This book introduced Hawaiian culture to me and it was so interesting to read about the most gorgeous islands in the world... back in the day, specifically in the nineteenth century. HOW DOES HEIDI DO EVERYTHING PERFECTLY? Theres so much diversity in The Girl From Everywhere that I cannot stop squealing. We have Kashmir HOLY I LOVE HIM, ILL GET TO HIM SOON, who is from Persia when Nix and her father, Slate, find him, and theres also Bee, who is African. Bees a crew member on The Temptation, the ship that Nix and her father timetravel or Navigate with. Shes lesbian too, which shows us how DEDICATED this book is. I loved reading about each and every place that Nix Navigated to, including New York City and how she retold events from the past when they went to Scandia and how they saw dragons in the Baltic Sea. It was only the nervous shifting of his eyes that hinted at discomfort, but not with the city, nor with being on land. With his own skin. No matter where we went, he never felt at home. I recognized that feeling. Id inherited it 35. Basically, The Girl From Everywhere is about our heroine, Nix, whose mother died when she gave birth to her. Her father, who is the captain of the ship that they, among others, timetravel, or Navigate with, called The Temptation, has never gotten over the fact that his true love is gone. He and Nix travel through time using maps that they find, going back centuries or millenniums into the past. Now, they are on the search for Nixs mother back in the past in Honolulu, Hawaii. That scares Nix, because she knows that she could possibly disappear if they do find her. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole novel. Although its about five hundred pages long, I couldnt stop reading from the moment I began the story. Heidi Heilig writes so casually, yet absolutely lyrically and different, perhaps more poetic than I wouldve expected. I loved everything about this story, how it teaches readers about culture, myth and the beautiful parts of loving life. I wish that I could GRAB ALL OF THE MAPS AND NAVIGATE MYSELF. Its a different twist on timetravel, and its for a good reason. You see, I always need some kind of description of the gears of timetraveling in a book I read. Thats so important for me. Heilig did not infodump on us, making up some weird explanations for why what Nix and her father do works. It was brief, yet unimaginable because no author has ever explored a bookish world like Heidi had. I dont understand the issues people had with this glorious story. It was racing, perfectly paced, and now? My life depends on the sequel. Honestly, a sequel isnt needed because the story ended off perfectly and we readers could imagine a continuing ending that works, but THERE IS ONE COMING AND DAMN, I NEED IT. I NEED HARPERCOLLINS TO SEND ME A COPY ASAP. ILL TAKE A MANUSCRIPT THATS ALL WRITTEN OVER, IF THATS WHAT IT TAKES. Or, I could ask my favourite couple, Nix and Kashmir, to personally deliver it. twiddles eyebrows Nix is your dream definition of a heroine. I loved her personality, and how she dealt with the situation she was in. She had every right to be confused and feel discomfort with her life, because she was taken away from what was supposed to be her future. It was interesting for us to get a firsthand look at the life she wouldve had if her father hadnt began Navigating for Nixs mother in the past, in nineteenth century Hawaii. She wasnt one of those protagonists who hated everyone around her for unexplainable reasons, you know? I found myself totally relating to her wanderlust, and NOW I WANT TO TRAVEL. People with severe wanderlust, this book is for you to take a trip with. Paradise is a promise no god bothers to keep. Theres only now, and tomorrow nothing will be the same, whether we like it or not 390. KASHMIR AND BLAKE. Guys, we have a slight love triangle here, but unless youre really affected by them, youll be fine. Blake is a character we are introduced to halfway through the novel, and he is living in the Hawaii that Nix visits with The Temptation. He hides this secret that he is also a mapmaker, and Nix is immediately drawn to his mysteriousness. I would be, too. I loved Blake and his mysterious character, but honestly? My heart is for the gorgeous Kashmir. Kashmir is Nixs best friend, and they have known each other for a long time. He is also a thief, and helps Nixs father to all of the deeds that Nix herself would never want to do. AGH. My heart flutters like hell when hes in a chapter. I need them to be together. Shes kind of torn between the two, and I wonder how the next book will patch things up. AND GUYS. THE ENDING? Nix is well... SPOILER stuck with them both. Hah. SPOILER ENDS So what I had a slight issue with was the ending itself. That was just chaotic and I found that it happened so fast that I didnt know what exactly happened. I still dont even know. I dont know how Nixs father made the decision that he did, and I had to go over the last chapter or so a few times, but it still was foggy. I need a greater explanation, PLEASE. But thats cool, fine. I LOVE THIS BOOK, OH EM GEE. The Girl From Everywhere is one of the most stunning debuts I have ever read. WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ROMANCE who cares about the love triangle? It works!, a heroine who is one of a kind, and a plot slash story that I cannot get out of my head. This book seems like a dream, I cant believe I was so fortunate to read it, because its unlike anything that my brain would ever come up with in a million years. Who knows? Maybe I could Navigate into 2017 and grab a copy from the amazing Heidi herself. THAT WOULD BE THE BEST.
Painful. Intense. Emotional. This book made me hurt. It made me hurt and hurt and then the author went deeper and ripped out my heart even more. If you have read the first two books in this series dont worry, this can be read as a stand alone you know of Joan and Max. And then you hear these two are somehow going to fall in love in this book, and you think, huh? How in the world is that going to happen? At the end of The Truth About Him, Joan drags a very injured Max into her car and races away. Their journey has just begun. Joan has been trying to find a way to save her sister for years. Joan and her sister Jennifer fell on very hard times and accidentally ended up in a cult  the kind where the leader is a lunatic and has a dozen wives. This lunatic also is a big drug dealer  and Max has been moving his product for him. Joan escapes one night, but Lagan, the lunatic leader, is able to keep Jennifer, and basically threatens her life if Joan is ever seen again. Joan is swamped with guilt, and tracks Lagans drug dealings to a strip club where Maxs motorcycle gang has set up shop. After a series of events where Maxs club turns on him, Lagan flees, Max is shot and beat up, and Joan, knowing that Max is her only connection to Lagan, drags him into her car, and she heads south to Florida where her aunt lives. A former combat nurse, her aunt can patch up Max....and Joan can force him to tell her how to contact Lagan, and eventually save her sister. But Max is stubborn. Max has lived a very hard life  and done some very bad things. He wants out of the club life but reason after reason he finds himself back with Lagan and his crooked motorcycle club. He has lived for months waiting for a bullet in the head, so when it comes, he isnt shocked. What surprises him is to wake up handcuffed to a bed in a condo in Florida. And for Joan to be his caretaker. Max is pissed. He wants out of the handcuffs and he wants revenge on his club and all those that turned on him. But Joan needs him to help save her sister. There are many, many other factors that come into play but its too much to get into. They both have very messy pasts that the author very patiently introduces to the reader. They both have very complicated relationships with their family  Max and his brother Dylan, and Joan and her aunt Fern. Its intriguing, and painful and I love that the author gives you all of this back story which richly enhances this story. This book almost entirely takes place in a condo in Florida  and yet I could not stop turning the pages. For a long time, Max is handcuffed to a bed  and I could not stop turning the pages. The author gives you such raw and emotional conversation, its completely captivating. Max had seen Joan months before all of this went down, when she was a stripper at his club. He had an instant reaction to her, so she isnt a stranger when he finds himself locked up in a bedroom with her. You. That night at the club. Watching me. Remember? He sucked in a breath. My skin was so hot under his gaze, I could barely stand it. Oh, I fucking remember. He jerked his head back, his cheeks flushed, and fuck if I wasnt into it again. This guy, this fucking guy. It was a chemistry thing between us, something animal and base. Unreasonable. That night, I left the stage and I thought youd come find me. I was waiting for you to come find me. But you didnt. He shook his head. All tight and restrained. Controlled. Oh God, I loved that. I wanted to pull at those restraints. I wanted to unravel them, one by one, and see what would happen. These two are both so broken and damaged, the tension between them became so thick. Max and Joan have both made bad choices in life. They both feel like they dont deserve any happiness in their lives. Max will do anything to get out of the handcuffs and get revenge on his socalled friends in his club. Joan will do anything to keep Max chained up until he agrees to help save her sister. Because they are both so brutally intent on their course of action, they hate each other. Neither is willing to give up anything, and so they come to a standstill. And simmering beneath this hatred and this pain, is explosive chemistry. Suck my dick and Ill call him. Youre lying. I was. I was lying. Fine, suck my dick because you want to. Suck my dick and Ill make you come so hard you black out and for a minute, one goddamn minute, well pretend we dont live like this. Well pretend that were normal. That were decent fucking humans and not the pieces of shit we are. The torment made me ache. They both try so hard to be in control of each other, and because their future is unraveling and they have nothing to hold on to they are desperate for this control. So they pick and torment and rage at each other. But then things start to change. They open up about their past. They start telling small truths to one another. They take a moment and see just a teeny tiny glimmer of what their lives could be together in the future. But there is so much weighing them down in the present, its almost impossible to keep that glimmer of hope alive. Their fear of actually admitting their feelings and realizing they care about someone, and the fear of losing that someone, is intense. He pulled me right up against him, so his breath was on my mouth. A kiss I couldnt have. But I want you to tell me it hurts, he said. Stop playing this hard as ice game of yours and tell me that it hurts to push me away. Tell me that this thing between us matters to you. We stood there looking at each other and I couldnt hide my shock. I was slack jawed and limp in his grip. Of course it fucking hurt. It felt like ripping off my skin to watch him leave. Id never had anyone like him in my life. Not ever. And maybe I never would again. And the grief of that would put me on my knees if I said the words. But somehow they do  and eventually Max gets unchained, and things happen and more things happen and my heart broke and then it smiled so hard. Molly OKeefe writes the hell out of this book. She takes two flawed and broken people and just lays it out. No barriers, no skirting around issues. She just lays them in front of us in all of their pain and makes us take it . And I loved every single word of it. Easily the best book Ive read this year. Grade: A P.S  As I mentioned, this book can be read as a stand alone, but I also highly recommend the first two books in this series. Everything I Left Unsaid and the sequel, The Truth About Him. The HEA for the Dylan Maxs brother and Annie comes in the second book.
Original post at One More Page One day early this year way before I met the Goodreads people I was going around Fully Booked in Eastwood when I suddenly had this little fantasy. I wondered: what if, as I was looking for books to get, I meet a guy who has the same taste in books as I do? A straight, single guy, near my age, who reads for fun? And lets make him cute, too. It was a little fantasy that my friends and I entertained often, and it almost became a topic of a story for my fiction blog one day I will write that. It was definitely something my single bookish friends and I thought would be very nice but may be rare, as we know few guys who are willing to read the same books we do, and most of the people we see in the bookstore near our office is filled with girls that is, until I met the Goodreads people, again. So its no wonder why Dash and Lilys Book of Dares by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan would call to me. Okay, I didnt really pay attention to it first because I wasnt really a fan of Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist by the same authors, until I read a review. I checked the sample and fell in love with it on the first few pages, particularly on the opening scene. Dash finds a red notebook amidst the books in the Strand, and inside were a bunch of clues left by a girl named Lily. He figures out the clues and thus starts the passing of the red Moleskine notebook back and forth between the two. Dash and Lily accomplish dares all around New York City from each other and bare their innermost thoughts to the other through the red notebook, all the while wondering if the words represent the persons behind them. The story happens during the holidays, so I figured Christmas should be the right time to read it thanks again to Ace for giving me a copy during the Goodreads Christmas party. And I was right. I am so glad I read it at this time of the year. : Like I said, I wasnt very enamored by Nick and Norah, but Dash and Lily really made me fall in love. Theres so many things to love. Maybe it was the bookstore? Maybe its the Moleskine notebook which I love, by the way? Maybe its how the story unfolded despite it being slightly hard to believe? Dash and Lily are two very interesting characters. Theyre not the angsty teenagers that we read in contemporary YA but theyre very smart and witty teens who are very different yet they speak to each other in ways only they can understand. While I didnt find Dash particularly dashing, I thought he was very welladjusted for his age. Perhaps it was all the reading that he does that makes him a gentler version of the male gender? I dont know, but Id like to think so. Lily, on the other hand, is probably the most optimistic female character Ive ever read so far. She reminds me of myself in so many ways: she bakes, she likes animals, her positive outlook, and in how shes never had a boyfriend. Lily is such a delight to read because I feel like Im reading some things I write, almost like I was reading my journal. And just as the characters, the story was very charming. It tried to tackle more than the usual boymeetsgirlandtheyfallinlove story and thats good, but sometimes the connections and issues feel a bit too messy and hard to follow. The entire interaction may seem a bit farfetched too, and I dont think this will be very effective here in Manila, but I can forgive that for the sake of fiction and thats why it happened in New York and not here, LOL. Despite that, though, I thought the plot was wellexecuted, and I found myself hanging on to every word all the way up to the end. My copy of Dash and Lilys Book of Dares has so many dogears too because of the quotable quotes! For example: Prayer or not, I want to believe that, despite all evidence to the contrary, it is possible for anyone to find that special person. That person to spend Christmas with or grow old with or just take a nice silly walk in Central Park with. Lily, p. 75 I wish I could remember the moment when I was a kid and I discovered that the letters linked into words, and that the words linked to real things. What a revelation that must have been. We dont have the words for it, since we hadnt yet learned the words. It must have been astonishing, to be given the key to the kingdom and see it turn in our hands so easily. Dash, p. 87 You think fairy tales are only for girls? Heres a hint  ask yourself who wrote them. I assure you, it wasnt just the women. Its the great male fantasy  all it takes is one dance to know that shes the one. All it takes is the sound of her song from the tower, or a look at her sleeping face. And right away you know  this is the girl in your head, sleeping or dancing or singing in front of you. Yes, girls want their princes, but boys want their princesses just as much. And they dont want a very long courtship. They want to know immediately. p. 131 And my favorite and is very applicable for the coming year: There are just lots of possibilities in the world...I need to keep my mind open for what could happen and not decide that the world is hopeless if what I want to happen doesnt happen. Because something else great might happen in between. p. 227 The blurb was right. Dash and Lilys Book of Dares is a feel good book that would make you want to start ...perusing bookstore shelves, looking and longing for a love and a red notebook of their own. It doesnt have to be Christmas when you read it, but the holidays add to the ambiance. Its the kind of book that will surely leave you smiling long after you have read the last word. : Im not about to start looking for a red notebook in Fully Booked...but as for leaving one? Ill never tell. ;
I hope you never allow yourself to believe I went through with it because you failed me in some way. All those nights you held me and just let me cry...you have no idea how many times youve already saved me.  Losing Hope So if yall didnt know Hopeless was my favorite read in 2012 and my second favorite read of all time  which is amazing because I have read a lot...So when I found out that Holder gets his voice and Colleen was giving us his voice I was ecstatic. I was so very eager to get my hands on Losing Hope because I wanted to know every little thought, every little whisper, every little emotion that Holder felt in Hopeless and Colleen Hoover did not disappoint. I was in a constant state of emotion while reading this, I felt like I was right there in the story I connected to Holder and SkyHope so much and I felt everything. I felt every smile, every laugh, every tear, every fear, everything and when an author can make a reader feel everything you know that, that author is an amazing storyteller and Colleen Hoover has proved to me again that she will give us more wonderful stories in the future. When reading Hopeless did you ever wonder what Holder was thinking after Les died? When you were reading Hopeless did you ever wonder if their lives ever crossed paths after Hope was taken? Did you ever wonder exactly what Holder blamed himself for? Well in Losing Hope we get it all, we get Holders story. It is beautiful, heartwarming, devastating, and filled with so much love and hope and I am so glad we get to hear his voice. So this is my review for Losing Hope but I urge you if you havent read Hopeless yet please do not read this review and go get Hopeless, read it and fall in love with it than come back and read this. The boy who lost Hope Losing Hope I cant say enough about how perfect this book was  it just was! You learn so many new things that you didnt read in Hopeless and I have to say some of it shocked the hell out of me. Its the same story but so much more because you get to see everything that was happening to Holder and let me tell you THERE. WAS. A LOT. We all know what happened to Les but we learn so much more about Les and how Holder dealt with losing her. He opens his soul in this story and I wanted to grab it and handle it with care because I could tell how badly he was hurting just from his words and it broke my heart. I experienced the ugly cry again in Losing Hope and I cant get over this story. I went into this story thinking that we would get Hopeless from Holders POV but boy was I wrong  I learned so much more about him. His past, present, and future apart from HopeSky, we learned about him apart from Hopeless, this is really HIS story not his POV from Hopeless! Every single time I close my eyes I see Less eyes. Every time my mother looks at me, shes watching me tell her that her daughter is dead for the second time. For the third time. For the thousandth time. Every time I take a breath or blink or speak, I experience her death all over again. I dont sit here and wonder if the fact that shes dead will ever sink in. I sit here and wonder when Ill stop having to watch her die.Losing Hope Your heart will break for Holder learning all the things that he went through and all the guilt he held in himself for the things that happened to Les and Hope. It made me sad for him because none of it was his fault. I watched as he crumbled and lost all hope and all I wanted to do was comfort him and tell him everything was going to be okay. The journey that Holder goes on in Losing Hope is a beautiful and sometimes scary journey. Knowing what happens I found myself anticipating the next scene, the next chapter wanting to know exactly how he reacted over a certain situation or a certain conversation. What I didnt expect that I was so glad Colleen gave us was she gave us so much more of Holders reactions and so much more of his thoughts and it truly just made it that much more beautiful. I dont think she could have done it any better. Holder is still Holder and oh so much more. He is sexy, passionate, caring, loving, sometimes a bit confusing, but god he has a way with words. Let me inform you of something, I say, lowering my voice. The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if youve never felt anything when someones kissed you, then no ones ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you. Squuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuueeeeeee he makes my heart melt and I know he will make yours melt. He is just so Holder and just so Dean and just so everything that is beautiful in this world. I want my very own Holder to come home to every night because good grief the love that boy has inside him that he has to give is an all consuming love and that is the type of love I want. I found myself smiling a lot while reading Losing Hope because I was remembering so many wonderful moment from Hopeless that I got to relive again since I didnt write a review for Hopeless because it was before I started writing reviews which I am kind of sad about that I dont have a review for Hopeless because it defiantly deserves an amazing review. I smiled and remember the moment that Holder spoke these words to Sky and it quickly brought butterflies back to my belly. I live you, Sky, I say against her lips. I live you so much. Now you too can smile and gush over all things that are Dean Holder. I even fell in love with Daniel in Losing Hope and Breckin too. You know Daniel is Holders closest friend and Breckin Skys second very best friend in the entire world. Daniel and Breckin brought a bunch of humor to this story and I found myself cracking up at some of the things that would come out of Daniels mouth! Why are you being such a cunt nugget? I thought Mormons werent allowed to have caffeine, I say to him. Breckin shrugs. I decided to break that rule the morning I woke up gay. I could continue to go on and on and on about Losing Hope because the pages within the bounds of this book hold so much and will pull out so many different emotions from you. But the point of this long review is that Colleen Hoover is brilliant. She gave us Hopeless and then gave us more of Holder in Losing Hope and all I can say is buy it, read it, and fall even more in love with Holder because I promise you Holder will forever hold a piece of your heart. He stole a bigger piece of my heart in this story and I can tell you, he will do the same to you! For the next few minutes, were completely lost in what feels like sheer perfection. Time has completely stopped, and all Im thinking about while we kiss is how this is what saves people. Moments like these with people like her are what make all the suffering worth it. Its moments like these that keep people looking forward and I cant believe Ive let them slip by for an entire month.  Losing Hope Hopeless and Losing Hope will stay with me forever.

Entering Monsterland apprehensive to a point Wyatt, Sean and his two friends begin to contemplate their decision as to why they came and what if anything is the real motive behind the theme park? Wyatt and his friends would learn several lessons as they enter the park and go on the first ride which scared Jade and the rest of the group but first the watched a video that should have alerted them to the real reason behind what Vincent was doing as the werewolves were planning an escape and the video showed the animals being tortured leaving them wondering what was really happening and were the dead ones being fed to the zombies? Blood everywhere and the vampires were putting on a show and the main attraction would be Howard and Keisha. The werewolves had their own agenda and the President and the dignitaries felt they were in unison and that people from different countries could work together to create something that would attract many people and protect the species that needed to be placed in an enclosed setting to save the world. Vincent Noland is crazy as we get to hear his voice when directing his guards, the vampires and promising Raoul that Keisha would be his but patience first. Howard got locked into the clutches too and the final outcome of this opening will shock readers. When Wyatt finally sees Jade he realizes the fear in her eyes being near Nolan who terrorized her to date him? But, things are about to get more than out of control when the real show starts and the bodies begin falling in many directions. The spectators seem entranced with the show and the vampires, werewolves and the zombies provide the entertainment until they dont. Billy is one of the werewolves and he has a plan to escape and want Sylvia and the others to follow suit but will they? Konrad made as the author relates a mockery out of science and of course he had no cure or any intention of finding a cure for the virus or studying the inhabitants held captive here. He was evil, cold just looking at this eyes its surprising that no one realized but what money talks, the inmates will try and rebel but things take a tragic and deadly turn. Copper Valley will never be the same since chosen for the site of the Park in the United States. Terror reigns, carnage soars and the theme park definitely not like anything anyone has ever seen before will haunt the visitors nightmares forever. But, first join them on the River Run with the Werewolves, enter Vampire Village at your own risk hoping they are not thirsty for your blood and finally meet the zombies in Zombiewille. A theme parks worse than any science fiction graphic movie and the truth behind it the vision of a sick mans thirst for power and control over the world. Carter did not realize at first what his fate might be as walking around with Vincent, guarding the visitors and trying to protect the President who never saw what was about to happen coming and the entire group would be blindsided and the rest you might say is all politics. Explaining that the Vampires have lived among us on the fringe of society and trying to justify why he felt he was doing great work to protect them, you could feel Carter and Jessup the other guard reeling. Carter regretted not sending his sons home but the worst has yet to come as things escalate and the violence begins and you see the show with Howard Drucker and Keisha as the main events. The blood from her neck and her pale face just appearing to be deathlike lets readers know Raouls goal and what will happen if she does not get away from this vampire very soon. He wants he to become one of them but will she give in? The battle begins but who will win the vampires, werewolves, the zombies or the humans? What about the dignitaries what is their fate? What the author reveals through Vincent is frightening as many terrorist groups try to take over many different countries and kill off anyone standing in their way. What makes you think that Konrads plan is any different? The harsh reality about what he wants to do and the end result for the President, the dignitaries and some of the visitors will horrify readers and let you know never to get sucked in by someone claiming to change the world and create a cure for something incurable. Hear the screams, the struggles and learn what happens when humans fight back, when a terrorist is exposed and his plot to revealed? Who wins? Who lives? Who might become one of his inmates? What harsh reveal about Wyatts past is revealed and who will find their way out of Monsterland and who will remain captive forever? Wyatt is a strong character and learns something about his stepfather which might cause him to embrace and trust this man more than his own father. Truths, lies, betrayals, hate, power, control as author Michael Okon takes us deep inside the mind of a sadistic man claiming to want to make the world saver for humans one death at a time but whose? Do you want an invitation to the opening of Monsterland? After reading this whats your answer? Fran Lewis: Just reviewsMJ magazine
Beautiful. Just beautiful. Merged review: FINAL RATING: 5.00 STARS CATCHALL Only the second 5.00 star book Ive read this year, but utterly and completely deserving. I can honestly say that I have no real complaints. Everything was beautiful, from start to finish, and I was unable to put it down even once. The cover is absolutely marvelous and made me fall in stand love, and I was not disappointed. THE HEROINE THERESA GRAY Tessa grows and changes much in this book as compared to Clockwork Angel. She expands and becomes, in my opinion, much more likable. She is heartbreakingly real and absolutely wonderful. Shes courageous, beautiful, and undeniably relatable. She has an aura of power but also of innocence. Tessa is strong but acts very human. She is a wonderfully written heroine and I cannot wait to read more about her. THE LOVE INTERESTS JAMES CARSTAIRS I am absolutely Team Jem, a fact I have never tried to hide. Theres something about him thats heartbreaking and beautiful and very, very attractive. I was immediately drawn to him in Angel and have been continued to be drawn to him in Prince. I love reading about him almost more than anything. I actually read pages 201205 probably like 941,526,234,146,134,455,245,274,982 times. I think the scene is that beautiful. I enjoy nothing more than daydreaming about him. Hes kind, and eventempered, but somehow still not boring. I think hes amazing, and definitely one of my alltime favorite characters. Hes like my ideal of a perfect man. He actually reminds me of my boyfriend rather a lot. They both act similar and theyre bothwell, I may as well say itdying. Still, I hope something can be done so that hell live. Both of them. But I digressthis is getting rather personal. WILLIAM HERONDALE Im going to be brutally honest here: I did not like Will at all in Angel. But in this book, he grew on me immensely. I found myself actually attracted to him and by the end of the book, I had fallen in love with him. It would have been difficult not tohes so beautiful and determined. As I learned more about him, the less I began to dislike him. He grows stronger and much nicer in this installment until I had a hard time remembering why I disliked him so much in the first place. Will took his place as one of my favorite book characters easily. THE OTHER SECONDARY CHARACTERS CHARLOTTE AND HENRY BRANWELL Charlotte and Henry are developed beautifully in this book. Their relationship grows as well, and a certain scene that took place between the two of them actually moved me to tears, it was so sweet. I adored them and I certainly want to hear more about them. They each grow individually as well, becoming stronger. GIDEON LIGHTWOOD He surprised me. I expected a much different kind of character than I was presented with, and I believe Im a little in love with him too. He was unexpectedly beautiful. I hope to see much more of him in the upcoming Princess. He seems quite kind and sympathetic, as well as allaround good. BENEDICT AND GABRIEL LIGHTWOOD Father and son, each is a very intriguing and deep character. We dont get to see a whole lot of them, which is a shame, but perhaps well see more of them later on. They played significant roles that I would love to see expanded. JESSAMINE LOVELACE First, I feel compelled to point out that this is what jessamine looks like: That aside, she had an interesting plot twist as well. She intrigued me from the very beginning of the book but I never saw anything coming until it was revealed. It was an unpleasant but welldone surprise that was significant and not at all dull. NATHANIEL GRAY I love how Clare deals with family drama and hatred. In TMI it was Clary and Valentine; in TID its Tessa and Nate. I have my own family issues so its interesting for me to read about these things. But again, I digress. Nate is a very well developed character. He plays no small role, which didnt completely shock me but there were some aspects I did not see coming. We see more of his real character in this book, as opposed to the mask we were given in Angel. MAGNUS BANE I love. But then again, who doesnt? We only get little teasing glimpses of him in this book, but each is exquisite and I adored each one. I hope we have more of him in Princess. SOPHIE Not just a maid anymore, Sophie contributes to the plot of Prince significantly. Also, I liked her much better in this book than in the last. THE PLOT The plot must have had 473 twists, which kept me constantly guessing. It was quickly paced but not so fast that I couldnt breathe. I constantly felt like I had to absolute know what came next, leaving me unable to put the book down, even for a single aching moment. It is beautifully original and historically correct as well. Enough questions and conflicts are resolved that I didnt get totally frustrated, but I was still left absolutely aching for the next book. The plot was wonderful and made this book completely unputdownable! Clare has created such a marvelous world and seamlessly incorporated it into what was real. Instead of feeling false, it feels undeniably and absolutely real. THE ROMANCE JEM AND TESSA Jem and Tessas romance develops far more in this book than it did in the last. It is subtle and sweet, but is most assuredly there. There is undeniably chemistry between them that heats up very quickly in this book. Its most certainly not cliched or overdramatized, but feels realistic. It sizzles but is not overdone. It feels like a real, genuine love that grows and changes throughout. It is slow, but steady, the kind of feeling that lasts. WILL AND TESSA I love both Will and Tessa, but I will never love their romance. It reminds me too much of Jace and Clary. Dont get me wrongI love Jace and Clarys romancebut I dont want to read about the same couples again. And again and again and again. But its also lessI feel chemistry, but not love. More like heavy, heavy lust, which, lets face it, is wonderful, but fades. THE WRITING I will probably continue to be blown away by Clares writing until I die. It is absolutely beautiful. It is descriptive, it is pretty, it is lovely. It describes everything in immaculate detail and doesnt leave the feeling of holes or confusion. The book is mostly told from Tessas point of view, and Clare gives her an achingly read and beautiful voice, which was impossible for me not to admire. There was no way that with such beautiful writing I could not have loved this. It is incredibly wellwritten. THE ENDING Hello, surprise. While it wasnt completely unexpected, it wasnt the number one outcome I had predicted in my head. It was fantastic and desperate and beautiful. I really, really liked it. But as I do not want to give anything away I will say no more! WRAPUP Oh, yes, I will be reading Clockwork Princess. As soon as I possibly can, and desperately. I need to get my hands on it. FINE. You can also read this review on Sparkles and Lightning.  Team Jem all the way!! Jem is love 33
Oh, goodness. I am not normally a huge book reader, meaning that I dont often read really big books. Its not that Im against bog books, but I find I end up putting them off and putting them off in favor of smaller books. And then all too often, when I finally get to the big book, I find that it didnt need about 200 pages. Pages that were filled with unnecessary description or useless dialogue. And I find that I would have liked the book much better had it been 200 pages shorter. That was definitely not the case with Winter. Even though it was 820 pages, I loved every moment of it. Now, that may have partly been due to the way I buddy read it. The book is broken up into 5 smaller books and so my friend and I read about one of the smaller books a week. It worked out perfectly and gave the big book an episodic feel that was perfect. But, mainly, the reason I loved every page was due to the fact that Marissa Meyer is just such an amazing writer! She has a perfect blend of adventure and drama and romance, so youre always entertained. Just when one person gets rescued or one couple makes a breakthrough, another person finds themselves in mortal peril or another couple has a misunderstanding. Its perfect! I spent the whole series going, Aw! Oh no! Yay! Holy Cow! Oh no! Aw! Awesome! Watch Out! Oh no!. And there was never a point where I was like, Yeah, yeah, get on with it already. Cinder and Kai: Cinder is probably my favorite of the main heroines. Ive always been a fan of the scrappy youth that grows up with nothing and then learns they are supposed to be great story arc. Because theyve grown up being mistreated and having nothing, they know how important it is to share and treat others well. And those are the exact qualities Cinder has. Throughout the books, she strives to do her best by the people shes trying to help. And she struggles with her fears of inadequacy and inabilities, so she tries harder to be helpful and do the right thing. And I love that about her. Kai, however, was one of my least favorite Heroes. But thats not a character flaw. Its just that, with his position, he had to be proper and the emperor and couldnt be the reckless renegade that crashed the party. I think he did a wonderful job with what he had and his diplomacy often saved the others when nothing else would have. I also appreciated his inner struggles about Cinder in the book Scarlet. He didnt just follow his heart, he first thought through how any actions in regard to Cinder were going affect his kingdom. And he very often made sacrifices of himself for his people, as a leader should. Scarlet and Wolf: I loved the relationship between Scarlet and Wolf. I loved that, once they discovered each other, that was it. Theyd mated for life and nothing was going to change that. However, I think Scarlet was one of my least favorite heroines, though she did redeem herself in this last book. Im not all that big a fan of the hot blooded redhead thing. As I said, though, I liked her much more in Winter and I think thats because of the interactions between her and Winter. They balanced each other out in a really good way. Wolf. My heart broke so many times for Wolf. The amount of heartache that poor boy had to go through is too much for any one person to experience. And I loved that, through it all, he strove to do the right thing. Wolf will always have a special spot in my heart. My one real regret about the end of this story is how Wolf couldnt be put back after they saved the world. I wish they could have undone the last changes they had made to his body so that he could go back to how he was when he first met Scarlet Cress and Thorne: It was so nice to see how Cress grew through the series. When we first meet her in Cress, shes such a child and one given to delusions of grandeur. Of pirates and heroes and princesses and kisses. She sees everything in ideals and has to learn that not everything is how it is in storybooks and her imagination. I also loved that, even though she was scared so much of the time, she still strove to help wherever she could. And her hacking skills are amazing! Thorne was hands down my favorite hero. I loved his swagger and quips and really enjoyed watching him grow from the uber superficial thief, to the hero Cress always thought he was. Winter and Jacin: I loved the heart of Winter. I loved how she had made a decision not to use her gift because of how it could hurt people and then she stuck to her guns and didnt use it. However, I found that her crazy episodes got to be bothersome after a while. Especially when she and Scarlet were supposed to be escaping the castle. I often found that she was a burden, but then it paid off when they had to recruit later on, didnt it? Jacin irritated me a lot too. Hes not much a a team player, is he? I mean, I get that his first priority was Winter and keeping her safe, but sometimes he followed that objective to the detriment of everyone else and I wasnt all that keen on that. His and Winters romance wasnt all that great, either. I mean, I loved that they loved each other, but I was much more a fan of the other three couples, honestly. Levana: What can I say about Levana? She was totally insane and evil and played that part perfectly. Whenever she could do the worst thing imaginable, she usually did, and often with the help of Aimery, who was scary evil. In fairest, we learned some of the reason why Levana is the way she is, but it obviously doesnt excuse the way she is. She had plenty of opportunity to be a better person, but never once took it. Iko and Torin: These two arent a couple, obviously, but they both are minor players that had a big impact on the major players. Iko is probably my favorite character in the whole series. I loved her pluck and sarcasm and enthusiasm. I cheered when Thorne found her a body. I loved how much she cared for Cinder. I just loved her. She was awesome. I really liked Torin a lot too. During Cinder, I was worried that wed find out he was a double agent working for Levana, but Im so glad that he wasnt. He always took great care of Kai and thats to be commended. If they ever make a movie out of this series I think Torin should be played by Hector Elizondo. The Lunar Chronicles is one of my favorite series of all time. I truly loved reading it and can see myself rereading these books in years to come. I will be reading the last story in Stars Above today and then will say goodbye to this great world. I cannot wait until Meyers next book come out!
Shahrzad is a difficult girl, and I am a monster. I suppose that makes for a good match. I often know that I am, at one point or another, going to read a certain book. Sometimes it may take months and even years, but in the end, I still get around to doing it. Such is the case with The Wrath and the Dawn. It has been on my shelf since forever and I have always known that I would love it. If I actually sat down and read it. Same was the case with Six of Crows and An Ember in the Ashes. And, in all honesty, I was right. I absolutely loved all of these books. My main problem with actually dedicating time to The Wrath and the Dawn was that I just didnt want to approach it at the wrong moment. I know I have said this before, but timing is really important, especially when you have some information about a certain read and you, kind of, know what to expect. So, I am glad I was postponing reading this book until now. In a sense, had I forced myself to read it before, maybe I would not have enjoyed it as much as I did now. The story is, as I am sure everyone knows, based on Arabian Nights, which is a particular favourite of mine. It begins with an enraged and determined Shahrzad, who has volunteered to become the next bride of a Caliph, who is famous for killing his wives on the morning. Her motivation comes from the fact that he has just killed her best friend and this has left Shazi in a position, where she has to seek revenge. An aspect, which was definitely missing, and which has a predominant importance in the original, were the stories. There were two stories told in this book and on one hand, thats a good thing. It means we are shifting away from the original and exploring new horizons. On the other hand, I felt a bit cheater, since I was expecting entertaining stories, which in turn would make Khalid the Caliph interested in Shahrzad. Which brings me to the other aspect, which bugged me continuously. The relationship between Shazi and Khalid was suffering, in my humble opinion, from the instalove curse. Honestly, I did not see how the deep hatred and prejudice she had for him turned into love. I get it that sometimes people are unexplainably drawn to each other, theres lust, which more often than not, does not entail love. However, here everything happened so quickly that I just wasnt convinced. Khalids disinterest disappeared after one day and Shazis hatred dissolved after a few weeks. And on top of it all, their interactions were not that frequent...I mean, she narrated a total of one story, which pretty much sums up their time alone before they fell in love. At around 30 in, they had already fallen for each other. Now, for me, this was a problem and an illogical handling of the situation  the situation where it was obvious they were meant to love each other, otherwise there would have been no story. There is a prominent lack of an antagonist in the story up until the very end. We are pretty sure we are dealing with a curse, which is the reason for the killings, however that is not a strong antagonist. If it is one at all. At the beginning we are told Khalid is the monster, the killer, however I think after he and Shahrzad fell in love, it is not credible to think him as the bad guy. Still, these were pretty much my only problems with this story. If we ignore the quick development of the protagonists relationship, I can wholeheartedly say this was an amazing story. It is quite heavy on the romance part, however, I think everyone whos started it, should have already known that. For me, this was a plus since I was in the mood for a romantic fantasy. The characters were definitely one of the strongest elements of this story. They were all extremely well fleshed out and their portrayals were individual in the sense that they immediately got assigned a certain personality, that you could track until the end. On the other hand, this made them a little predictable. However, it is immensely more difficult to make predictable characters interesting. And these characters were interesting. They made me sympathize with them, they made me care for them even though I knew how they were going to react most of the times. For this, I really applaud the author. Another great aspect of the book was the writing, which was effortlessly beautiful without being overburdened. Renee Ahdieh really has a gift. There were so many moments when I just read and reread certain passages for the sheer beauty of the language. And again, all was effortlessly done in a way that was not imposing. There are a lot of authors there is one in particular I am thinking of at the moment, who make it their goal to write in a ridiculously descriptive way, using a ton of metaphors and epithets, hoping this would deceive the reader they are gifted writers. Some authors, dont really need that. I am placing Renee Ahdieh next to Laini Taylor in my imaginary ranking of writers, who have the best use of language. Even though there were a lot of things I didnt like, I realized I didnt like them only when I sat down and started writing this review. For when I was actually reading, I raced through the whole book, it gripped me and didnt let go. Thats how addicting it was. So really, all the negative aspects I listed came to me in retrospect, which probably means they are not much for a problem for the overall read. All in all, I can say, this was an incredibly enjoyable read and I absolutely am going to read the second, and final, part. Endnote: As always, positive reviews are so much harder to write than the negative ones...
This book was kind of an oxymoron for me for though I had issues with the writing that would have made me rate it poorly, the concept, plot, and world were so interesting to me that I could actually get past the issues for the most part and get really into the book. Let me explain... This book started kind of slow for me. At first all I could see were the writing issues. At first the book is repetitive and the author isnt the best at description so it was really hard for me to picture the world. Then it felt like the author had just renamed things as his way to change this world and that really annoyed me. Also, he had said some things and then he must have forgotten he did, and then he ended up going against his words. Like at first you meet Darrow in his frysuit and its to keep them from burning to death but then he loses a glove and gets a burn when he touches his hand on his drill and I dont understand how he didnt burn to death because thats the gist of why they wear frysuits or maybe I understood that totally wrong because of the confusing writing?. Then the author had some issues explaining this new world. At one point he had the character who hears someone mention a Bronze and then he thinks in his head, A Bronze is a faded Gold of the same class, but looked down on for inferior appearance, lineage, and capabilities. Im sorry, but that had no point other than for the readers benefit and its not something he would have been thinking in that exact wording which, since the point of view is first person present, the things he thinks are exactly what hes thinking word for word. Another example of this was at one point he thinks House Minerva. Greeks would have called it Athena. Again, he thinks it only so the reader gets it. He could have thought something better that would have explained it without being literally only for the reader. Theres no reason Darrow would think that exact sentence. When he tried to have a different character explain the world, it felt like reciting a history book rather than a person speaking to another person. Very boring and clinical and not how the characters talk to each other either. As for the pace of the book, it was really hard to empathize and connect with Darrow because everything characterwise is glossed over too quickly without being vivid. It just moves way too fast. Especially his pain and suffering to become a Gold. That literally is basically, It hurts rather than describing it to the point where I feel the pain myself. And at one point he dislocates his shoulder and yet, even in first person present, you dont learn about it for pages until it has a point in the story. Its like it was written in as an afterthought. Another weird thing was that theres this part where he has proctors talking and making jokes and its literally two pages of them just joking and theres nothing else happening. No explanations for what Darrow is thinking or doing. As if it was a stage show and all the lights were turned off so you could only see what the spotlight was on rather than all the things going on around that. So that totally bugged me. Its so internal that all external details are forgotten, which made it really hard to see this world. Also, sometimes I just didnt follow what the author was trying to say. Out of nowhere would be a comment that pulled me out of the book and even going back and reading it a few times, I still have no idea what hes trying to say. At one point hes talking about all the great classic books from Earth, but they only name real books. This is supposed to be who knows how far into the future, so it would have been interesting to put some fake books in there with titles that could have shown the way the society was changing to go from what we are now to what they are then. Also, then Darrow mentions thing he cant know. Like at one point that another Gold at school is wearing paint on her face made out of berry juice and animal fat. How could he know that? He couldnt. One more example is when he sees his proctor and he thinks, His eyes are ringed and tired despite the collagen...to cover the fatigue. How would he know the proctor was using collagen? It also mentions makeup, and I can see how he would see that, but collagen? One last thing. There are a lot more issues, but Im going to go into the one other that kept pulling me out of the book and that was how he capitalized a lot of words that shouldnt be capitalized. Like Jackal, when he used it as a name, okay, but at one point he used it as the name of an animal and still capitalized it. Same with the words senator, governor, drafter, blood war, proctors, oath breaker, and then the colors. All of these things should only capitalized when used as a proper name. If its President so and so, yes, if its president of the school, no. So that kept pulling me out. I dont know how the editors didnt notice that and fix it. If I had judged the book all the above alone, I would have hated it. However, once the book got going, I fell so in love with the world, plot, and concept Im talking the society since I couldnt picture the world very well with the lack of details that I got totally hooked. I dont feel like it was done justice because, like I said, it moved too quickly and so it was hard to feel an emotional response, but man, did I keep thinking how badly I wanted to see this as a movie so I could actually SEE this world and FEEL this character. Because of how much I LOVE the concept, world, and plot, I will give this book 4 stars and Ive already started reading the second. Update: I read this again 8 months later and was able to ignore the mistakes and fall absolutely into it. But I believe its because I was rereading it after also reading the second book I have to get ready for the third and the second book was written much better for the most part so Im totally connected to Darrow and this world. As a reread, this has become my favorite series and I would give it 5 stars, writing issues be damned.
For full review, visit:  It has been several hours since I have finished reading It Ends With Us, and I am still unable to stop the train of emotions that hit me while reading this book. I am so behind my reviews right now, but I need to write this one right this instant. Not because I want to get everything out while it is still fresh because I am certain I will remember this story and all the feelings it brought out of me for a long time. But because it is not only the best book that Colleen Hoover has written to date, but it is one of the few books that affected me so deeply, that I think deserves to be read by every single person on this planet. The only other contemporary book that has affected me this much is In The Stillness by Andrea Randall. I am not sure if I want to outline all my emotions in full detail, or leave it vague because I went into this book completely unaware of what the story was about, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. So for those who have not read this book just yet, all I can say is just read it. It follows an incredibly mature, strong and wonderful character Lilly who narrates a tremendously deep storyline with many life lessons, love stories, terrible and wonderful actions, lifechanging experiences, friendships, family bonds, and overall, the perfect outline of what is like to be human. It gives muchneeded perspective on life and certain actions us humans often need to take. At least it changed my perception on quite a few sensitive topics. The strength of the book comes from Lillys character, and the wonderful writing technique Colleen Hoover uses in telling her story. A first persons point of view results in the reader sharing the same emotions with the main character. The storys continuation throughout several years, also giving insight into Lillys past through diary entries addressed to Ellen DeGeneres, provides tremendous depth of the story. But mostly, it surprises the reader making them fall in love with all the characters, excusing their wrongful behaviour on several occasions, and seeing the reasoning behind it. Not only it is an incredibly powerful story, it also is a great lesson. I believe every single person can find something relatable in this book. Colleen Hoover really outdid herself with this one. Although I have loved all of this womans work, when I think about some of her books now, I am not sure that the present me would like them as much as the past me. However, I guess with me maturing, I can see Colleen Hoover developing as a writer as well, and giving me exactly what I need with her every piece. So if you have not read this book just yet, I could not recommend it enough as it is truly lifechanging. But be warned of an emotional rollercoaster that is guaranteed to fall upon you. I have read this book during a long coach journey, and I hope not that many people saw me crying for a good couple of hours. So find a comfortable spot, preferably not in public, and read it. Discussion Now for those who have read this book or are not too bothered with some spoilers, I will continue with my ramblings since I do need to get all the emotions that I am feeling out right now. Abuse and the romanticizing it has been a topic that really gets me worked up for quite a while now. I believe far too many books make the abusive alpha males into people who are supposed to be admired and desired. Whereas some texts show only the really horrible parts of the abuse. Coleen Hoover struck the middle of it, exploring the idea of the abuse when it is not just black and white. She completely changed my perception on abuse, towards the abuser, and especially towards the victim. I am one of those people who see the victims of domestic abuse as stupid if they do not have the strength to leave this kind of life instantly after such incident occurs. Experiencing abuse myself on quite a few occasions, it was always hard for me to understand how this kind of behaviour can be excused. I have felt the physical abuse from my mothers boyfriend, and abuse by words from my stepgrandfather, and I could never understand how my mother and grandmother could be so weak and not leave those men. Especially since this abuse was directed towards me. I do not know if it affected my development as a person, but I always want to think that I dealt with it in the best possible way. I never took it, I never stayed silent, I was never afraid, and I always felt in the position of power. I did sometimes feel disappointed in the examples the women in my family were setting though. Now I do understand that it is not that easy. I guess my thick skin and the ability to see reason comes from the lack of emotion towards my abusers. But this book has opened my eyes to the reasons why some women find excuses. Some abusers are not just bad, and with love involved, the good part can easily overshadow the bad. I have seen this example in my stepgrandfather. He is an alcoholic, therefore has two personalities: when he is sober, he is good and caring, and when he is drunk  he is the meanest person on Earth. I always hear my grandmother telling everyone how good he is, but I was never able to excuse his bad parts just because he has good ones. I still do not excuse this behaviour, and never will, but I can see why she chooses to see the good instead of the bad. Regarding this book, it was haunting how relatable I found Lillys relationship with her father and her mother. But what confused me profoundly was the way I felt about Ryles character. I believe that abuse is never excusable, and yet I found myself trying to find reasons behind his behaviour and hoping for a happy ending for him. I loved that character, and although it is impossible to compare real feelings, I do get it now why many women forgive their abusers. I liked the outcome of the book very much, and believe that Colleen Hoover has written the most touching, realistic, and informative story about domestic abuse, and how it is almost never as white and black as you usually wish it was. My perception has changed so profoundly after I finished reading It Ends With Us, my heart was shattered into a million pieces, and yet I think this book should be read by every single woman on Earth because it shows the true colours of life. All humans make mistakes. What determines a persons character arent the mistakes we make. Its how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses. It really was a hunting story, it affected me on such a deep emotional level, and confused me in the way that allowed me to grow up some more. More books lie this should exist. Sorry for my ramblings, but sometimes getting everything out is a necessary step you have to take. I am certain I will remember this book for a long time, therefore my thoughts will always by here to be read whenever I need it.
Daemon Black  PERFECTION Merged review: W.O.W! Seriously. I dont know how to start reviewing this. I just couldnt believe I made myself wait for this long. I am such an I.D.I.O.T. Daemon baby, I wish you could forgive me for being away from you for so long!! ONYX was just... I cant even begin to explain how I felt after I read Onyx. There is just really no words to describe how unbelievably spectacular the experience was. It just have everything in it. It was just so damn PERFECT. I thought Obsidian was already AMAZING but Onyx just went above and beyond AMAZING. It was just PERFECT. Katy was trying hard to stay away from Daemon but Daemon was making it so hard for her to do so. Daemon wanted to prove to Katy that he would do anything for her. Katy was just deadset on her belief that all of the stuff that Daemon has been pulling to get her to fall for him was because of the connection that they with each other he healed her. Out of the blue, a mysterious new guy comes in. Katy thought Blake was the one wholl be able to make her feel normal. But was his intentions clean like what she wants herself to believe? Or does he have secrets of his own that might endanger herself and the people she care about. First off, I would like to say again that this book was IMMACULATE. I couldnt think of any bad thing to say about it unless you count the ending. It was a total cliffhanger! But its not something Im mad about anyway because I dont think I want it to have ended any other way. Okay so Ill have to start first with Katy. I liked her. She was actually one of the best book heroine Ive read so far, that is in Obsidian. But in Onyx, I still like her but majority of the time lets say around 90 i wanted to strangle her kill her because she was getting to annoying. I mean I get her reasons really but what actually pissed me off about her is her lack of trust in Daemon. I mean you wouldnt trust a guy who saved your freakin ass for how many times but you are willing to trust a guy you barely know? For me thats just plain stupid. Im sorry but that was just a big NO for me. There were a lot of times I wanted to pull her hair and btchslap her until she wakes up. Good thing she does wake up and realizes what a moron she has been not only to Daemon but to everyone else around her. Okay so lets talk about my favorite part of the book. Theres DAEMON with all his ILLUSTROUS ALPHA MALENESS. I loved Daemon in Obsidian but in Onyx I became OBSESSED. I would willingly become his slave if he asks me to. Ill be more than happy to make sweet little alien babies with him. It sounds sick but hell yeah I wanna be with Daemon in all ways possible. Daemon has not been the greatest guy in Obsidian. In Onyx, he made me fall headoverheels crazy, madly, in love with him. Youll get to see the side of him you only caught a glimpse of in Obsidian. He will be his usual jerky self but then again youll also see his sweet, protective side that would make you swoon for him over and over again. Youll see that even though Daemon shows everyone what a tough guy he is, he shows his vulnerable side here which made him more endearing to me. Ill have to stop talking about Daemon now because I could go on forever on how freaking amazing he is. Okay so the twists that Onyx had was nothing compared to Obsidian or Shadows. I kind of liked how things built up from where the last book ended to where this book started. Lets talk about the new character Blake who Daemon saw as a competition for Katys affection. But seriously there was NO competition. Come on Daemon? Really? You think Blake was a competition. Not a part of him could compare to you, please remember that? Katy was just being stupid agreeing to be around that guy. I wouldnt want to tell you more about Blake because Ill give too much away. All I could tell you though is that I really want to say to him, I hated the guy. Right from the moment I read about him. Well Ill let you be the judge of that when you read about him. Anyways, this book will really leave you literally BEGGING for more. There is just too much awesomeness in this book. I mean the whole flow of the story made sense to me. I didnt like Katy being stupid but I guess it also worked in a way because it kind of forged a way to make Katy and Daemons relationship even closer. Romance, action and suspense was not the only thing to watch out for in Onyx. There will also be drama. It wont be a real tearjerker but a part of it will really really make you feel sad. Just thinking about it makes me sad again. ONYX one fcking rollercoaster ride! And I think its safe to say NOW that it has become my favorite series of all time! This series is so unbelievable. So for those of you who havent read it yet, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR? This is a seriously awesome book and you are so wasting your time not reading it. To end this outrageously long review, I want to share one of my favorite infuriatingly cute scene in Onyx: You... youre not going to believe me. He pressed another sweet and tender kiss against my lips. But I want to do this right. I started to smile. I doubt you could do this wrong. Daemons lips stretched into a smug half grin. Yeah, Im not talking about that. That I will do perfectly, but I want to... I want us to have what normal couples have. This just took my breath away. It was like I died and went to heaven.  I loved every minute of this!  PRE REVIEW: WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!!! For the love of all the alien babies everywhere!  I am so amazed on how good this book is! The first was already amazing but this was just out of this world!! I could just... Katy was a real disappointment for me here but Daemon was just... J.A.W.D.R.O.P.P.I.N.G! Full review to follow!
Say hello to a new addition to my favorite books ever list and be prepared for a long, gushing rant about why I loved Becky Albertallis brilliant debut Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda so incredibly much. We are introduced to Simon whos a high school junior. He is fairly popular, has a tight group of friends and an awesome, slightly weird, realitytv obsessed family. But theres a part of him that he has not told about to anyone, except to a mysterious boy called Blue that he found from the school Tumblr blog. Simon is gay, and though he knows that theres nothing embarrassing about it, he is not quite sure how to tell the whole world about it. So he starts to email Blue whos in a similar situation and they find a connection that Simon has never felt with anyone before. But then one of Simons drama club buddies finds out about Simons sexuality and takes screen captions of the emails Simon has been exchanging with Blue what a douche, btw! and Simon finds himself from a situation in which he does not quite know what to say or how to act. Simon is pulled into a whirlwind of emotions, revelations and feelings and the eventually it seems like the only constant in his life are the emails from Blue. Simon is such a great protagonist. His life is generally okay and he has a place within his own little community of people, but at the same time, he does not quite feel like the people around him know him fully. He is sure of his sexuality, but at the same time, he is confused about how he should act around others and how things would change if he were to come out to his family and friends. It is so interesting to follow Simon around, to really get into his head and to see the world through his eyes. Simon is funny, extremely relatable and simply a pleasure to read about. Throughout the novel, he feels so real and honest, more like a friend than a fictional character and very quickly he became someone I felt very protective about and someone that I started to deeply care about. The way he can be honest about himself in the emails he exchanges with Blue just made my heart burst from happiness. They are so in sync without even knowing who they are writing to and the way they can trust each other is very admirable. The exchanges between them are like ones found from extremely good 90s romantic comedies, ones that slowly establish the relationship and really savour in the connection between the two people. Because really, the connection between Simon and Blue is MAGICAL. Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda is a love story between two incredible, honest individuals who fall in love under unusual circumstances though I guess Internet love is getting more and more usual these days. The fact that they happen to be gay just makes this book so much more beautiful, in some sense, because of the all the stigma and prejudice that still surrounds these issues. I did not see their romance as more valuable or more special because they are gay  I saw it as valuable and special simply because they are so good to each other and so honest about the ways they feel. Yes, this could have been a novel about a boy and a girl and I probably would have enjoyed it too, but I dont know, just the way these two characters connect in an environment in which they are bullied and looked down to made me so incredibly happy. Albertalli is such a good writer. I mean seriously, this story and the way she has build these characters and their surroundings just took my breath away. I know a lot of people who mainly read fantasydystopian say often that they are not attracted to contemporary YA because the fictional world is always the same, usually high school with a certain group of people are the focus. And yes, you can find that from Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda, but the way that Albertalli writes about these people and this environment is done so well that I never felt like hey, I have read this book before. I loved the pacing of the novel and the switch between the chapters consisting of the email exchanges and the chapters focused on Simons life outside the email exchanges. What was especially interesting was to see how these two worlds, Simons life and the emails with Blue, start to emerge together as they start to know more about each other. One of the best aspects of this book is the mystery of who Blue is. It is made clear in the beginning that Blue is someone who goes to same school with Simon, and it so much fun to put together all the little hints that point towards Blues identity. Yes, I figured it out before it was revealed in novel, but that in no way made this less pleasurable read for me. Actually, I think it just made me love it even more, because I just couldnt wait to reach the point that the two actually meet each other. There is also an interesting array of side characters in this book  Simons family and friends, the drama club people, the people Simon meets as he tries to figure out his sexuality. I loved how the characters all contribute something to the story, but never take the focus away from Blue and Simon. As I was reaching the end of this novel, I felt grief just because I did not want it to end. Simon and Blue are one of those couples that will stay with me forever, and if Albertalli ever decides to write about them again, I will throw a party. Though this is only Albertallis debut, she has just become one of my favorite authors!
Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog Seeker by Arwen Elys Dayton Book One of the Seeker series Publisher: Delacorte Books for Young Readers Publication Date: February 10, 2015 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC sent by the publisher Summary from Goodreads: For readers of A Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games comes an epic new series. The night Quin Kincaid takes her Oath, she will become what she has trained to be her entire life. She will become a Seeker. This is her legacy, and it is an honor. As a Seeker, Quin will fight beside her two closest companions, Shinobu and John, to protect the weak and the wronged. Together they will stand for light in a shadowy world. And shell be with the boy she loveswhos also her best friend. But the night Quin takes her Oath, everything changes. Being a Seeker is not what she thought. Her family is not what she thought. Even the boy she loves is not who she thought. And now its too late to walk away. What I Liked: Im not entirely sure what I was expecting by the time I got around to reading this book. I heard various things from other bloggers that deterred me a bit, not from reading the book altogether, but from reading it sooner. As with all of my review books, I have every intention of reading and reviewing those I request andor receive. I was pleasantly surprised when I enjoyed this book, after putting it off unnecessarily, in the end. Quin and her companions John and Shinobu are so close to taking their Oaths to become Seekers. Quin and Shinobu are ready  their fathers trained them well for this. Quins father, Briac Kincaid, and Shinobus father Alistair McBain, are ruthless Seekers, training them hard. John is somewhat of an outcast  sent to train with Briac at an old age twelve, versus eight. Briac does not allow John to take his Oath, claiming he is not yet ready. But Quin and Shinobu take their Oaths... and discover that the idea of a Seeker is quite different from the actual life of one. Quin is fifteen at the start of the book, and sixteen by the books end. There are several parts to this book. Quin, Shinobu, and John are close to taking their Oaths. Quin and Shinobu take their Oaths, but Briac does not allow John to do so. John is sent back to his grandfather. But John is on a mission to recover something of his family  something that Briac has. So John comes back to the mission and attacks Briac. Shinobu and Quin escape, but Quin is shot, wounded. Shinobu takes her to Hong Kong, where Quin is healed, but loses all of her memories. Shinobu leaves her with Fiona, Quins mother. Months pass... and then John reappears. Shinobu goes back to Quin, one way or another. And Quin slowly starts regaining memories. The first half of the book seemed a bit slow. This was everything before Quin loses her memory. Usually, Im not a fan of books which feature a protagonist losing hisher memory, especially for so long usually, the character gets their memory back, but I think it worked well as a plot device in this book. The first half really set up the world and conflict in the book, but it was a bit slow. Just a note. I thought it was interesting and kind of cool how the author withheld things from the reader, until the end of the book. This book is written in third person, but there are many different perspectives featured. Quin, Shinobu, John, and another character are featured. But the book is completely in third person. So the author CAN withhold information. An important part of the Oath ceremony thing is not revealed until later in the story, for example. I was so curious as to what happened, and when it was finally revealed, I was like OHHH. Makes sense. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the story. Despite the initial lag, I couldnt find myself putting this one down. I told myself Id only have time to read half of the book on one day, and the other half the next day. But I ended up reading the entire book when I started it. Always a good sign. I liked Quin. She is a great fighter and totally meant to be a Seeker. In the beginning, she and Shinobu follow their fathers blindly. John is working under his own agenda, so he always knew better. Quin runs, hides behind her shield of no memories, but eventually becomes a determined warrior. Shinobu is similar  he runs, hides behind the lure of drugs, but eventually, fights back. Johns is an... intriguing character. Like I said, we get his and several other characters perspectives. He may come across as the storys villain, given the synopsis, but if you look at his motives, his intentions are true. He wants to restore his familys honor  whats wrong with that? I really sympathized with John, though I questioned his ways about doing things. Okay, okay, the romance. John has been in love with Quin since they met. Quin has been in love with John since they met. Childhood love is beautiful, but if there is one thing that Ive learned, from YA books, its that if there is love in the beginning of the series, there will almost always be another love interest introduced. Shinobu has always been there, and has always loved Quin, but she never paid him much attention. But theyre running from John, and then Shinobu leaves her memoryless. Confusing, eh? Quin doesnt remember anyone, but comes to know that John is not really a good guy, and Shinobu is trying to help her. So, love triangle verdict: yes. Yes, this book and probably, the entire series has a love triangle. Its not bothering me so much at the moment, because the lines have been drawn especially after reading the very last paragraph of the book, but I can see how the author COULD potentially mix things up. Anyway, the romance wasnt the whole story. The romance isnt a driving factor in this book... maybe for John, but not really. I really enjoyed the story, the world, the high stakes that Dayton has created. Im excited to read book two, Traveler! What I Did Not Like: See what I said above, about the love triangle. Its there. It exists. I dont like love triangles at all, but this one isnt bothering me too much at the moment. I actually like all three protagonists Quin, Shinobu, John, despite one of them being the villain in the book, and one of them being a total drug addict. But... love triangle. Grrr. I think this will come later in the series, but I wanted more in terms of the Seeker business. There was a lot going on in this book, and I hope that the true nature and duty of a Seeker is exposed more in book two. Would I Recommend It: Despite the love triangle, I liked this book a lot. I can see why it has so much attention surrounding it, especially with the movie deal occurring before the first book is published. Id recommend this one to epic fantasy readers who dont mind a more sophisticated kind of fantasy story. Id almost say that this book resembled an adult fantasy fiction novel more than YA, but the age level is YA. Rating: 4 stars. So glad I decided to read this one  and so glad I ended up enjoying the book! Ill definitely be catching the next book in the series, Traveler. And Ill be watching the movie, whenever it is available in theaters!
From:  4.5 stars The Good How to be a Vampire... This is a story about one girls journey after her world is turned upside down. Her life as a scavenger, to her life as a vampire in training, to her life as a wandering vampire who hides amongst a group of humans, hoping, maybe, to be a part of the human world once again. Instead, she finds peace with what she is, monster and all. Lifes a Bitch, Then You Die... Allie hates vampires. They have turned the world into a place of fear and despair. Unless you willingly donate your blood to the blood suckers, you are stuck in the Fringe. A place where you live on the streets and scavenge for food just to stay alive. Not really a life at all. But then Allie is attacked by rabids crazed, mindless vampires and the vampire Kanin gives her a choice: Die or become what she hates the most. Survival mode kicks in and Allie chooses a life as a vampire. But while Kanin is teaching Allie how to be a vampirehow to feed, fight, and surviveKanins past comes back to bite them both on the butt. Now Allie is on her own, traveling the deserted roads outside the city walls. When she comes upon a group of humans searching for a place that is void of vampires and their disease, she decides to tag along, in disguise as a human. And thats when things truly start going downhill. A New Kind of Monster... Though Allies life as a human at the beginning of the book wasnt the most interesting way to start off the story, I was pulled into Kagawas world very easily once Allie became a vampire. At first, I got a whole Daybreakers feel. Though The Immortal Rules idea was very similar to the Daybreakers movie, the more I read, the more I realized that this book was actually very unique for its genre. This wasnt another YA vampire book. The focus wasnt the world Kagawa created or the bad guys within it, this was a story about Allies internal and physical struggle with what she has become. Accepting that she is a monster, but embracing the kind of monster she chooses to be. One that still cares for human life while finding peace with the idea that humans are also her food. She may be a monster, people may fear her, but Allie finds that vampirism actually makes her more human than she was to begin with. She has always been strong, brave, and tough as nails. But Allies new life has put things into perspective. Now she has the understanding how precious life is, even if its an undead one. Adding in her new strength and fighting skills, Allie can do almost anything she wants, and she chooses to help others, to fight, and to live. Zeke... I think each and every character in this book was integral in making this novel so dynamic. The characterization was amazing. The badies were very bad and the goodies were good. But even the good people were confused or a little misguided on what good really is. Zeke was probably the second most important character. His relationship with Allie goes through so many ups and downs, especially since Allie is parading as a human. But eventually her vampiric tendencies start to show. Zeke has been taught that every vampire is a demon who will kill you without thought. Normally, very true, but we know Allie is not that way...Zeke doesnt. So as you can imagine, that whole situation was fascinating to observe. The Narrative... I liked the distinct separation of Allies everchanging path. How she went through huge changes in such short amounts of time, and how this confusing journey affects who she is and who she becomes. If it wasnt for Kagawas awesome ability at narrative, I dont think The Immortal Rules would have worked, especially since the goals within the plot were pretty nonexistent most of the time. Kagawa also knows how to write kickass fighting scenes. The action was so intense that it gave me the chills. The horror, suspense, and character maturity was well above young adult levels, which I think was a great decision on Kagawas part. This book will appeal to both young adults and adults. It has the essence of both. Surprise!!! The mystery was very well done. I never guessed the shocking secrets Kagawa revealed throughout the novel. Its rare that a book can surprise me but The Immortal Rules did. I read this book with a constant sense of excitement. Excitement for Allies growth, for the amazing fight scenes, for the smidgen of romance, and for the possibilities of book 2which this book sets up nicely at the end. I wasnt expecting the dark, gritty, and emotional story that I got. Boy, do I like being surprised. : The Bad The plot and storyline was very vague. There was never any goal Allie was working towards, until the end. I just couldnt grasp the direction of this book. Allie pretty much wanders aimlessly for much of the book. I found the beginning to be boring. There was a lot of background and description that was dumped on us from the getgo and I really just wanted to skip it. Kagawa wasnt very aware of her characters surroundings when writing. For example, Allie would be covered in dirt and blood, and her cloths would be shredded but when she is trying to blend in, no one seems to notice her state of disarray. The Snuggly There is definitely a budding romance in the making, but dont expect a lot of romance in this book. Allie and Zeke are kind of a couple destined to fail, but I would love for them to make it. This is a clean book when it comes to romance. Overall Maybe the plot was a bit vague, but I cant deny that this book pulled me in and never let go. I was expecting another YA vampire story. I got so much more. I was actually going to give this 4 stars but while I was writing this review, I realized that the more time that went by, the more I loved The Immortal Rules. I think the writer in me kept yelling at me, saying the technical parts of this book werent so great. It doesnt follow the rules. Screw the rules! Kagawas storytelling abilities are just too amazing to discount. A highly recommended read. Excerpts If you run, youll be dead before you take three steps. I stopped, heart pounding. I believed him. Gripping my knife, I turned around, staring at him over the bodies of the dead, waiting for his next move. There was no doubt in my mind. I knew what I faced, what stared at me across the tunnel, so still he mightve been a statue. I was down here, alone, with a vampire. And there was no one who could help me.  I swung the light around, taking a breath to shout a warning to the others. Something pale and terrible rose from the grass behind Rat, all limbs and claws and shining teeth. Before he knew what was happening, it yanked him off his feet. I didnt even have time to shout before he vanished into the weeds and darkness with a yelp. Then he began to scream.
Original review: The Daydreaming Bookworm 3.5 Stars! It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover was one of MY MOST ANTICIPATED READS for this month and just like many other devoted CoHo fans, I anxiously awaited for its release date so I could finally have this gorgeous book in my hand. Said to be CoHos best book yet with a powerful message that hit home, I was ready to have my heart ripped to pieces. Unfortunately for me, I did not end up loving this book as much as I thought I would. Dont get me wrong, THE MESSAGE IS THERE! ITS STRONG! I FELT IT! But the story in and of itself was lacking. I felt like CoHo held back, keeping this book from reaching its TRUEST, FULLEST potential. Im quite fond of CoHos beautiful and lyrical writing style that sucks you in and pulls at the heartstrings, but in all honesty, I felt like the writing for her newest release was mediocre at best. Typically, this is the part where I give my own brief summary about the book, but I feel its better to go into this book blind. I went into It Ends With Us not knowing anything other than the fact that this book deals with a lot more heavier themes than her previous works and knowing that alone already had me excited because I am very much a fan of the darker reads. I didnt even read the synopsis, which was a good thing because I dont think it accurately describes what this book is about. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LOVE TRIANGLE! Yes, there are two male characters who our main character both has romantic ties with, but it was never at the same time. I think one of the things that affected me while reading this book was the fact that Ive read so many other books that dealt with this same topic so I couldnt help but compare this book those books I previously read. I am very much aware that this story is based on true events that occurred during CoHos own childhood, but I think we also have to be able to look at the story alone and judge it for what it is, and It Ends With Us couldnt hold a candle to some of my previous reads that deal with this topic. I spent quite a few hours going over everything I highlighted and rereading certain part and I felt like this book couldve been so much better than what it was. The three main issues I had with this books were with: THE PLOT, THE CHARACTERS, AND THE ENDING. The overall plot for this book is WAY TOO FAST! Its only the first chapter and the instalust is real between our two main characters, Lily and Ryle. I found it to be a bit obnoxious. The back and forth banter was not even cute. I hated the fact Ryle completely changed who he was just to fit Lilys ideal dream guy. I didnt feel the connection between Ryle and Lily because of how quickly their relationship escalated. Also, because this book deals with such a heavy theme, the pacing NEEDED to be slower. I needed more time to process all the shit that was going down and because of this, I had a hard time connecting with the story overall. IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH ALL AT ONCE AND I NEEDED A DAMN BREAK LEVER SO THINGS COULD SLOW DOWN. My next problem was with our two male leads, Ryle and Atlas. I felt like their characters couldve been developed more. I wanted to know more about these characters, especially about Ryles past. For some reason, Ryles reasoning for his behavior does not sit well with me. It just rubs me the wrong way and maybe if that part of Ryles life was explored more, I wouldve found it believable, but I just cant. Then we have Atlas, one of my favorite characters. WHY THE HELL DID WE NOT GET MORE OF HIM? Atlas plays a crucial part of Lilys past as he is her first love and he and Lily were both there for each in their time of need, but I felt like this story wouldve been better if Atlas stayed in the past. Im sorry, I know I said hes my favorite and he is, but I dont think his character played a big enough role in Lilys presentday life to have an impact on the overall story. And finally, the ending. The cherry on top because yes, there is an HEA and this also does not sit well with me. It felt forced, predictable...I didnt like it. Aside from my issues, I did feel like CoHo handled the heavy theme that surrounds this story very well. Some scenes depicted were taken from her own life experience and DAMMIT TO HELL, they had me holding my breath. It was not easy to read. I have a lovehate relationship with Lilys character, but I also have the utmost respect for her because the moment she put her put her foot down and took back her life was the moment I got chills. That was indeed a memorable moment and it stuck with me. I also want to touch upon one of the most important part of this book, which is the authors note. CoHos authors notes are always downright moving as she tells us what the inspiration behind her latest book was. This one was more personal. It hit home and brought me to tears. I commend her for writing such a story based on her own life experiences. I said it before and I will say it again, THE MESSAGE IS THERE. IT IS LOUD AND CLEAR! I havent written a review this long in a while, but I had a hard time when it came to rating this book. While it had a powerful and deep take away message, strip this story to the bare bones and it would fall apart completely because it lacks support with its fastpaced plot and onedimensional characters. I expected more, so much more, and I hate to say it, but this one missed the mark for me.
Lunar. Cyborg. Fugitive. Outlaw. Outcast. Okay so i didnt enjoy this as much as i enjoyed Cinder, but it was still a good intriguing read. Being my second read of this book i knocked off a star simply because i wasnt as into it at as the first and the pacing felt a little slower. My old review will be at the bottom, dont judge me on my lack of review it was seriously my second review on Goodreads. Scarlet Benoits grandmother has been missing for two week, she left everything behind including her ID chip. With the police narrowing it down to either a run away, or possible suicide, with no help from the neighbours or townspeople who told them that old Michelle Benoit was known for being crazy. Scarlet never believing this only has her fear risen when her father, who she hasnt been in years, returns to her grandmothers farm in desperate need to find something, rambling in a drunken state about her grandmother, tattoos and secrets. With Scarlet becoming more and more desperate she seeks the help of a new street fighter in the town, Wolf. With Wolfs help she might uncover what really happened to her grandmother, what secrets she might have been hiding and why someone might want to harm her. Prince Kai is struggling with the decisions he has to make, with the cyborg girl who captured his attention still on his mind, questioning everything she said and did, questioning her motives; Kai must do whatever it takes to appease the Lunar Queen and protect New Beijing, which means using the military and anyone at his command to track Cinder down and return her to Queen Levana for execution. Now on the run, hiding from not only Queen Levana but the whole of the world, her escape used as an excuse to start a warattacks on Earth that the Lunar Queen has been threatening for so long, Cinder must stay one step ahead to avoid being captured. Meeting new friends and allies, struggling internally with the truth of her past, trying to seek as many answers as possible whilst trying to control her new Lunar gifts, Cinder must start learning as much as she can in hopes to bring down Levana and save the world. Little Red was a tender young morsel, and the wolf knew she would be even tastier than the old woman. Im going to try to write about a different character each review so its not the same thing over and over and it will give you guys a little insight on characters you may grow to love, if you havent already read this series. Carswell Thorne, or Captain Thorne as he likes to be known, is a smart ass flirt with an ego, and yet he is still extremely likeable, in charming smartass kind of way. An ex airforce cadet with a habit of stealing landed him in prison on a 6 year sentence. A nonjudgmental character, with flaws, makes Thorne a real help and asset to Cinder when their paths cross, even if he doesnt really know who it is he is helping. Although not liking each other much at first, throughout the novel their friendship grows as they fight for freedom and survival, bringing these two closer together and building a friendship that leads them to their fate. A relieved grin filled up Thornes face. Were having another moment, arent we? If by a moment, you mean me not wanting to strangle you for the first time since we met, then I guess we are. A captain always knows where his ship is. Its like a psychic bond. If only we had a captain here. Scarlet Benoit, now im not sure how i feel about this character. At times she is a strong female role with a big heart for family well certain members anyway, and others she can be quite childish and jump into things without thinking ahead and putting herself into stupid dangerous situations. Her relationship with Wolf is a bit insta lovey, although i guess it grows through their adventure,but i just dont really like them together. Its not that they dont suit, i just think their relationship is kinda stupid. Wolf lies, whatever his true motivates were, arent the best base to start a relationship. And the whole wolf hybrid warrior thing, cant control himself , can be controlled, like really Scarlet, smart move there. I dont know guys, i just dont ship these guys at all. I lied to you about a lot of things....but I meant every apology. Maybe he was leading her to her death. Maybe Wolf was marching toward his. In all Marissa Meyer wrote a good novel, not the best in the series, but still captivating and interesting enough to make a reader want to read on. I think the fact the main plot revolved around Scarlet and Wolf, made it not hook me as much. I have mixed emotions about both characters. I also like how the stories all intertwined into Cinders, it adds something to the series, builds the friendships and makes you impatient as fuck so see the next friendship be built and how the characters will meet. I think I realized that I would rather die because I betrayed them, than live because I betrayed you. Recommended for : YAFantasySciFiRetelling.  Scarlet is amazing! Although it did take me awhile to read it , it in no way has anything to do with the quality of this book. The lunar chronicles have me hooked, easy to follow storyline which is great for all ages, brilliant writing and imagination on ordinary fairytales, that personally i prefer to these over the orignials anyday. When Scarlets grandmother goes missing, everyone in town seem to think its pointless trying to find the weird old lady they disliked, she sets out to find out what happened to her beloved grandmother. Only to find that her grandmother may have had more secrets than Scarlet had orginally thought. Crossing paths with a mystrious street fighter named Wolf, she joins forces in hopes for her grand mothers safe return. Meanwhile, Kai is feeling backed to a corner; his father dead and lives of his people resting in his search for Lihn Cinder. In the other hand, death by assination if he decides to accept the queens proposal of marriage and alliance between earth and the planet Lunar. With Cinder still on the run with Captain Thorne, and Iko her former android, now spaceship. Levanas soilders using every resource possible , cinder is fighting for her life and the lives of her friends in another amazingly written story by Marissa Meyer.
First things first. I havent cried this much since one of my most beloved characters died at the end of Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince. So yes, this story touched me and even though rationally I have some reservations towards some of its elements, it still hit me like a freight train, so I wont deny its impact on me. For me, good storytelling speaks of human frustration, suffering, of challenges and overcoming those challenges. Of values. Of the choices people make and their outcomes  the impact of those choices on them and the world around them. Hearing a story, seeing it in a movie or reading it in a book is not just an entertainment device, its an opportunity to learn because of the amazing ability of the human brain to imagine ourselves in the position of the characters, to empathize, or in short, to feel emotion. I can enjoy of course, easy reads, books that are fun and entertaining, but I will always consider a waste any story that has no value, message or real moral to transmit. Forbidden is a book that makes you question your set of values, prejudices, stereotypes, opinions and morals. And just for that reason it is a very good read. I will not summarize it as many people have done it already in other reviews over here, but I would like to share my thoughts and take on one of the major themes found in this book. The consequences of isolation. The two main characters are not only two very young people who were forced to assume roles they were not ready for, but they are two people who keep their family life a secret. And that means living with the pressure involved by the knowledge that no one from the outside should be allowed a glimpse into their real family life. The result of which is a very effective isolation from the social life that a teenager should enjoy. In their eyes, a romantic life is an impossible notion, as it would potentially bring someone from the outside in the world they feel needs to stay hidden at any cost. This is brought to the extreme in Lochans case. Many times during the book he is afraid people would guess his situation or that if he talks to someone something might slip and betray his secret. This is exacerbated to the point where he thinks people can guess his thoughts. Therefore, he isolates himself and the pressure of his hidden reality turns into social anxiety. The relationship between Maya and Lochan is one of deep codependence. As the eldest siblings of a big neglected family, they had to lean on each other their entire lives, raise they smaller siblings all the while maintaining a perfect facade for the outside world . Perfect grades, no unacceptable behaviour at school and the image of a safe environment for their younger siblings  playing down their mother absence and neglect, the lack of money and the pressure of their responsibility. The only person they have ever been honest with was each other. In this utter isolation, their only option for years was each other. You might have already guessed that no, I dont believe in the romance of their falling in love. I dont think that they were meant to fall in love or that being brother and sister was an abberation. I think that their feelings were caused by the desperation and the circumstance of their situation. Playing house together can bring that feeling of partnership that was mentioned several times during the book. Maya and Lochan are not just brother and sister, but are the only ones who really know and understand the difficulty of their situation. And are the ones that have to make sure that no one else finds out. During the time of their life when their personalities, understanding of the world, likes, dislikes and values were starting to take shape, they are raising three children and covering for their mother. This resulted in a belief based on experience that there is no one else for them than each other. I am the youngest child of my family. I only have a bigger sister. At 25 I still see myself as a child. I had a very happy childhood, devoid of any responsibility other than those that any child has: be good in school, behave nicely, not be too messy. So I couldnt pretend that I can empathise too much with the characters. All I had to offer throughout reading of their trials and tribulations was my compassion. And from that compassion, I could only wish for Maya and Lochan to find any kind of solace that they could. If that solace meant a physical relationship with each other, then so be it. But that relationship was meant to further isolate them from the world. Even though it helped in their current situation, it would have done a lot of damage in the long run because it reinforced their belief that they are not allowed to really participate outside of their family . In their circumstance, I really cant judge according to my own values the evolution of their relationship. Even though I dont think I actually agree with the authors voice that I identified a few times during the story, I still feel like I was given the option of forming my own opinion. I felt like the whole controversy subject was formulated in The Life of David Gale style, a very dillematic What if? situation. So what if the relationship between two siblings is consensual? What if they fall in love? What if their situation really doesnt fit in any of the societal stereotypes? These are the most obvious questions that are posed by this story and they are shouted pretty loudly. But given all the other elements that build this story, I really dont think the point was to demonstrate that romantic love can happen between a brother and sister. I think the point of the story was to show that incest can be a very dillematic moral problem when society judges as criminals two people who are doing their best without hurting anyone. I think the point of the story was to show how deeply abandonment, neglect and isolation can affect children. I think the point of the story was to show that a desperate situation will bring desperate measures for people who have formed a belief that theres no other way but to hide. Before I reach the end of this review, I also want to share that I really loved the writing style. It was beautiful, evocative, at times sensitive and lyrical. But at the same time, the alternation between first POVs of the main characters lacked distinction in the inner monologue and it happened that I lost track on whos narrating because their voices were identical. I dont know if that was done intentionally, to show the reader how much alike Maya and Lochan are, but I would have still preferred a 3rd POV narrator that alternates focus between the two characters. I agree with the fact that their monologues were not very realistic for teenagers, but they are also people with very rich interior lives and that have had a different psychological development than normal teenagers that usually borrow a lot of their patterns of speech from their peers. So it was plausible that in their isolation Maya and Lochan would think, speak and observe things differently, their melancholy completely justified. As a conclusion I would like to say, in the words of one of my favorite characters of all time yes, I am talking about Dumbledore  It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be. So, when you open this book and start reading try and see the whole person that the characters personify, not just the roles they breach or the labels they disrespect.
4.5 stars And maybe some people are like collages  no matter how broken or useless we felt, we were an essential part of the whole. We mattered. This book tells such a beautiful story. Ive been hearing about this book on all of my social medias for quite some time now and I saw this book at the library and decided why not give it a chance? Im so glad I did. I was not expecting to like this story so much. These characters feel so raw and real and vibrant. Skylar is a young girl who just graduated from high school and shes going to a university in San Francisco at the end of the summer. But this summer turns out to be a lot more difficult than she anticipated. She and her mother live in a trailer, and she finds out her Mom just got fired from Taco Bell, and they dont have a lot of money saved, and her Mom is a recovering alcoholic. Also, Skylars old friend Josh has returned from Afghanistan where he lost his leg in the war. As you can tell b the premise, this story is pretty depressing. The town Creek View where these characters live is a small town in California just off the freeway in central California where there;s not a whole lot going on. The way the author wrote about their town made it feel so real. I could imagine it perfectly in my head. Its the type of small town where everyone knows everyone and you never make it out and a lot of people are poor and living in trailers and have problems with alcohol and drugs, and the best you can do for yourself is work at Taco Bell... It just all felt so hopeless, reading about this place Skylar hated and she couldnt wait to leave, and then all these terrible things happen and she doesnt know if she can leave. But at the same time the author never talked badly about it in a way thats insensitive to people who do live this way. She just captured the essence of what it would be like to live this way so well. I could feel the depression and hopelessness of never leaving a trailer park jumping off the pages. The thing I thought was most interesting about this book is Skylars relationship with her Mother. Man, can her Mom be a real bitch at times. I have seen first hand what its like for a child to have to take care of the parent and I think its so incredibly sad. A parent should never have to force their child to be the responsible one who thinks about the future and has to make the hard decisions, but that is exactly how their relationship is. Skylar lost her Father five years ago in a car accident and he was drunk. This obviously has a huge impact on her family and it explains why her Mom is the way she is, but still. Skylar shouldnt constantly have to pull her Mom out of this depressing pit all the time. I admire Skylar a lot as a character. Shes smart, she puts people in their place when they act homophobic or racist or rude, she doesnt ever want to drink because thats what caused her dad to die, and she doesnt take shit from anybody. Shes my favorite type of female character. I absolutely hated Billys character her Moms new boyfriend. He was that typical disgusting lame excuse for a stepDad who takes advantage of someone in need. I did like the way that Josh defended her and supported her when it came to some awkward situations involving Billy. I also want to talk about Marge, the owner of the motel that Skylar works at. I love her character in this book and I love her motherly relationship with Skylar. Shes truly there for her when she needs it and shes the kind of Mother that Skylar deserves. Marge has a really sad back story as well her son killed himself when he got home from the war because he couldnt take the anxiety and ptsd, and she found him in the bathtub with his wrists cut and I think this is why she relates so much to Josh and Skylar, and she would do anything to protect them. Skylars relationship with Josh was really sweet. I love how he would ask her: Hows the sky today? in reference to her mood, and she would reply cloudy or rainy or howevr she was feeling. I love cute unique things like that, and thats something I will remember about this book. I love how Skylar is obsessed with collaging and she always talks about these vivid and creative collages shes working on. Its like I can see it in my head because of how well the author writes. I love how her and Josh both know what its like to be dirt poor, and they always go out to eat at McDonalds and Dairy Queen and Subway and thats enough for them. I just like that they seem so normal and average. I absolutely loved the scene where they were dancing in the rain by the pool and the hippies were singing Hotel California. That scene was so adorable and wonderful and I love it. And that song fits their situation with the motel she works at and everything.I also loved the Fourth of July scene where they are sitting at the train tracks and he asks her if she could be anywhere in the world where would she be? And she hesitates and then she says: right here. It was so sweet and I think thats when she realized how much she cares for him. This book had a lot of really cute moments between them that I really enjoyed. As far as Joshs character goes, I have some mixed feelings still. His story of being a marine is heart breaking and its so sad to see him suffering from PTSD throughout this story. Hes only 19 years old and he lost his leg in the war, and thats just so incredibly sad. His life will never be the same. But, there were a few times in this story where Joshs character pissed me off. He makes stupid decisions sometimes, and I understand that everyone makes mistakes, but some of them I was like... come on really? Especially when they were about to have sex and he starts freaking out for no reason and then he just leaves like????? And then he goes to some other girls house to get a blow job... Like wtf Josh? I was so freaking mad about that. Thats bull shit. Like I dont care if you were nervous around her or whatever your excuse is, but to go to some other girls house right after and get a blow job? Thats disgusting ugh. I was really disgusted with his character after this scene. I also was upset and confused when Josh invited her to the bonfire and then he totally blew her off and acted like she wasnt even there. Like way to act like a douche bag? But Im also glad that Skylars character is not a push over and she doesnt take shit from anybody and Im glad she puts him in his place when he needs it. She will literally tell him to stop using his marine story as an excuse and Im proud that she said that because its not fair of him to use that as an excuse for hurting her emotionally. Overall, I really did love this book. I just ordered myself a copy from Amazon because I need it on my shelves. Skylar is a new favorite female character of mine. The ending was okay, I personally thought it ended somewhat abruptly and I wouldve wanted more closure on certain things. I want to know if her Mom did end up moving to Florida with Billy and how that would affect their relationship. I also wanted to have maybe an epilogue chapter after Skylars first year of college to see if this long distance relationship is as easy as they thought. I also wouldve liked if on the last page with her and Josh, if he wouldve asked her: Hows the sky? One last time and then she could say: sunny, or its never been more clear or something beautiful like that idk, I just wanted it to happen because I loved that aspect of their relationship. Other than that, this book was such a surprise with such wonderful, realistic characters. This story will stick with me for a long time.
You may not be beautiful the way you were before, I whispered, cupping his ruined cheek. But youre still beautiful. To me. After reading Undeniable a few months ago, its sequel had become one of the most anticipated reads of the year for me. I had become somewhat reluctantly but nevertheless hopelessly addicted to Ms Sheehan unique brand of gritty romances  her stories, more than any others I have ever read, have the power to completely disconnect me from reality and, in what I can only explain as an outofbody experience, make me feel everything I would never feel in real life. I am convinced that either Ms Sheehan has some Jedi Master mind tricks up her sleeve that we dont know about, or these books have subliminal messages in them because that is the only explanation I can offer my superconfused brain to justify this intense level of enjoyment on my part given the themes and the crudity and explicitness of the scenes in them. The Undeniable series is like crack of the worst best kind, but instead of killing you, it invigorates your imagination, it takes you out of your comfort zone, slaps you a few times for good measure and it pushes the limits of everything you ever believed a romance novel should be like. This is the story of Erik Ripper Jacobs, the Hells Horsemen sergeant at arms, and Danielle Danny West, the Horsemens presidents daughter. Their clandestine love affair starts when Danny is only eighteen years old, during her prom night, when Danny loses her virginity to a man fourteen years her senior whom her father trusts as a brother but would never consider worthy of his eldest daughter. Ripper is a broken man, his scarred body being only a small reflection of the deep emotional wounds festering inside him. The horrendous torture that his body had endured and survived has left him feeling ruined and ashamed of his ordeal, the ugliness that he sees in the mirror reminding him every day that he is no longer worthy of beauty. And, in his eyes, Danny is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen or tasted in his life. Baby, he said gruffly. Man like me got no business with a girl like you. Youre nothin but fckin beauty and Im a whole lot of fckin ugly whos already halfway to hell. Danny does not see the ugliness of Rippers scars. They are as beautiful to her as the man behind them, the only man she has ever loved in her life. Her heart never doubts her feelings for him, she is prepared and willing to scream it from the rooftops, but his reluctance to make their relationship public makes her continuously doubt his commitment to her, thus feeding the insecurities of a young woman in love for the very first time. Ripper, I whispered, clinging to his neck as he carried me from the bathroom into his bedroom. I think I love you. Laying me gently down on his bed, he climbed over top of me and covered me with his body. Yeah, baby, he whispered, sliding back inside of me. Aint no other explanation for what a girl like you is doin in bed with a man like me. When tragedy strikes, their fragile relationship takes the hit, but even through prolonged separation and heartbreak so intense that it will crush you emotionally just reading it, their bond stays as strong as ever and the force of the passion binding them makes their story impossible to put down. Even for a second. Dannys love changes Ripper, it makes him the man he never thought he would become, and it gives him the home he forever longed to have. Nothing comes easy for them as a couple, but their fight for each other is relentless, heartwrenching at times, their story being both tragic as well as ohso beautiful. This might not be a stereotypical romance and yet it is truly one of the most compelling and romantic stories I have ever read. Flipping around in his arms, Danny looked up at him, grinning. Her hair was matted with sweat, her face flushed, her blue eyes shining, and he just stared. She was the most perfect thing hed ever seen, ever touched, felt, kissed. She was the most perfect thing hed ever known. But this is not just a story of Ripper and Danny  this is also the continuation of the torturous tale of Deuce and Eva, and their struggle to finally find the calm waters they so desperately deserve. After decades of ups and downs and having had their devotion to each other tested to the extreme, they are still fighting to stay together, both haunted by old demons and tempted every single day to just run away from everything and escape the heartbreak that their relationship has morphed into. We watch them love each other so deeply but unable to overcome their past. Each scene reminds us why we fell so helplessly in love with these characters, became so invested in their fate and why their story is so addictive. Youre my reason, Deuce, she whispered through her tears. You always have been. Two stories intertwined, each breathtaking in its own right. However, if you are easily offended, dont read this book. If you are happy to stay under the illusion that all heroes should come galloping on white horses and save the helpless heroines, dont read this book. If you do not wish to even entertain the idea of love not fitting a mould and that beauty can come even from the ugliest of contexts, dont read this book. But, if you are openminded, if you value stretching your imagination over any instantgratification kind of romantic scenarios, and if you can enjoy a great story at face value without listening to those little voices inside your head telling you what you should and should not draw pleasure from, then brace yourselves because this book will rock. your. world! Love is a feeling, a real, raw, and unscripted emotion so sensationally pure, unable to dull even under the strain of a world against it, strong enough to heal the broken and warm even the coldest of hearts. Innate. Unavoidable. Undeniable. And sometimes, love is unconventional and it breaks all the rules and blurs all the lines and basks in its glory, shining as bright as the sun, unapologetically glowing even under the narrowed stares of society and its screaming, selfrighteous morals, berating and judging that which it doesnt understand. 4.5 STARS See this review on my blog!

Sometimes, serendipity: The Martian movie came on Netflix Canada a few weeks ago; coincidentally, the book showed up on my librarys New Books shelf last week! I prefer to read the book before I watch a movie, so that has worked out very well. Ive intended to read The Martian for a while now, but it has not been a high priorityI planned to get around to it. As I tend to do with books that suddenly explode in popularity and get movie deals, I wanted to be sceptical. I didnt want to like it that much. That being said, the books origin story means there is something special to it even if that something special isnt something I would see. I am surprised by how much I ended up liking it. Andy Weir certainly slings enough technical details in there for any science nerds appetitebut there is also a complex and nuanced story that leaves you with a lot to think about, both in terms of space travel and being human. Lets get this out of the way: this book is very technically dense. Like, you might think they sling a lot of technobabble in Star Trek, and youd be rightbut there is much more technobabble here, with the added bonus of much more verisimilitude as well. Weir has the expertise and has done the research to back up this attempt to portray as accurately as possible an attempt to survive on Mars solo. Unlike many other novels where the author has done the research so thoroughly they are aching to show all their work, The Martians technical density works. Theres a few reasons for this. Firstly, Weir has most of the narrative taking place as a series of log entries by Mark. As a result, only the interstitial scenes of talking heads at NASA seem Sorkinesque in their intense as you know and idiot ball question moments. Secondly, Weir balances out the science with moments of dry, selfdeprecating humour, as well as moments of profound humility. There is a sense of respect and awe in this book, both for science and space and the sheer audacity of the human spirit. Its probably not very original to compare this to Apollo 13both are stories about disasters in space requiring quick thinking and quick action, and both are more technical than your average science fiction entertainment. Apollo 13, of course, is based on a true story, whereas The Martian is wholly fictional, albeit attempting as much realism as one can muster for a mission to Mars twenty years into the future. Nevertheless, to me what these two stories most have in common is how they highlight the essential fragility of our space travel. Think about it for a moment. Aside from a handful of people who have visited the Moon, which itself is not that far away from Earth in the grandest scheme of things, we have barely left the atmosphere of our planet. Even these accomplishments have taken tremendous effort. And if you pay attention to Mark in The Martian, you can see why: there is so much that can go wrong. One broken component, one mismatched seal, and the whole mission might have to be scrubbed. Physics is a stern and unforgiving tutor, orbital mechanics more so: if you miss your window, burn too much or too little fuel, dont plan ahead far enough ... youre done. There are seldom doovers in space. When you look at it this way, it is a miracle that more astronauts havent died and a testament to the efforts of all the people involved in designing, building, testing, deploying, and managing the complex systems and technologies in place to achieve spaceflight. The Martian lets us be a fly on the wall as that same machine spins up to save one man stranded on Mars. We get to hear about how difficult it is, precisely why it is so difficult, and we learn about all the ways it can go disastrously, horribly wrong for the one way it might go right. Meanwhile, we are left with the sad and tragic certainty that Mark Watney has nothing to listen to on Mars except disco. The poor man. Aside from the technical feat of rescuing Mark, there is also the psychological aspect to the plot. Marks humour, of course, is an obvious draw. I appreciate how Weir depicts Marks varying mood depending on his situation: sometimes Mark is extremely resilient, upbeat, optimistic; after a setback, he might be somewhat down, a little more subdued. As Marks time as the sole inhabitant of Mars stretches on, a sense of deep loneliness settles into his log entries. Even in his most optimistic moments, when everything is going well and he hasnt set himself on fire lately, we get the sense that Mark is just tired. Because Weir shows us rather than tells us, the whole experience is much more evocative. One of my worries and preconceptions going into The Martian was that it would just be the Mark Watney show, that is, Mark would be a huge Mary Sue who is good at everything required to help him survive alone on a planet trying its best to kill him. To some extent the complaint is still valid, lampshaded slightly by the reality that astronauts are selected precisely because they are somewhat like the realworld equivalent of Mary Sues: they are polymaths who excel in not just one but multiple fields, respond well to pressure, have great creativity, and also have grit. Still, few things are more boring than watching a lone American dude talk us through how he was totally da best at living on Mars. This is not the hero I need. Fortunately, that doesnt happen. Marks individual intelligence and resilience are definitely on display. Nor am I going to get counterfactual on a fictional scenario and try to figure out if Mark might have survived and then made it to the Ares 4 MAV if he had never reestablished contact with NASA probably not. However, Weir also emphasizes that rescuing him is a massive team effort something Mark acknowledges explicitly on the order of most of the planet, in a psychic sense if not a literal one. So instead of the Mark Watney show its the combined output of NASA and several other governmental and private institutions, featuring Mark Watney, show. Again, this is much more realistic, and more importantlyfrom a reading perspectiveits more satisfying. It allows Mark to be a flawed character who can make mistakes because someone else is kind of watching his back. I can definitely see how ones emotional investment in Mark might vary. He is not exactly a welldefined protagonist, despite being a dynamic character. For example, although he disparages Lewis seventies obsession and seems neutral about Johannsens Agatha Christie fandom, we learn very little about his likes and dislikes. His sense of humour, his intelligence, his perseverancethese all come through. But if it werent for the narrative device being used, this might almost sound like a recreation of Mark Watneys famous Mars experience rather than the real thing. Combine this with the dense technical details, and I can see why some might pan The Martian as lacking spiritthough I dont agree. As noted above, there is so much spirit to this work if youre looking for it. The Martian is an example of how there is so much good science fiction out there that is so different. Its not going to appeal to everyone, though events obviously demonstrate it has a broad appeal. What matters to me is its depiction of a space industry that feels both realistic and yet also positive. Although Weir probably underestimates the extent to which private companies like SpaceX will have a role in Mars exploration, the very idea that we will send not one but multiple scientific missions to Mars within my lifetime is very inspirational. This isnt the only kind of science fiction I want to read Ill take my Gibsonian technodystopias and Strossian nearfuture political singularities too, but it is a kind of science fiction. The kind that reminds us what humanity is capable of in our greatest moments and encourages us to keep reaching for those dreams.
Originally posted on Daydreaming Books. Spoilery review I cant freaking tell you how much I liked this book. This was so, so awsome. So, Cress is a retelling of Rapunzel, one of my absolute favourites. And the cover is so beautiful! Her satellite made one full orbit around Planet Earth every sixteen hours. It was a prison that came with an endlessly breathtaking view vast blue oceans and swirling clouds and sunrises that set half the world on fire. The plot was seriously brilliant. We swing into action from the very beginning of this novel, during which we meet Cress and get to know the kind of life she lived inside this satellite for almost a decade. She is pretty much naive yet sweet and has so many imaginative ideas of the real world and its people. The gang, i.e. Cinder, Thorne, Scarlet, Wolf, and Iko decide to go on a mission to rescue Cress from her satellite. Things happen and then everything go horribly wrong, causing them to separate. What I loved about this book was it gave the readers the perfect opportunity to get to know each individual character in a more intimate manner. Thorne and Cress end up stranded in the Sahara Desert, which is interesting because Cress has never stepped foot on Earth and being isolated for years didnt exactly grant her the best social skills, and due to certain circumstances on the satellite, Throne is left blind. Poor Thorne. Maybe great, epic romances dont just happen. We have to make them ourselves. Cress and Thorne are utterly hilarious and adorable. I love her huge crush on him, and the disillusionment that follows. I love Thornes charm and the way it plays off Cresss total ignorance of most things and her strong ability to perceive other things. Captain? Yeah? Do you think it was destiny that brought us together? He squinted and, after a thoughtful moment, shook his head. No. Im pretty sure it was Cinder. As for the all the characters, whether there are a main character or a secondary character, I still loved them. Even though with every book Marissa Meyer adds several new ones, it doesnt feel like you get lost at all. Theyre vibrant and so full of personality. For example, Cress is the biggest damsel in distress we have had in the Lunar Chronicles. But by the end, shes different and not the sheltered girl she was before taking orders. Cinder finally has accepted her role and is ready to execute her plan which starts with: Glancing around the room, Cinder tipped up her chin. It starts with kidnapping the groom. Ikos hand shot into the air. Yes, Iko? That is the best idea ever. Count me in. Iko is one of the best characters ever. She is my favourite. Although she is only an android but she is totally full of sarcasm and humour and I love her spunky personality. See? Injustice. Here we are, risking our lives to rescue Kai and this whole planet, and Adri and Pearl get to go to the royal wedding. Im disgusted. I hope they spill soy sauce on their fancy dresses. Jacins concern turned fast to annoyance. Your ship has some messedup priorities, you know that? Iko. My name is Iko. If you dont stop calling me the ship, I am going to make sure you never have hot water during your showers again, do you understand me? Sheeesh, see, she is awsome! In this book we see a little less of Wolf and Scarlet because something major happens with Scarlet, and Wolf is mostly in a grumpy and sad state which Im not going to spoil it for you guys. And lastly, Kai, Im so glad they kidnapped him. I kind of never been so glad with anyone elses kidnapping before. :P Bending his head, Kai pressed his lips to her knuckles. The plating had no nerve endings, and yet the touch sent a tingle of electricity along her arm. Cinder? Mm? He lifted his gaze. Just to be clear, youre not using your mind powers on me right now, are you? She blinked. Of course not. Just checking. Then he slipped his arms around her waist and kissed her. Cinder gasped, pressing her palms against his chest. Kai pulled her closer. Her hands tentatively made their way to his shoulders, before stringing around his neck. TOTALLY EPIC. FINALLY!! So, basically this was the moment we all have been waiting for and it finally happens in this book. There was the right amount of anticipation before we finally get to see the kiss which was basically, totally, absolutely perfect. Too much quotesy review, eeh? I couldnt help it! They were all simply awsome. The writing was great as usual, simple and straightforward. It was so difficult to put this book down for a single second. Im so exited to see how Cinder starts a revolution in Luna with the help of everyone and finally defeat Levana. I am usually a fast reader but with this book I wished I could read even more faster and I really wish it didnt end. But sadly it did and now I have to wait for the last and final conclusion in Winter which is going to be released in November 10th, 2015. Six freaking months. How am I gonna survive? The Lunar Chronicles is definitely my new favourite series. Recommend it? Oh dear lordie, ABSOLUTELY!
If you are looking for a whirlwind journey through America during the summer of 1927 Bill Brysons ONE SUMMER, AMERICA, 1927 is for you. If you are interested in the minutiae of the period and want to be entertained by some of the most important and amazing characters of the twentieth century this is a book that will be a wonderful read. As a historian who is very familiar with most of the subject matter I found very little that was new. There are neither citations nor footnotes and the only attempt at providing the reader any source material is a chapter by chapter brief bibliography of the most important secondary sources on a particular subject. A part from this issue the book should prove to be very satisfactory to the general reader. Brysons goal is an attempt to present the historical importance of the summer of 1927. This he achieves as he discusses the many notable names of that summerRichard Byrd, Sacco and Vanzetti, Gene Tunney, even Charles Lindberghwho rarely encountered now, and most of the others who are never heard at all. So it is worth pausing for a moment to remember just some of the things that happened that summer: Babe Ruth hit sixty home runs. The Federal Reserve made the mistake that precipitated the stock market crash. Al Capone enjoyed his last summer of eminence. The Jazz Singer was filmed. Television was created. Radio came of age. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed. President Coolidge chose not to run. Work began on Mount Rushmore. The Mississippi flooded as it never had before. A madman in Michigan blew up a school and killed fortyfour people in the worst slaughter of children in American history. Henry Ford stopped making the Model T and promised to stop insulting Jews. And a kid from Minnesota flew across an ocean and captivated the planet in a way it had never been captivated before. 4278 It was that kid from Minnesota, Charles Lindbergh who seems to be Brysons central character. Though the book begins with a gruesome murder on Long Island dubbed the Sash Weight Murder case involving a Mr. and Mrs. Albert Snyder whose story disappears and reappears throughout the book, a device Bryson uses with all of his characters. Once the readers interest is enjoined, Bryson presents one of his major themes, the history of American aviation. Through the eyes of Charles Lindbergh and other aviators the author recounts the trials, tribulations and overwhelming success of the flyers of the period. We are presented with intimate details as Lindbergh prepares and carries out his historical flight from New Yorks Roosevelt Field to Paris. Bryson dissects Lindberghs life as tries to cope with his popularity, which he did not seek, and a personality that came across as awestruck but was much more complicated. Lindberghs role in the launching of the American aviation industry is not in doubt as was his hero status that soon became tainted in the 1930s as he was linked to proNazi views and he pursued an extremely isolationist platform before the United States entered World War Two. The development of eugenic theory receives coverage and it is interesting to explore these extreme racial views that were widely accepted in the 1920s and juxtapose them to those of Charles Lindbergh. The second most important character Bryson presents is that of Babe Ruth. The authors discussion of the Great Bambino uncovers no new details of his life and baseball career. Bryson intertwines a history of Broadway Theater in his discussion as the owner of the New York Yankees, Jacob Ruppert purchases Ruths contract in 1920 from Harry Frazee, the owner of the Boston Red Sox who was more of a theater impresario and needed the money to help pay off some of his loan payments. The reader is treated to details of figures such as Al Jolson, Clara Bow, Oscar Hammerstein, the theater sensation, Show Boat and many others. It is part of Brysons technique to bring up a character or topic and then fit in a number of other areas of interest that he spins off from. So with Ruth we get the burgeoning entertainment industry with the first talkie film, The Jazz Singer, the rise and fall of prohibition, the growth of organized crime centering around Al Capone, and the race situation in America that grew increasing nativist in the United States and allowed the author to extrapolate on immigration and anarchism resulting in the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti that summer. Speaking of executions, the reader is offered a minibiography of Robert Elliot who developed the electric chair execution process making it less tortuous for its victims. In fact, Elliot became so popular that most federal prisons competed for his services and he had the responsibility of executing most if not all of the major criminals of the era. The summer of 1927 was also part of a period of cultural change. We learn that the Book of the Month Club came into being the year before and was soon followed in 1927 by the Literary Guild. Tabloid journalism reached new levels that summer as new magazines and newspapers appeared. America seemed to be reading much more and Bryson does not neglect the likes of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and others who influenced Americas literary culture. The mood that existed that fateful summer of course is approached politically and economically through the lives of Herbert Hoover, Calvin Coolidge, Mayor Big Bill Thompson of Chicago and others. We see the lassaizfaire capitalist approach of Hoover as he responds to the disaster that befell Middle America as the Mississippi River overflowed its banks in what John Barry describes in his book, RISING TIDE: THE GREAT MISSISSIPPI FLOOD OF 1927. The reader witnesses decisions by economic leaders worldwide that will contribute to the collapse of the Stock Market shortly thereafter and the role, or lack of a role of government in policing the titans of Wall Street. In fact had Alexis de Tocqueville visited America in 1927, not a century earlier, instead of writing a book entitled DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA, it may have been entitled, UNCONTROLLED LARGESS IN AMERICA. The reader is presented the expanding manufacturing industry as new appliances, entertainment vehicles, and other inventions that enhanced the home appeared. Bryson does include some of the most outrageous occurrences of the times. My favorite was in discussing prohibition, under pressure from the AntiSaloon League led by Wayne Wheeler the government put poison in random liquor bottles to enforce laws against drinking. Bryson quoting the book, EATING IN AMERICA that 11,700 people died in 1927 alone from imbibing drink poisoned by the government. 161. A further example that struck me was the acceptance of certain racial views by prominent figures of the period. Herbert Hoover was a strong believer in eugenics and even Supreme Court Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes, former president, William Howard Taft, and the liberal Louis D. Brandeis voted in favor of sterilization in Buck v. Bell. If you are a practitioner of trivial pursuits, circa the 1920s, it would enhance your game by reading Brysons journey through that age. All in all I reiterate this nook is an entertaining and at times fascinating look at the period for the general reader and I am certain as with all of Brysons works it will be a commercial success.
Buddy Read with Charlie They took away her beautiful clothes, dressed her in an old gray smock, and gave her wooden shoes. I cannot even think of how I should begin this review... So let me try and use GIFs since I havent used GIFs in my reviews for a while. This book just really knocked it out of the park for me. And I have high hopes that the rest of the series will too. I havent been this excited about a book series since the Grisha Trilogy by Leigh Bardugo that I read last year. After reading the first paragraph from this book, I knew... I just knew it was going to be love. THE GIST Once upon a time, there was a cyborg girl who lived in New Beijing named Cinder. Half of her body is a machine and the other half remained human. I know you guys already know what a cyborg is but just thought Id say it anyways. So right now, she lives with her stepmother and two stepsisters. She doesnt really know who her real parents are. All she remember was that she was adopted to the family by her stepmothers husband who is now dead sadly. Her adoptive father has been nice to her, unfortunately, her stepmother was not. Legally, Cinder belonged to Adri as much as the household android and so too did her money, her few possessions, even the new foot shed just attached. Adri loved to remind her of that. Basically, she was treated like a maid just like in the original Cinderella story. Oooppss. I forgot, this is a retelling of Cinderellas story.. But you guys would have figured it out by now seeing her name and the stepmother and stepsisters scenario. Anyways, she works at the market as a mechanic, a good one at that. She is so good that the Prince of the Eastern Commonwealth visits her to ask if she could fix his android. She was met with startled copperbrown eyes and black hair that hung past his ears and lips that every girl in the country had admired a thousand times. Yes. The prince is indeed a pretty boy. Lol. But he is a pretty nice guy too. I think I should stop here because things might get pretty spoilery after this. But just when you think this is an ordinary retelling, you got it so wrong. THE PROTAGONISTS Cinder What? Really? And I thought I was just emotionally withdrawn. She pulled her feet up, hugging her knees. Im also incapable of blushing, if that was going to be your next brilliant observation. I love Cinder. I wasnt expecting to absolutely fall in love with her character but I did. She was sarcastic, brave, caring, responsible and everything i love in a character. She was also one that is flawed. She isnt a fucking Mary Sue! Thank you so fucking much! You dont see her as a special snowflake that would save the world. You will see her as this damaged girl literally and figuratively who just want to fit in. Who just want to be accepted for who she is. For some reason, cyborgs were abhored in this society. Im not sure if i missed the part where it was explained, but Im not sure why she should be bothered about being an cyborg. The things she could do is so awesome. Oh and by the way, she doesnt let those pesky teenage hormones rule over her decisions. This girl has a good head on her shoulders. One other thing too, Cinder does doubt herself sometimes, but then again, who doesnt? She gets insecure but being in her position it was quite understandable. Cinder is definitely one of the nicely written female character I have ever read. Prince Kai I think you should go to the ball with me. She clutched her fingers. His expression was too genuine, too sure. Her nerves tingled. Stars, she muttered. Didnt you already ask me that? Im hoping for a more favorable answer this time. And I seem to be getting more desperate by the minute. Prince Kai was charming. Honestly, I dont think this guy has any faults on him. He was such a sweet guy and loyal and responsible. We dont often see guys like him in books anymore. We almost always see the badboyturngoodguy type and sometimes I get sick of that. Kai was just so nice. And his struggles are very much shown too. His motivations and actions are well thought of. I liked that he wasnt put there just for the sake of having a romantic interest. THE ANTAGONISTS QUEEN LEVANA She was so good. I liked how intimating she was even when she wasnt saying anything yet. Although at this point in the series, I dont get why she was evil. But I do want to know and thats what made her an interesting character for me. ADRI LIHN Now we go to Cinders stepmother. She is so evil. I actually kind of hated her a bit more than Levana on this book because she has no heart. Im not saying that Levana has one, but on this book you get to see how she interacted with Cinder and how badly she treated her. I just wanted to strangle her all of the time she was in the book. THINGS I LIKED The world building was just amazing. I love her concept of New Beijing and the Eastern Commonwealth. I felt that it lacked a bit of describing of the environment but I just loved this world. How futuristic but current everything is. How people could be cyborgs and how people use androids which are basically Artificial Intelligence and also about the humans relationship with the people from the moon.. Yeah. There are people from the moon. The characters were so well written. Everyone is really fleshed out as if they were real human beings. You get to know them and their motivations and you understand them. I dont think there are characters here that were unnecessary to the story. All of them had their own roles to play and luckily, all of them did it wekl. Cinder as the protagonist is one of this books highlight. She is not what I was expecting. She wasnt a Mary Sue. She was bitter and hopeful at the same time. I just loved her. There was instalove but not really. And I actually found it really cute and sweet. I mean anyone would probably be in love with a prince right? Lol. I liked how the story progressed. It will keep you reading for more. I liked the pacing of this book. It was exactly how I wanted a fantasy book to be paced. I surprisingly liked that this was told in multiple, third person point of view. I usually prefer first person, but I liked that this book was in a different POV that I am used to. It has good villans. I think the main villain for the entire series is Queen Levana but Adri even if she was a smaller scale evil person is still a great addition to the evil people of this book. Marissa Meyers writing is so good. I am in love. THINGS I DIDNT LIKE I like being suprised by books. This book had so many foreshadowings that it was so easy for me to guess the plot twist in the book. And true enough, I was right. FINAL WORDS I cant recommend this book enough to people who like YA fantasy books. It is everything I wanted to see in a YA book. Theres a fantastic heroine, a goodhearted love interest, a scary villain, and a great world they belong in. Im currently reading Scarlet and so far it is as good as Cinder, although as a character, I still think Cinder is a better one. The second book actually introduces you to more characters to love and root for. Im not going to ask anymore because I know most of you have already read this book. What are youre thoughts about it? Did you like it, hate it, or arent sure? Leave some of your thoughts down below.
From:  The Good Read Hard and Put Away Wet... Okay, I have been sitting her for 10 minutes and I still dont know what to write. I guess it is fitting since Divergent left me speechless. How do I write a review about a book like this? A book that revitalized me, a book that made me bite my nails for the first time in 3 years, a book that ripped out my heart and made me want more. My face actually hurts from the emotions I went through. Ive been caught smiling like an idiot, crying like a wuss, laughing to near hysteria, and waving my hands around from nervousness all while reading Divergent. I swear I found a new wrinkle between my eyes because I read this book so HARD. You ever do that? Reading a book hard is when you squeeze the cover from anxiety, rip the pages in your haste to see what happens next, and having to actually get up and stand while you finish a scene because of your nervous energy. Oh yeah, everyone in my household knows that if I am reading standing up then that book is the BOMB! Dont laugh because I used the word Bomb, I am totally bringing it back. Choose a Faction... Beatrice lives in a world where one of five virtues dictates the rest of a persons life. Once someone turns 16, they must decide which faction virtue they will live with the rest of their lives. You have a choice between Candor the honest, Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Amity the peaceful, and Erudite the intelligent, but once a faction is chosen, there is no turning back. That faction is your family, your only family. Beatrice loves her family, but she struggles with the choice of staying with them within a faction that no longer suits her or going with the faction that has fascinated and called to her most of her life. Finally gaining the courage, she leaves her family, joins a new faction, and renames herself Tris. But the hard part is not over yet. Tris must now survive the horrifying training process, cruel initiates, and political intrigue that might just bring destruction upon the faction system. Tris... I dont think this book would have been the same without Tris. It is her that takes us on a journey of selfdiscovery, the concept of virtues, and the trials one must go through to be accepted. Her struggles between being selfless, brave, and intelligent at the same time were captivating. Its hard for her to be just one, but she knows showing signs of too many virtues can get her killed. She was so meek and small in the beginning that her surviving the training seemed impossible. However, she was like a blooming flower in the sun, the more she was exposed to the life of her new faction, the more she became stronger, resilient, and flourished in her new surroundings. I think any of us could look up to Tris not literally, that girl is short as all getout. She never gave up no matter how much she was hurting or felt unwanted. I Am Number Four... Four is the kind of person youll love and hate through most of the novel. Hes a bit mysterious, somewhat caring, and a whole lot intimidating. He goes through these moods. One day hes as sweet as pie, then the next he is nicking your ear with a knife true story. But underneath his mood swings, he has a heart that beats for Tris. His goal is to help her survive the new cutthroat world she has been thrust into, even if that means being her enemy from time to time. I liked finding out about Four in short bursts of emotion. His background and his true motives stay a mystery for a good chunk of the novel. Of course, this made him all the more interesting. Its the End of the World as We Know It... The concept behind Divergent is undeniably frightening and intriguing at the same time. In this dystopian world, war has been eradicated by simply cultivating the best virtues that any human being can poses. But in Divergent they have separated these traits into factions that live apart. The problem is, acting in accordance to one virtue does not guarantee a peaceful society. Eliminating peoples innate kindness or mercy to be brave or doing away with a conscious selfworth to be solely selfless leaves people open to attack on many fronts. What makes us human is the ability to experience all that life has to offer; to be brave when its necessary or honest when its appropriate. To focus on only one part of yourself can warp your ideals into something dangerous. That is whats happening in the world of Divergent. Factions are being corrupted. And if the one faction meant to protect you is unraveling, what do you do? Maybe, just maybe, Tris and her uniqueness will be able to fix what has taken place and find a way to triumph over the darkness in the world. I guess we shall see as the trilogy goes on. A Punch in the Gut... I was shocked by the direction this book took. We do not get a happy endingat least not yet. The initiation Tris goes through was nerveracking on its own, and then Roth decides to punch us in the gut by bringing the world down around our ears. It was a nice surprise because it only made me want to read book 2, Insurgent, even more. The plot was well structured, the pacing perfect, and the suspense was phenomenal. I was terrified for Tris most of the time. I felt her emotions as she struggled to become what her faction required. The fear of her fellow cruel initiates was a constant throughout the book. The betrayals against Tris hit me just as hard as her. The astronomical changes in her left me out of breath and craving more. Every multidimensional characterthe bad guys, the good guys, and the inbetweenerscontributed to this amazing story. Roths ability to write such outstanding fiction at her young age gives me hope as a young writer myself. The Bad The only thing that bugged me was when Tris forgave people that I think were unforgivable. There was some major backstabbing in the book, and no matter what happened to those people, I wouldve never forgiven them. But maybe Im just pigheaded. The Snuggly The romance is pretty minor. It takes quite some time for Tris and Four to get together. I like the fact that Tris is not very attractive but Four likes her because of her strength and determination. It gave their relationship a solid foundation because they grew to respect each other first. Id say the book is pretty clean except for some unwanted sexual touching. Overall I actually have Insurgent on the way to my house right now. I couldnt wait to read book2, and since it took me so long to read Divergent, I didnt have to wait but a couple of days. Roth did an amazing job of taking captivating characters and a kickass and compassionate heroine, throwing them into a terrifying world, and adding just enough political corruption, action, and drama to produce one hell of a read. This is not the kind of book you can pass up. Any adult or young adult out there will fall in love with Divergent. Its a must read! Excerpt I hear the crash of water against rocks. We are near the chasmwe must be above it, given the volume of the sound. I press my lips together to keep from screaming. If we are above the chasm, I know what they intend to do to me. Lift her up, cmon. I thrash, and their rough skin grates against mine, but I know its useless. I scream too, knowing that no one can hear me here. I will survive until tomorrow, I will. The hands push me around and up and slam my spine into something hard and cold. Judging by its width and curvature, it is a metal railing. It is the metal railing, the one that overlooks the chasm. My breaths wheeze and mist touches the back of my neck. The hands force my back to arch over the railing. My feet leave the ground, and my attackers are the only thing keeping me from falling into the water.
 Versions Owned: ARC, Paperback, Hardcover, UK PB purple, The Gathering Dark UK title  4.5 stars Initial Thoughts 82612:I really loved Shadow and Bone! The concept was interesting and uniquely put together in a way that had me racing through the book to see how it all came together. I really enjoyed the characters and I loved the twists that Leigh Bardugo involved in the plot. Overall a really enjoyable read! Full review originally posted on The Book Addicts Guide 9512: Once again I find myself singing the praises of high fantasy! Id seen tons of praise for this book pretty much everywhere and after seeing Leigh Bardugo at Andersons Bookshop first on the Fierce Reads tour in June and again at Andersons on August 30th although I actually finished the book before then!, just seeing her personality and hearing her talk about the book and how she came up with it really drove me to get into the story. I absolutely loved the development of the Grisha and the story behind their history and abilities. It seemed utterly magical but as we learn more about the talents, theres a little bit of practicality mixed in as well. It was really interesting to learn about and I found it quite unique. Another thing I really enjoyed is that the romance aspect isnt overdone. We first learn that Alina has developed a crush on Mal in the very beginning of the book, so thats something we already know, but since Mal is also her best friend and pretty much only friend, that also makes him so much more to Alina. Hes incredibly important to her and its not just a lust factor. As for The Darkling..... well thats just a pure lust situation! So yes, I really loved where the story went and I loved how it all came together in the end! Leigh Bardugos writing was also extremely enjoyable and I loved the new elements that she brought to the story. Reread reactions 51214: Wow, this was so much fun to reread! I did so via audio so it was a new experience and so much fun to live through all over again. I feel like the second half was definitely the stronger half with more action, more romance, and more suspense. Obviously I enjoyed both, but things really pick up towards the end and just really get exciting! So happy I did a reread and I honestly cant wait to start Siege and Storm all over again too! This book still proves that this series is one of my favorites and just brought up all those FEELINGS all over again. ReRead Review originally posted HERE on The Book Addicts Guide 61814: This was quite the interesting reread for me... I think this was the first reread in which I had two totally different expectations going into it: When I first picked up Shadow and Bone almost two years ago !!!, I was not a fantasy reader. I think I had read Graceling first and that was about it, so I wasnt expecting much in the way of a new fantasy book and it turned out that I loved it! I was really scared going into the reread this time because I had since fallen in love with this series and was afraid that the reread just wouldnt be the same. Honestly, I did read the book entirely differently. Well, in two ways  I bought the audiobook from Audible because Ive started to really enjoy doing my rereads via audiobook and also because I been obsessing over the series for two years now and all of the THINGS that I know, Im able to pick up on so much more with a reread. I must say, rereading SHADOW AND BONE really proved to me how amazing SIEGE AND STORM was. As someone who wasnt a fantasy reader before, I very much appreciated the whole revelation of having powers, learning how to use them in that almost boarding schooltype setting, and the romances involved but reading all of these things a second time and especially after reading SIEGE AND STORM came across totally differently. Honestly, TOTALLY. For one, I already knew Alina had powers and exactly what they entailed, so I wasnt as interested in the figuring out process so much as paying attention to the other details that I may have glossed over in my first read. The whole learning process actually wasnt as appealing to me the second time around, I think because I really already knew how it happened so I was ready to dive into more character development of secondary characters which didnt happen as much in the first book as it does in the second. SHADOW AND BONE is very much about Alina and about Mal and about their ties to the Grisha so my impatience didnt exactly pay off haha. But of course, it was still enjoyable to go through that experience again! I read the romance aspect of this book entirely differently the second time around. During my first read, I did not get what was the big deal about Mal. I liked him and I loved his friendship with Alina but I didnt fall for him or the Darkling, really, but thats another story the way other readers did. During my reread. YEAH. MAL. IM THERE. I really got to know him better in SIEGE AND STORM so that made my connection in this reread stronger but WHOO BOY, that best friend romance thing going on there.... fans self How was I not more into this during my first read!? I dont understand. Because best friends falling for each other is a trope that I luuuurve and I was totally on board with it during my reread. I also felt less lovetriangley about the Darkling because knowing what I know now, it seemed more like a power play than a romance and I had it in my head that way more happened than it actually did in the book. Since I already knew about the worldbuilding side of the book, I did pay more attention to the romance this time around which hadnt really seemed to play a big part for me during my original read. Speaking of world building, that was something I really enjoyed even more. The more I read about this world, the more I fall in love with it. Its always a little difficult to get a grasp on a new world with unique and foreign names so now that I know a little more about the Grishaverse, I really got a hold on what happens where and exactly whats involved. As far as plotting and characters go, obviously now I know their connections, but even then I was formulating new theories about the Darkling and why we dont know his name yet and what if its related to or connected to characters weve already met and dont know it?! I think I enjoyed my original read a little bit more than the reread but I am even MORE anxious to reread SIEGE AND STORM and Im still salivating over RUIN AND RISING and dreaming about how its SO CLOSE. Im still in love with this world and this series and it will be bittersweet to end in June but I still cant wait!
A Dark Time Comes. My Time. If it Offends you, Stop Me. This one line from the book tells you everything you need to know about Jorg. Or this one, Hate Will Keep You Alive Where Love Fails. I think I understand why this book receives so much hate. Jorg Ancrath is basically the amalgamation of Roose Bolton and Joffrey Baratheon from Game of Thrones. I know, its a little difficult picturing something so grotesque, but Jorg is actually infinitely worse because he is the hero. We all love antiheroes but, My God, Mark Lawrence really pushed the limits here. And you can sort of understand the hate, especially from readers that forced their way through all 400 pages of Prince of Thorns because of all the praise the novel has been attracting for the last few years. MY REVIEW: Okay, lets take a closer look at Prince of Thorns. I havent read a more controversial novel in a long time. And it makes you wonder. What did Mark Lawrence actually want from us? This is neither the hero we want nor the one we deserve. Yet it is the hero he gave us. Except he wasnt a hero. Jorg is a villain. Which makes you wonder. What sort of reaction did Lawrence want to evoke? Prince of Thorns is a surprisingly complex story. Written from the first person perspective, it is a comingofage tale of sorts the worst kind about a boy that bends to the corruption of the world, becoming the vilest of villains in an effort to avenge the death of the only people he ever loved, this while seeking his fathers approval and making a name for himself as conqueror, King and Warrior Necromancer?. Why you Must Read Prince of Thorns Here are three reasons to read Prince of Thorns, and YES, I very much recommend this book: 1. Jorg In hindsight, Jorg is probably no worse than Bolton or Joffrey Maybe!. Except he is. Why? Because Jorg knows better. He understands the difference between right and wrong, moral and immoral. And he walks his dark path because he chooses to do so, rejecting every chance of salvation. For that, you hate him. Yet he wasnt always that way. More importantly, Jorg doesnt have to be that way, and he knows that. And it is in trying to understand his actions, the factors that drove Jorg to become the monster he is, and the elements compelling him to consistently commit atrocities that this book proves so complex. You cannot like Jorg. And I say that as someone that actually tried. He is a villain, deserving only the most painful of deaths for his many crimes. Which is why you have to commend Mark Lawrence because, as much as you dislike Jorg, you cannot hate him. Unforgivable as his actions might be. Lawrence finds a way to drive you towards rooting for him, if only for a moment. There is an element of unpredictability as a result because you never know what kind of Jorg you will get with each new chapter, and which emotions he will evoke. Its a fun, albeit frustrating, rollercoaster ride. 2. Writing Style I hate the first person perspective. Theres something restrictive about that whole approach that irks me, which is why I have made a point to shun almost every book written in the first perspective that I have come across. But I think Mark Lawrence has won me over because his writing style just works. Simple, elegant, easily comprehensible and evocative. Prince of Thorns is such an easy read, yet not so simple that the author seems to be speaking down to you. I might go so far as to call Mark Lawrences writing pleasant. You are compelled to keep reading. 3. The World Prince of Thorns is set in such a dark and violent world. Certainly, if you are a little squeamish, then this book simply wont do for you. However, beyond the blood and the gore, the book also creates an intriguing universe, filled with mysteries, magic, and political intrigue. You get just enough of a taste of the supernatural to know that it infuses some aspect of the real world. Yet the magic never really overtakes the realism. The story is still wholly grounded in the natural world, so much so that the supernatural aspects are treated more like a delightful treat you cannot help but look forward to. There is a twist in this book that I didnt see coming. I thought I knew where we were in history. Then a sudden revelation shattered my expectations and revealed the truth. Why You Might Avoid Prince of Thorns If I am being honest, Prince of Thorns isnt for everyone, and I can see why some people outright hated it. There are conflicting fantasy novels out there, which thrive on creating morally gray situations within which characters can play. There is nothing morally gray about Prince of Thorns. The book is outrightly dark, and some people might find the depths to which Mark Lawrence descends a little unappealing. Think about this: Jorg, the primary protagonist, is 14 years old. Now ask yourself if you are comfortable reading about a 14yearold pillaging villages, eviscerating perfectly innocent peasants, and raping at least one helpless woman during his adventures. If any of that sounds distasteful, then, yeah, Prince of Thorns will disturb you. VERDICT Mark Lawrence created Jorg purposefully for us to hate him, and he succeeded because, outside of the scenes with his father who might be the foulest character in fantasy history, second only to Bayaz, Jorg is completely irredeemable. But, believe it or not, that is what makes Prince of Thorns work. As terrible as you think Jorg might be, there are people out there who are actually worse. As such, Prince of Thorns boils down to a battle of the vilest. From my point of view, Prince of Thorns is a mustread because it is so drastically different from most fantasy novels out there. Even if you hate every second of your experience, you are better off forcing yourself to slog through Prince of Thorns. Theres something to appreciate. Admittedly, I found Jorgs ridiculous levels of competence in almost all fields a little irritating. That he seemed almost too capable is the one issue I have with Prince of Thorns. This is the closest book to Joe Abercrombies First Law Trilogy that I have read. The finale really surprised me, mostly because I was dreading certain Fairy Taleesque situations. But to my surprise, my fears were unfounded because Lawrences finale is actually quite solid. There was a point near the end, during a particularly decisive battle, when I was prepared to throw my book away if Jorg won through sheer force of will.

Both Shahrzad and Tariqs missions collide into a web of betrayal, heartbreak and longing of things neither of them can have. KYNNDRAS THOUGHTS Wow. WOW. Now I can completely understand the hype that surrounds this book. Please note that I am writing this at nearly 2 A.M. directly after finishing said book. I was going to wait until the next day to review, but I just couldnt. My feels need to be explored and vented about The Wrath and the Dawn, cause holy son of mother that was one hell of a book. ONE HELL OF A BOOK I SAY. Beware, this is more gushing than anything else. But I cant be bothered. Let me start with the bad. Ha! Just kidding, there is no bad. Just a personal issue. It took me a good eighty or so pages to adjust to the rich culturistic aspect of the story. Every time Id come across a term I didnt know Id have to google it because Im a curious little moose and have to be able to envision what Im reading. Unfortunately I didnt realize until the end that there was a glossary, so incase you read this book and youre thinking you wont understand a few terms or objects then yee just turn to the back and BAM your issue is solved. In the end I really loved that the story had a prominent bit of Persian culture mixed in. I learned a lot of things and was able to have a colorful imagination while reading! I have no idea what the original story is  Ive never read the tale that The Wrath and the Dawn was birthed from but I sure as hell want to. Although, Im kind of glad I wasnt familiar with the story because everything was a surprise. Let me start by saying that I wasnt sure at first if I would like it. I was doubtful, I was foolish. I waited too long to read this book. The story was brilliant and enthralling. I was fascinated as to why this young king would take a new wife every day, only to kill her at dawn. I had to keep my nimble little fingers from flipping to the end to find out. But UGH THE FEELS WHEN I DID. I loved every second. The plot kept me on my toes, I genuinely can say I was clutching my phone which I read on 85 of the time struggling to stay calm. It was a whole bucket of frantic desperation and panic. Plus the writing was simply breathtaking. Theres so many quotes that made me incredibly happy or thoughtful. Renee Ahdieh is a poet, a weaver of nothing but beautiful prose. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME, YOU PLAGUE OF A GIRL? HE WHISPERED. IF IM A PLAGUE, THEN YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR DISTANCE, UNLESS YOU PLAN ON BEING DESTROYED. NO. DESTROY ME. THE ROMANCE was my everything. Its all I need. No instalove. Just a good old heartbreaking romance that clutches on and doesnt let go. Khalid had my heart since page one, and Shahrzad quickly followed suite. A damaged boy falls for a girl who gives him air. I DONT GIVE A DAMN WHAT HES DONE. I ship these two more than what is probably considered healthy. I adore both of these characters for different reasons. Theres so many moments between these two that was pure PERFECTION. Tariq can piss off. I dont care about him, not one bit. Other than him, the secondary characters brought a lot of life to the story as well. My personal favorite is Despina Shahrzads handmaiden who was a complete gift to the world. Full of sass and snark which enhanced my love even more when the girls became friends. God, I cant emphasize how much I enjoyed the secondary characters. In short, I just need the second as soon as I possibly can. I know I say it a lot, but I NEED THIS SEQUEL ASAP. Such a treat this book was. IN CONCLUSION The Wrath and the Dawn was an unexpected gift upon the literary world. With its enchanting plot, mesmerizing writing and a passionate romance it will surely be an unforgettable retelling for ages to come. The world and the characters were a rich pleasure. Adding a dash of magic and mystery produced a fantastic retelling of The Arabian Nights by the gifted Renee Ahdieh. I simply cannot wait for its sequel, The Rose and the Dagger. May could not come sooner.
From:  4.5 stars The Good How to be a Vampire... This is a story about one girls journey after her world is turned upside down. Her life as a scavenger, to her life as a vampire in training, to her life as a wandering vampire who hides amongst a group of humans, hoping, maybe, to be a part of the human world once again. Instead, she finds peace with what she is, monster and all. Lifes a Bitch, Then You Die... Allie hates vampires. They have turned the world into a place of fear and despair. Unless you willingly donate your blood to the blood suckers, you are stuck in the Fringe. A place where you live on the streets and scavenge for food just to stay alive. Not really a life at all. But then Allie is attacked by rabids crazed, mindless vampires and the vampire Kanin gives her a choice: Die or become what she hates the most. Survival mode kicks in and Allie chooses a life as a vampire. But while Kanin is teaching Allie how to be a vampirehow to feed, fight, and surviveKanins past comes back to bite them both on the butt. Now Allie is on her own, traveling the deserted roads outside the city walls. When she comes upon a group of humans searching for a place that is void of vampires and their disease, she decides to tag along, in disguise as a human. And thats when things truly start going downhill. A New Kind of Monster... Though Allies life as a human at the beginning of the book wasnt the most interesting way to start off the story, I was pulled into Kagawas world very easily once Allie became a vampire. At first, I got a whole Daybreakers feel. Though The Immortal Rules idea was very similar to the Daybreakers movie, the more I read, the more I realized that this book was actually very unique for its genre. This wasnt another YA vampire book. The focus wasnt the world Kagawa created or the bad guys within it, this was a story about Allies internal and physical struggle with what she has become. Accepting that she is a monster, but embracing the kind of monster she chooses to be. One that still cares for human life while finding peace with the idea that humans are also her food. She may be a monster, people may fear her, but Allie finds that vampirism actually makes her more human than she was to begin with. She has always been strong, brave, and tough as nails. But Allies new life has put things into perspective. Now she has the understanding how precious life is, even if its an undead one. Adding in her new strength and fighting skills, Allie can do almost anything she wants, and she chooses to help others, to fight, and to live. Zeke... I think each and every character in this book was integral in making this novel so dynamic. The characterization was amazing. The badies were very bad and the goodies were good. But even the good people were confused or a little misguided on what good really is. Zeke was probably the second most important character. His relationship with Allie goes through so many ups and downs, especially since Allie is parading as a human. But eventually her vampiric tendencies start to show. Zeke has been taught that every vampire is a demon who will kill you without thought. Normally, very true, but we know Allie is not that way...Zeke doesnt. So as you can imagine, that whole situation was fascinating to observe. The Narrative... I liked the distinct separation of Allies everchanging path. How she went through huge changes in such short amounts of time, and how this confusing journey affects who she is and who she becomes. If it wasnt for Kagawas awesome ability at narrative, I dont think The Immortal Rules would have worked, especially since the goals within the plot were pretty nonexistent most of the time. Kagawa also knows how to write kickass fighting scenes. The action was so intense that it gave me the chills. The horror, suspense, and character maturity was well above young adult levels, which I think was a great decision on Kagawas part. This book will appeal to both young adults and adults. It has the essence of both. Surprise!!! The mystery was very well done. I never guessed the shocking secrets Kagawa revealed throughout the novel. Its rare that a book can surprise me but The Immortal Rules did. I read this book with a constant sense of excitement. Excitement for Allies growth, for the amazing fight scenes, for the smidgen of romance, and for the possibilities of book 2which this book sets up nicely at the end. I wasnt expecting the dark, gritty, and emotional story that I got. Boy, do I like being surprised. : The Bad The plot and storyline was very vague. There was never any goal Allie was working towards, until the end. I just couldnt grasp the direction of this book. Allie pretty much wanders aimlessly for much of the book. I found the beginning to be boring. There was a lot of background and description that was dumped on us from the getgo and I really just wanted to skip it. Kagawa wasnt very aware of her characters surroundings when writing. For example, Allie would be covered in dirt and blood, and her cloths would be shredded but when she is trying to blend in, no one seems to notice her state of disarray. The Snuggly There is definitely a budding romance in the making, but dont expect a lot of romance in this book. Allie and Zeke are kind of a couple destined to fail, but I would love for them to make it. This is a clean book when it comes to romance. Overall Maybe the plot was a bit vague, but I cant deny that this book pulled me in and never let go. I was expecting another YA vampire story. I got so much more. I was actually going to give this 4 stars but while I was writing this review, I realized that the more time that went by, the more I loved The Immortal Rules. I think the writer in me kept yelling at me, saying the technical parts of this book werent so great. It doesnt follow the rules. Screw the rules! Kagawas storytelling abilities are just too amazing to discount. A highly recommended read. Excerpts If you run, youll be dead before you take three steps. I stopped, heart pounding. I believed him. Gripping my knife, I turned around, staring at him over the bodies of the dead, waiting for his next move. There was no doubt in my mind. I knew what I faced, what stared at me across the tunnel, so still he mightve been a statue. I was down here, alone, with a vampire. And there was no one who could help me.  I swung the light around, taking a breath to shout a warning to the others. Something pale and terrible rose from the grass behind Rat, all limbs and claws and shining teeth. Before he knew what was happening, it yanked him off his feet. I didnt even have time to shout before he vanished into the weeds and darkness with a yelp. Then he began to scream.
I posted a spoiler free review on my YouTube Channel: Click HERE to watch You can read my original review published to my blog thatgirlbookworm Sourcebooks was kind enough to send me an advanced papercopy of this book for review. This is a spoiler free review. Death brings life, life brings death. A simple quote, that perfectly sums up the book. This book is about a school shooting. It follows the story of 4 students who tell the story of what happens, and the why it happens. Its a story about people coming together through the death of their friendsclassmates, and people getting torn apart by those deaths. 4.5 I have always been interested in the psychology behind school shootings. I want to know why, what makes someone decide to take all their anger at the world out on their fellow students. Most school shooters end up dead by the end of everything, so Ive never been able to read anything on why it happens. In fact, the only school shooting I know of where the shooter survived happened at my school many years ago. All this being said, Ive done quite a bit of research on school shootings, have read many books written on it Newtown and Columbine being just 2 of them and therefore was immensely excited about reading this. When you approach a topic like this in writing, a book that will no doubt be controversial because of its subject matter, you have to do it well, or not at all. I am so glad to say that Nijkamp did this topic justice in my opinion. She creates these characters and this atmosphere and situation that you feel to be real. It was gripping and suspenseful and the entire time you read you just wait to see who else will die, and how this will end. It was an intense journey and I found myself needing frequent breaks to just take everything in and not get overwhelmed with the topic. I had a few issues with the book. And before I start with this section I just want to add a bit of a disclaimer. I find it much easier to discuss things I dont like, rather than things I do. Not because I enjoy hating things which I dont hate anything in this book but because when I talk about things I love I get very repetitive and redundant, whereas I find the words flow better when I am discussing why I didnt enjoy something. These issues arent things I would necessary change about the book, or things that really impacted my reading at all, they are just little things that I feel like could have been excluded without impacting the entire story. The primary one was the romance aspects of the book. This is a spoiler free review so I wont give details, but there were a few romantic moments or developments during the events of the school shooting that I found to be out of place. This story felt incredibly real and realistic but during those romantic moments there was a feeling in me of hey, this wouldnt happen if there was a real school shooting. I wouldnt really know if thats true because Ive never experienced it, but its how I saw it. Another small issue, and this issue isnt actually anything about the book specifically, its actually just me not seeing the purpose of its inclusion and those are the twitterblog posts between each chapter. It helps to create a sense of chaos because no one knows what is going on and the helplessness of not knowing anything, but because the characters in them were not recognizable to me, I just wasnt sure if I liked them. Its very clear what the is trying to portray with this story, which is a story of a school shooting, how it affects various people and the things leading up to it. The thing is though, I feel like to get that fully, especially the why it happens, it I would have liked just one point of view in the shooters POV. Perhaps the last one, just to get a sense of why. There are a lot of different things that happen in their life and I would have liked to really know what it was specifically that happened because I felt like the other few characters were unreliable in telling me, and the only person really capable of doing that was the shooter themself. Again, not an issue with the book, I adore everything included, I just would have liked that perhaps the author will release something in the future of that sort. Things that I absolutely adored in this book was the emphasis on the positive ways social media has impacted our world today. In this horrible time of crisis, this is the only way that some people are able to contact their family. As well, the characters are stunning in this novel. Tomas was my favourite character, along with his friend Fareed, and while some of what they do I felt to be a tad unrealistic, I loved their bravery and overall attitude in this story. Sylvia was another favourite, I adored her story and her background and her part in everything. Claire and Chris were an interesting take in the story. I adored that their story was a bit different than everyone elses and I liked to see this angle of the school shooting story. Autumn was a character I just could not connect with. She was incredibly real, and her part in the book was probably the most important, but I just found myself not liking her like maybe I should have. I didnt hate her, at all, but I didnt love or adore her like I did the other characters. The end was beautiful. Yes it was also heartbreaking definitely, but also beautiful in its own way. I feel like regardless of anyones thoughts on this book, you have to admit it is a powerful story that makes you think. It makes you wonder how you would react in this situation, it makes you think about the hundreds of people who have been through the same thing, and it makes you realize that this could happen anywhere at any time. This is going to be a must read book of 2016 and I hope that everyone takes the opportunity to read this book because its so worth your time.
Quite a few fans of the series have told me that they hadnt been interested in Butchs story and that it was a disappointing read. The weakest entry into the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. Either because there was too much side stories taking away from the main couple, or they didnt like Butch and Marissa. Um, hello! Butch was the only human male character in the series and I found him completely fascinating. For me Butchs official book was the one I had been dying of curiosity to read about. Not just because he was the only male human, but because hes been a favorite character of mine since book one. Butch and Marissas tango consumed me from the first book. Even Butchs disturbingendearinghilarious stalking warmed my heart. From the last book I was bleeding for Butch as he wants to be in the foray with his brothers. But he knows that he is still an outsider. It comes as no surprise that Butch would get a loop hole to become a vampire. In the end Butch has enough vamp blood in him to be turned, I was slightly disappointed by this my first go around. But I dont mind it so much now. Even if having a human as part of the group tickled my fancy. Maybe because the emotions and need for him to become part of the Brotherhood really hit me hard this time. Oh, and you wont believe who is blood line related to! Butch makes a great member of team blood suckers. Really. Besides things arent all hunky dory. At the beginning Butch goes through some scary shit. Hes forever changed, but it also opens the door way for a new stage in the war between The Virgin Scribe and the Omega. Im getting a strong feeling that with this series a lot of the relationship issues are mainly due to the characters not communicating. A couple of times I got frustrated with Butch and Marissa when the thing that would have solved their issue was a quick sit and talk. What do I know, tension makes the drama! AND miscommunications is the key ingredient to any dramaticangst filled romance. Marissa is an interesting character. I feel like I should be annoyed with her. However, she embodies the issues that the glymeraAKA vampire societyhas. This is old school sexist shit. The kind of stuff that makes my blood boil. Which makes Marissa such an amazing character. As she is forced away from the life that has repressed her. Its painful to realize how less she thinks of herself because of what society thinks she should be. I was moved as Marissa decides to do what she wants to do, and to make herself happy. Sure there were moments that I just wanted to bang my head against a wall. But then I realized this was the first steps of a rebirth for glymera and its sexist ways. Lover Revealed touches on how bonded males arent perfect, that domestic abuse is very much real in in vampire society. Its refreshing to see reality touch home here. Making these books legitimate and not so much some silly dark fantasy. Especially as it emphasized how easily women in the glymera are property with no true rights. I cant wait to read the later books to see womens rights transpire in the glymera. Especially concerning the Scribe Virgin. As always Ward is fantastic at including side stories. John Mathews side story was really engaging. The reader gets to follow him as his rage finally gets turned into grief at the lost of Tohrment leaving. Hes getting closer to the transition and the brothers are trying to help guide him. Zsadist makes fantastic little appearances as he tries to help John out. Its kind of sad as John struggles to accept his muteness, and he sees it as a weakness. But I adore that he finally gets some friends. As the trioJohn, Qhuinn, Blaylockare not only one of my favorite storylines but characters. Rhev and his head of security make a very interesting story here and Im ready for the dirt on sympaths already! Mr. X has been reinstated as the head Forelesser and hes out to find a permanent way to end his undead life, he does not want to go back to the Omega. Mr. X was the very first lesser we were introduced to in Dark Lover. I really enjoyed his story as he tried to find the keys to a prophecy that would give one man the power to devour lesser and really kill them. The fact that an evil guy like Mr. X was trying so desperately to escape the ultimate evil. The irony was not lost on me. Though I truly felt sympathy for the poor guy. Last time I found the story between Vishous and Butch really interesting. Well this time I was moved. Oh, my gosh. Bravo Ward. Bravo. Vishous comes to the conclusion that his feelings for Butch are deep. Not just Best FriendIdDieFor deep. But Idsellmysoultoprotectyou deep. Love that knows no gender. What I love is that once Butch realizes it the truth doesnt faze him. On some level hes known all along. Not to mention after a certain scene in the last book. Its explored that if Marissa wasnt in the picture there could be something between the two. My heart broke. But I truly love Butch and Marissa together. Ward does a wonderful job showing this love triangle some compassion, and Im thankful. I truly enjoyed it. It was handled with aplomb. Ill be the first to admit that I had a lot of frustration with Marissa and Butchs love story. Though I realize because of who they are it makes perfect sense. The inability to talk things out and just jumping to conclusions always annoys me. Not to mention that Butch again has thoughts about how angry hed be if Marissa was no longer a virgin. How he couldnt handle someone else feeding her even though he knows he can trust her. Otherwise this was a great story for Butch and I loved his backstory. Especially the family past. The whole side story of Mr. X was really fun as well as he tries to make the prophecy come true, and getting more details on the Omega was really interesting. As usual all the side stories are fantastic! Its one of my favorite things to see in PNR and I love that it continues throughout the series. This one was a little lighter then the otherswell coming off of Zsadists story it isbut its still dark and edgy! Man am I looking forward to heralding changes in the future books. Sexual Content: Humor, bedroom scenes, minor homosexual themes, and some other darker themes about rape. Also deals with domestic violence. A very realistic take on sex and losing ones virginity. 55 Fabulous, a beautiful obsession! Originally reviewed at Book Whispers. Initial review from 2010.

I am diverging from the way I usually review books because there is so much to say and the format is too restricting. ACOTAR was released quite a while back, but I never read it. Dont ask me why I dont really remember. Yet, it was always on my TBR and just three days back, I started reading the book. I am not going to review ACOTAR because, well, I have so much to say about ACOMAF. Let me just begin by saying HOW AMAZING THIS BOOK IS! There was so much going on in this book and so much this book made me go through. This book was exquisite in its joy and sorrow. It made me angry, made me cry, made me laugh, made me feel for the characters. Gosh, I am running short on words. The characters go through such development and its all so natural, it was amazing to read. The themes in the book were so very strong. Themes other YA books steer clear from yet Maas centered the book AROUND trauma and PTSD and so much more. Anyone who loves to read fantasy should read this book. Heck everyone should read this book! Plot: 55 Characters: 55 Pace: 55 Overall Rating: 105 Have you read the book? If not, you should! And once you have, come back and talk to me, please! I have so much to say. :D Spoiler filled discussion starts below! Please do not continue reading if you havent read both the books. Youve been warned. AFTER AFFECTS OF TRAUMA Trauma is bad. The effects of trauma are bad and scary and leaves people feeling lonely. I have never come across a book that speaks about trauma so thoroughly! Feyres struggle was very raw. They way she suffered was not sugar coated or brushed under the rug. It was what the first half of the book was ALL about. I didnt really see it in the beginning, in ACOTAR, but the depression and struggle had started in the first book itself! But ACOMAF makes that struggle much rawer and powerful. I am so very thankful to Maas for speaking about mental illness through a FANTASY book! But more than that, I love how she shows its more than just knowing how tragic trauma is, but its possible to overcome the trauma and be stronger! RELATIONSHIPS breaths before I rant Tamlin and Feyre I was definitely shipping Tamlin and Feyre in ACOTAR. I wouldnt say I loved Tamlin, but I did love Feyre. The love and dedication she had to Tamlin were commendable. Everything she went through for him, mentally and physically left me feeling hopeless for her. I wish I could help her! But that strain of Aramanthas trials broke Feyre. And watching her die broke Tamlin. Though, like I mentioned, I didnt see it myself in ACOTAR. With ACOMAF though, the brokenness in both these people was evident and very obvious. I think I started disliking Tamlin when I read that he wouldnt wake up when Feyre was puking her guts out in the middle of the night. No matter what unspoken understanding they had, I would never want my partner to leave to alone with my demons! And when he locked her up? That shattered the lit bit of hope I was still holding out for Tamlin. I remember rereading a few things after that happened and realised that throughout ACOMAF he kept getting worse. He refused to train her, he said a High Lady doesnt exist, he came to her only when he needed her. I then went on to read how locking her up put her back into the darkness and that was the last straw for both Feyre and me. I could have kissed Mor and Rhys for what they did to protect her. And I realized  I realized how badly Id been treated before, if my standards had become so low. If the freedom Id been granted felt like a privilege and not an inherent right. Rhysand and Feyre Now for my favorite literary couple! 3 The dynamics between these two was so natural. I loved that they became friends first and fell in love later. What I loved most though was Rhys giving her a choice every step of the way. No judgement and a lot of support. He knew Feyre was his mate and yet he would let her walk away if thats what she wanted to do. And yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice. I sipped from my wine. And if he had grabbed me? There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. Then I would have torn apart the world to get you back. The very first week in the Night Court he told her about the upcoming war. I am sure he had an inkling of Feyre mentioning all that to Tamlin but Rhys told her anyway. Once she was in the Night Court for good he showed her his treasured secret  Velaris! He challenged her, pushed her to train, he pushed her out of her dark place not just in ACOMAF but in ACOTAR as well! They become friends over the course of time, I challenge and one thought at a time. If you were going to die, I was going to die with you. I couldnt stop thinking it over and over as you screamed, as I tried to kill her: you were my mate, my mate, my mate. But then she snapped your neck. Tears rolled down his face. And I felt you die, he whispered. Tears were sliding down my own cheeks. And this beautiful, wonderful thing that had come into my life, this gift from the Cauldron...It was gone. And when she finds out Rhys is her mate? Oh, my god! He comes to her, gives her the choice to STILL reject him but she doesnt. And they are PERFECT! Im definitely Ferhys all the way!! In the end, they have grown so close that they work together without saying anything aloud. God, can I say my heart was beating like crazy when their bond was broken? 3 BUT then there was good news and I swear I scream from joy! My mom thought something was wrong with me. I also got a whack on my head. But it was worth it! :D ..Not consort, not wife. Feyre is High Lady of the Night Court. My equal in every way; she would wear my crown, sit on a throne beside mine. Never sidelined, never designated to breeding and parties and child rearing. My queen. OTHER CHARACTERS This post is already very long, but I cant miss out on the other characters! The Court Of Dreams Squad is what I call them. They are so perfect in their imperfection. They are the family Feyre needed. They felt like family to me as well, to be honest. The bickering, the fighting and the love and protectiveness were all there. I loved how easily they let Feyre feel like she was a part of their circle. They involved her in everything and protected her the way they would protect each other. Welcome to the family, Feyre. And I thought those might have been the most beautiful words Id ever heard. Nesta and Elain were sisters I loved as well. Especially Nesta! Her strong spirit and her protectiveness over both her sisters were beautiful. Sure she didnt show much protection when it came to Feyre but it was there. It was there between the lines! I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS BOOK, BUT I WILL STOP RIGHT HERE. DID YOU READ THE BOOK? DID YOU LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DID? WHAT WERE YOUR FAVORITE MOMENTS? WHAT ARE THE POINTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS?
This review can also be found on A Thousand Lives Lived, check it out for more reviews! Oliver gets me every, single time. From Before I Fall to Delirium, she simply just knows how to image a readers hopes and dreams for a YA book into a real thing. After reading this, I felt as if Ive vanished... into a world of sisterhood and death. That whole paragraph had to be bolded, let me tell you. Now that Ive just finished this book as Im writing the review, Im unable to forget about the chapters and me, anxiously flipping the pages, wanting more and more. Its all over now, and I cant believe how quickly an author can get a reader hooked to their delivered writing. I feel that Lauren Oliver makes a different story every time, from her heart. Maybe she dreamt of this, of two sisters who were once friends until they were separated by a boy, until one sister goes missing when no one expected it. Maybe she just came up with it when she was sitting at her kitchen table, drinking a cup of coffee. Maybe she thought of it when she was grocery shopping. It doesnt matter, because Oliver can simply write a novel and well all love it, no matter what the fudgely fudge itll be about. With her books, its like she sends a special UPS delivery with this book into our hearts. Sometimes people stop loving you. And thats the kind of darkness that never gets fixed, no matter how many moons rise again, filling the sky with a weak approximation of light. Yeah, Im one of the happiest fellows in the world after reading this. IT WAS LIKE A PSYCHO PARTY the whole time through. As you know or you may not, Im the biggest fan of psychological thrillers. Theyre my favourite kinds of books, and I find that Im always lurking for a new one to warm my heart and get me to read under the blankets with every single day. This was a perfect example of a wellwritten psychologicalthriller that kept me guessing. And since Im not the master of figuring out the ending, I was shocked, repeatedly. Dara and Nick Warren are two sisters who were once best friends who told each other everything and always seemed to include each other in their lives no matter where they were. At the same time, they are complete opposites where Daras always looking for attention and for trouble, while Nick does great in school and always sticks up for the people who she loves. When Dara hooks up with Nicks best friend, Parker, their bond is immediately broken as Nick once felt something for Parker, and now thats all taken away from her. When a nineyear old in their town goes missing, everyones shocked, but then Dara disappears as well and Nick knows that it must have something to do with the other case. This definitely can be said to be a poignant read. I, for myself, am heartbroken with the ending, but at least it wasnt predictable. It had shed a light onto me, getting me to wonder what the real meaning of beingthereforsomeone really is, and if it matters. The concept was hitting me hard, and Im cheering for more. The fact that Oliver added the vanishing of Dara in the end of the middle made this even better, as we expected her to go missing on any page and we kept going with the story, sticking up for both girls in their struggles and rough times. Youd probably expect these girls lives to be perfect other than the struggles that they are having to deal with each other. But, its definitely not. Their parents are getting divorced, and Nick doesnt know who she should stick up for, when her mother is taking pills all the time and isnt herself. Dara feels that she has no real friends and anyone she could really trust, where Parker keeps on breaking up with her. Life is a fucking waste, they feel at times. But the point of their stories was for readers to feel the emotion and that theyre there for the girls, sticking up for them, patting their head and letting them know that its all going to be okay. For his perfect lips and his smile and those stormy eyes and the fact that even standing next to him I can feel an invisible force moving between us. Magnetism, my chem teacher would call it. The seeking of a thing for its pair. I can tell you that the plot was pieced perfectly. It took the stand to get to the circumstances of a contemporarythriller in the perfect pacing and readers knew that we would get there. Its not like Oliver made the story eerie and absurd from the start with rolling eyes moments. This was real, with a tragedy noted in the beginning, but them trying to move on. There werent any boring moments whatsoever, and I felt connected. Thats a definite A for relating. Nick was a character who I can relate to. Looking at the way that she dealt with things was simply in a matter that I see myself doing as well. She realized the kind of sisterhood that she had with Dara, and how much she loved her. Even through the end, she felt that she will always be there for Dara, in spirit or not. And for her love life, I love the way she dealt with it all, and how she wanted to take things in a slow pace. Dara, on the other hand, was the opposite of me. I didnt like her. She was absolutely annoying and looking at the fact that she didnt see how much Nick loved her kept punching me in the face. She was a thief Parker and she didnt care about her family. She was stupid, and although I understood some of her pain, she took things too far and had so much angst in her that she was ready to explode. I loved how we never would know why she vanished... Parker and Nick were perfect. I love boygirl friendships, and I can tell you that I was totally envious of the connection that they shared. I never was in a kind of oppositegender friendship like they had, and it got my heart aching as the bond that they once had broke, and mended again because of the disappearance. Like I always say, bad situations can lead you to good ones, even when you dont expect them. Parker was a guy wholl always be there, hanging a red flag, waiting for you to come along even when you dont feel like it, because you always will. I am almost left with nothing inside of me, as this book has clogged and vacuumed all of my emotions away from me. The writing and plot were perfect, and so was our kickass character of Nick, but something was missing in the end. Maybe if the relationship between Nick and Dara against their parents wouldve been stronger, then I wouldve had more emotion left inside of me? If they cared which they seemed to not, I wouldve been more happy with the ending? Because really, all who cared for Dara were Nick and Parker. I cant seem to think of anyone else who wanted to hug her and let her know that theyre doing everything for her. But really, in the end, this definitely is a book of 2015 that everyone will remember, if they felt for Dara and her story or not.
This review, and many more, can be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca. My Thoughts: Often times when a book is so critically acclaimed Im a little hesitant to pick it up because more often than not the book just doesnt live up to the hype created around it. Yes, Ive become a little cynical in my reading. This is not the case with Wonder. Not by a long shot. In fact two words that I initially wrote down after reading the first few chapters of this book were: touching and emotional. Its because of the emotion and message behind this book that Im so excited to share it with you. First of all, Im shocked and more than a little impressed that this book was written by a first time author. I think that a huge part of the success of this book is that Palacio has given Auggie and the five other people who provide the narration truly authentic and believable voices. Auggie is an inspiring, funny and strong main character who will definitely stay with me for a long time. Palacio has created a sympathetic main character in Auggie who is a normal Star Wars loving boy with an extraordinary face who you cant help but root for. Hes got a great support system at home which has instilled a strong sense of self and he uses his humour to deal with other peoples issues with his face. He is exceptional in that he feels normal even though other people have more of an issue with his face. I know Im not an ordinary tenyearold kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary, I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids dont make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids dont get stared at wherever they go. If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that lookaway thing. Heres what I think: the only reason Im not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way. This book could very easily do a tailspin into a very woeful read about bullying. Sure it has its emotional moments but it doesnt have a generally sad feel to it. Its actually a very uplifting read and has a much more simplistic and innocent approach to it that I wasnt expecting. If youre looking for a gritty account of what life is like living with a severe facial deformity then this wont be the book for you. While there is a strong moral message in the book it never felt like Palacio was pontificating or shoving the moral down the readers throat. Its a simple lesson: be kinder than you have to. I would hope that we all realize that we should be nice to everyone even if we dont do it enough but this book clearly shows the reader that the negative effects of looking away or pretending we dont notice someone with a noticeable deformity is just as damaging as saying a mean statement. It was an emotional read at times I even shed a tear or two! but never had a saccharine or overdone feel to it. Its because of the moral message that I think that this book should be read by middle school kids. I honestly think everyone should read it but kids in middle school would get the most out of it because I think it accurately portrays the effects of bullying, of ignoring someone based on their looks and shows how little it takes to just be a friend and uplift someone. To do what is right, not necessarily what is the easiest, or what others think you should do. Those are some pretty big lessons that I think ALL of us need to learn or get a refresher course on. Overall I truly loved this book. I was fully emersed in Auggies world from the beginning to the end and found it to be a very touching read. The story is told by these six characters with the use of short chapters that really helped to keep the pace moving. But what really stood out with me is the ease and success that Palacio had using various points of view  Auggie and FIVE others  to tell the story. This could have been a literary train wreck with the number of POVs but it was done extremely well giving the reader insight into those around Auggie and how he and they experienced things differently. I especially loved his sister, Vias, point of view and her conflicting feelings towards her brother and all of the attention he gets from their parents. She adores her brother but the effects of his facial deformity, his numerous surgeries and how others react to him greatly influences her life. Palacio also shows how other people in Auggies life, namely Jack and Summer, deal with other insensitive and downright cruel people who judge them for hanging out with Auggie. I did have a couple of small criticisms about the book. One thing that did strike me as not quite right were the language and issues that these Grade 5 kids had to deal with. As a mom to kids in Grade 4, 6 and 8 Id like to think that I have a handle on the voice and development of tweens. Based on that experience with my Small Humans I think that the social issues that were dealt with in the book are more in middle school Grades 68 than in an elementary school setting. I dont think that Grade 5 students are nearly as developmentally advanced as Jack, Auggie, Summer etc were portrayed in the book. I think having the kids be in Grade 7 would have been a more realistic age where they would have experienced the peer and social pressures dealt with in this book. My other issue with the book is that perhaps because it had a lighter feel to it the ending was also more uplifting and a little too tidy for my liking. The bad guy got his comeuppance and the good guys all rode off into the sunset. These are small beefs about the book wee moos, if you like but they were noticeable and may bother some readers who were hoping for an edgy ending. Overall, I loved this book and found Wonder to be truly wonderful. I adore the moral of the book that encourages people to be kinder than necessary and that people have not only the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness. Hopefully, after reading this book people will choose to be more respectful and kinder to others even when its not convenient for them or when it makes them feel uncomfortable. To give others dignity. Imagine the kind of world wed have if we all did that. Kinder than is necessary. Because its not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed. Highly recommended. My Rating: 4.55 stars
Second read in 2017 Probably more of a 4 star book in hindsight, but still so very good! I love it and the characters, and I cant wait to finally read Wayfarer. First read in 2015 This was my first Alexandra Bracken book, and it will NOT be the last! There is something so gorgeous about her writing, and the way she wove together the past and present. Im not a huge fan of timetravel books, even though I love history, because the mechanics of it can just fly over my head. But there were no infodumps here, no ridiculously longwinded explanations. That aspect of the book, the timetravel, was easy to understand and believe. But the characters? Oh, the characters were my favorite part! Henrietta Etta Spencer first appears to be this obedient, quiet girl. One who lets others choose her path, and one who puts the violin above everything else. But she loves playing. She loves the discipline, even though it makes her a perfectionist who cannot stand mistakes. But when tragedy strikes, and life unravels, she starts questioning her choices and reevaluating whats important. And she no longer has the passion for the violin, though she wont back out of honoring her loved one. Thats when shes pushed through time and thrust into the year 1776 and sent on a quest that she has no choice but to accept. Through it all, Etta doesnt give up. She doesnt cower and she doesnt lose hope. She fights; she survives. She uses her skills, her mothers stories, and her intelligence to save her skin and that of a boy who is dealing with his own troubles. She was well within her rights to break down, to just let herself be pushed around. But Etta was so strong, though she had her moments of weakness, especially when it came to her short temper and stubborn rebellion and her blind curiosity.Her growth was absolutely wonderful and I loved her character. Nicholas Carter is a pirate who is so much more than meets the eye. We meet him in the middle of a fullblown war on the waters, in the middle of him killing someone Its like OH HAI NIC... WAIT WHAT. Hes rough around the edges, quiet, contemplative. His eyes take everything in even when his mouth is done speaking. And hes someone who gets the job done, and his job currently? Bringing Etta to the Ironwoods. But he knows hes essentially throwing her into the lions den, so he stays to protect her, just in case. And because of that, and Ironwoods offer, hes tossed throughout the centuries with her, on the quest for a mysterious object whose origins are covered in lies. Nicholas doesnt have much trouble assimilating, even though hes never felt like he truly belongs anywhere. But with Etta, he starts to understand what love and home and life feels like, what it means to belong. Because of his race and his past, hes never been able to shake off the feeling of helplessness and the constant insults thrown his way. But Etta sees past all of that, and looks inside, to a guy who just wants to be worth something. Their romance was slow and sweet and agonizingly beautiful. In each other, they both find a place to belong, especially when theyre torn from their homes and tossed into worlds that are constantly trying to push them down. Through it all, Etta and Nicholas are forced to depend on each other, to put their trust into someone they just met. It helps form a connection between them, and they start to care for each other, even when that trust is tenuous at best. The love that develops between them was so real and genuine, a love that gives them something to fall back on when they dont know what to do or how theyll get out of the mess theyre in. A love that shows both Etta and Nicholas that appearances arent everything, and that the heart is what counts. I loved how Alexandra used this book to tackle the subjects of feminism and slavery, of race and prejudices. Throwing a 21st century girl into the heart of a time where women were considered the inferior gender was certainly bound to create sparks of anger and rebellion. I loved that Etta didnt stand for it, that she questioned the laws, and that she stood up for Nicholas even when she was told to be quiet. Because of the slave laws, Nicholas being born to a woman in captivity left him branded a slave too. Its a label that has never gone away, even when hes proven himself over and over again that hes a good, hardworking man. Its a label that Nicholas would very much like to leave behind. And I loved that, through Ettas perspective and that of the man himself, were able to catch a glimpse of what it was like back then and how it affected people of all races and status. And we see just how much humanity has changed though it is not truly equal for everyone even in this age, especially for women and minorities, which the author also talks about. One of my favorite parts of this book was also the history! Like I said above, I LOVE history. I love reading stories set in the past, which is hilarious since I dont read historical fiction. Like, ever. I think Im just very picky when it comes to them. I like historical books that dont make me feel like Im slogging through the story, like I cant understand anything if I havent researched the time period. The author certainly piles on the details, but in such a way that it flows with the story. That it just adds another layer to an already richly developed book. And the two POVs were DISTINCT. They were different; they felt like a 21st century woman and a pirate from 1776. It was never hard to distinguish where they were at and who was speaking. I also loved that it was told in 3rd person and that I could still connect with both characters. I think maybe my only gripe gripe is a strong word, more like a minor eh, it could have been better but I dont really care anyway because I loved the book too much with this was the secondary characters. There were many; ones that helped the characters and others that were set out to destroy them. Most of them had developed relationships with the MCs, though we didnt see them much throughout the story. Like Ettas mom, who is wonderful and clearly protective of her daughter. They had a great relationship, but when Etta timetravels we lose that, though her mom is always at the back of her mind through everything. I loved Chase and Captain Hall too, and I wish wed gotten more of those two. I also would love the Ironwoods to play a heavier role in Wayfarer. I feel like the surface was barely scratched with them. Im almost mad at myself for reading this so early, since Im dying after that cliffhanger. But the pain was totally worth it ask me this again in a few months, and Ill probably tell you to shut up. Passenger was just a beautifully written book that cleverly interweaves the past and present, with characters that come from two completely different times but who find in each other a common ground and a place to belong, and a story that takes the readers on a whirlwind of an adventure. Rating: 4.5 Paw Prints!
This review was originally posted on BlookGirl.com.  Where do I begin? I loved this story. Truly, madly, deeply loved. Because this story is entirely new, its hard to go into details without spoilers. However, I will do my best to articulate why and how this reimagining caught my attention, reined me in, and held me captive from beginning to end. Ive read the original Peter Pan, by J.M. Barrie, and Ive also seen the various movies that came afterward, the most popular being the Disney version, which Ive watched about a zillion times. I know the story inside and out and have long since held certain characters as my favorites. However, reading Tiger Lily has inspired me to see the characters in a whole different light and to reconsider my loyalties. Tiger Lily, more than anything, is a comingofage story. To be clear, it is a prequel of sorts that focuses not on Peter Pan or on the Darling children, but on the enigmatic Tiger Lily. Her story is narrated by my favorite faerie, Tinker Bell, which I thought was a genius move. This is not the carefree, lighthearted tale we all know. Instead, it is heartbreaking and melancholy, yet utterly bewitching. Tink said it best: Let me tell you something straight off. This is a love story, but not like any youve ever heard. The boy and the girl are far from innocent. Dear lives are lost. And good doesnt win. Neverland is dark and bleak, full of monstrous pirates, murderous mermaids, ferocious forest monsters, and a mischevious group of motherless boys led by the mysterious Peter Pan. Tiger Lily is the orphaned adoptee of the village shaman, Tik Tok, and Tinker Bell is her constant, yet largely unacknowledged companion. Tiger Lilys character really won my heart. Shes stubborn, prideful, and a bit conceited, but shes also courageous, caring, and loyal. She marches to the beat of her own drum, but is also resigned to the expectations of her village. Then, two important things happen to her: first, she rescues a man whose ship was wrecked off the coast of Neverland; then, she meets Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. Despite being unrelated, these two happenings later converge to change the course of her life forever. Im not myself, she offered, guiltily. She softened around Tik Tok, and when she did she was, for those rare moments, girlish. He smiled. You can never say that. Youre just a piece of yourself right now that you dont like. Peters character in Tiger Lily was a refreshing change of pace from his other personifications. Hes wild yet refined, cold yet loving, confident yet insecure. He wants so badly to be good, but hes still a boy, and therefore unpredictable and stubborn. The Lost Boys look up to him and he loves them in his own, clumsy way. It was breathtaking to see Peter through Tinks eyes. It was clear that she loved him dearly. How can I describe Peters face, the pieces of him that stick to my heart? Peter sometimes looked aloof and distant; sometimes his face was open and soft as a bruise. Sometimes he looked completely at Tiger Lily, as if she were the point on which all the universe revolved, as if she were the biggest mystery of life, or as if she were a flame and he couldnt not look even though he was scared. And sometimes it would all disappear into carelessness, confidence, amusement, as if he didnt need anyone or anything on this earth to feel happy and alive. The relationship that develops between Tiger Lily and Peter is tentative and sweet and real. They appear to be opposites, with Tiger Lily being distrustful and quiet and Peter being so open and full of life; however, they are more alike than they seem. Neither of them fit societys idea of a good boy or a good girl, and while they both have good intentions, they do make some pretty big mistakes. Overall, though, theirs is a believeable first love story and I cheered them on with my whole heart. You may be asking, Wheres Captain Hook? Mr. Smee? They were there, too, in their resplendent, drunken glory. I always secretly loved Mr. Smee, but I felt sorry for Captain Hook. We do learn a bit more about Captain Hook in Tiger Lily, and while hes still a villain, its clear that he was not always a bad guy, and is not the only danger Peter and Tiger Lily have to worry about. It didnt fit her ideas of who was bad, and who was good, and what was a happy ending, and what wasnt. I experienced a gamut of emotions while reading this book. There are very heavy subjects addressed throughout, including death, sexual orientation, religion, abuse, and selfacceptance. I know it may seem a bit odd that these subjects would be in a YA novel, but I thought they were appropriate within the story arc, and incredibly thoughtprovoking. I had to set the book down a few times to really absorb what I had just read, which I believe indicates a truly great book. There is no happilyeverafter for all of the characters in Tiger Lily, but thats what makes the story so precious and heartwrenching. The last two pages made me cry like a baby. Tinker Bell was certainly the best narrator for this story. Because she loved both Peter and Tiger Lily, I feel that we, as readers, get to see the very best and the very worst of them  which will only make you love and appreciate them more. Raw, emotional, and unpredictable, Tiger Lily is not for everyone, and I cant definitively say that you will love it. I do think this is a story that, regardless of how you feel about it, will stick with you for a long time. It has moved up in the ranks as one of my alltime favorite books, and I cant see that ever changing.
Sophronia isnt exactly like other girls her age. Rather then sitting prettily in a chair and waiting to be wooed, shed rather be climbing up a tree. Her mother therefore has decided she needs to go to finishing school... yet the finishing school that takes her isnt what it seems. While they will make a lady out of her, they arent interested in quelling her unusual habits, but in cultivating them for a more open ended meaning of finishing. A school devoted to the arts of espionage will obviously have a few evil villains and traitors in the mix. Sophronia and her posse of friends soon stumble on a plot to leak information for an astonishing new invention to the evil Picklemen, who have already attacked the school once. It is up to them to stop this from happening, this is what they are being schooled in after all... I wanted to like this book, I really really did. Thankfully, now that more reviews are coming out it seems to be just me, which I hoped was the case, because I love Gails writing but I just didnt love this. While reading this book I did something I rarely ever do, and thats set the book aside for awhile. Usually when a book isnt working for me I try to push on through till I reach a point where either I grudgingly find something to like and my opinion is changed or I finish it and can mark it off my list and get it out of my life and onto the next book. But I love Gail so much I thought that everything I was hating about the book was just in my head. So I set it aside and read something else, which I really enjoyed. Feeling hopeful that my joy in books was undiminished, I picked up Etiquette and Espionage again and found that I still could barely stand reading it. The book was indeed a book I had to push through till the end and then I had a hard talking to with myself as to the rating Id give it... lets put it this way, it was saved from the one star rating just because of Bumbersnoot. Who doesnt love a Steampunk version of K9 without all the annoying mistress stuff? Dumbing down. That is the flaw that got in my craw. There is nothing I hate more then feeling like an author is talking down to me, which is a fatal flaw of L. Frank Baum, or dumbing down their writing so that little old me can understand it. Oh gosh, I just cant handle the overly big words, it makes my brain hurt. I have noticed that several authors who have written for a predominately adult audience arent quite able to make this shift into YA. For some reason they treat their audience differently and change their writing stylistically. The thing is, the YA market is a very discerning audience. Gails previous books have much cross genre appeal and she could have easily just taken out the sexy bits of her previous books and that would have been enough. But instead we get a book that is predominately action which lacked a snap to the language, and it felt flat. The witty repartee seemed pushed aside for plot expedience, making the whole book lackluster. Etiquette and Espionage felt like a wonderful book that had been mercilessly bowdlerized to make it into a blockbuster that was dumbed down for the masses. Gone is the chatter over tea and scones, in is the heroine climbing the side of a dirigible... why? Because obviously thats the easiest way to get to the bowels of the ship? Excuse me what? Action action action to me is dull, please bring back the chats over tea. Yet it wasnt just the writing that was dull, but the plot and characters. For a heroine, Sophronia was very one dimensional. She was good at physical activities such as climbing... yeah, thats it for Sophronia. Oh, except that she is so obtuse! I mean, its understandable that at first she didnt get the joke and the true meaning behind a finishing school but that she continuously didnt get it just drove me insane. I just wanted anyone at all to pull her aside and go, Ok, so, Sophronia, we know that in your world getting finished means getting all your accomplishments polished so that you can be married off, but look at the classes we teach here, finishing can also mean killing someone, ok, now stop being so dumb. Add additional characters even dumber than her as sidekicks and a very basic espionage plot, and the book just didnt appeal to me at all. Sorry. Though there is one aspect of the book that bothered me beyond all the dumbing down and that is Soap. Soap himself doesnt bother me as such, in that hes just a stock minority character to round out Sophronias team, its his name. In another instance of Sophronias stupidity, upon first meeting Soap she doesnt realize that he is black because he is covered in soot from coal. His name comes from the fact that no matter how much he washes, hell still look like hes covered in soot. Excuse me? Um... this name offends me on so many levels. I dont care if its irony or self parody on Soaps part, to me its racist. While the name is countered by his portrayal and the fact that he is a love interest, the name is just so so wrong. Even before this time in England, there where quite wealthy and well respected blacks in the community, thank you Regency House Party. Slavery was first abolished in 1807 with any people slow to the party being taken out with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, while this book is set in 1851. So, while I know racism even lingers to this day, there was so much upheaval and change and so much good being done before the setting of this book that by naming the character Soap, it just feels like two steps backwards. So, wow, this is turned into a rather wordy review now didnt it? I guess I just really needed to justify those two stars which have been worrying rather a fair few of my friends who are also huge fans of Gail Carriger. In summation, I dont think this book will get Gail many new readers. There is just too much world building that is dependent on having read the previous books, written for a much older audience who will not appreciate the dumbing down of the writing. The only little joy I got from this book, aside from Bumbersnoot, was seeing characters from The Parasol Protectorate at a younger age... though not all cameos are successful. Yet there are ways this series could work. I liked the school and the fixed environment, just flesh it out more, set aside more chapters to fully explore this school. Show us classes. Make it Harry Potter on a damn dirigible not debutantes climbing dirigibles! And please, before anything else, give Soap a real name.
THIS BOOK IS PSYCHOTIC!!! I MEAN IT IS INHUMANLY GOOD. I had finished this book at 8:35 pm after staying up most of the night to read a good chunk of it and falling asleep at 9 am. I really dont know where to begin. I think the characters are the soul of this book and I will talk about them individually but I do want to answer whether it is important to have read the Grisha trilogy or not before this book. The answer is no. However because I did read the trilogy before, I was able to recognize some of the people mentioned from that series and I felt that I had more empathy about the plight of the Grisha especially knowing what happened to Ravka in that trilogy. I also wanted to mention that I listened to this book up to chapter 27 in audiobook form only because I was away from home therefore I was without the actual book and I needed to read it for my buddy read. Once I returned home I did read the book from the beginning again but I wanted to say that the voice acting for all of the characters was amazing. Especially Matthias and Kazs voice actors. BRAVO, GENTLEMEN, BRAVO. They are so good that I am going to listen to the end of this book once more time even though Ive just finished the physical book. Alright onto the stars of the show in order of favourites: 6. Wylan His character was the only one I didnt connect to very much and I think this is because we didnt have any chapters from his point of view. I basically knew him from other peoples perception of him aka. Jesper mostly and so I feel like he comes across as a sidekick instead of a hero. I did find it nice to have some of his naivete in amongst this den of vipers and thieves. It was refreshing. He is also the only character that I felt acted the age that he was in this whole book. I believed he was a teenager caught up in something way over his head and that at least made me care for his well being. 5. JesperOkay our first flawed character but the funniest. I was always laughing out loud whenever Jesper was on the scene. He is that comic relief that is definitely needed in this group but I love that he is able to get serious sometimes. I liked that as his chapters go on there is more introspection about what he is doing with his life and who he is. Sometimes his sections read like a YA contemporary expect with side commentary about shooting and killing people. I love Jesper. 4. InejShe is a big player in the underworld of the Barrel. All of her chapters had a lot of observations about many characters but mostly Kaz. She did do some self reflection near the end which I appreciated and she started to feel less like a machine to me at that point. She is also referred to as The Wraith and in her beginning chapters, I felt that was a perfect description of her. She was there in her chapters but not really. Like a breeze passing through a room or a fly on the wall which matched her skill set of spy in the book. I also loved that her body was a living weapon and listening to her talk her body through some of the most crazy stunts in this book was awe inspiring. To watch Inej pull off half the shit she does in this book alone warrants making this book into a movie. 3. Nina Now I am the first to admit that I did not like Nina in the beginning. She seemed pretty forgettable but she quickly grew on me and the more I learned about her the more I rooted for her. I love that she is so loyal to this crew but even more I love her loyalty to Ravka. This ties in with my point about reading the Grisha trilogy. Nina is a byproduct of that civil war and her actions stem from the fact that Ravka is unstable. Her patriotism to her country warms me. It fills me with happiness knowing that after all that Alina suffered through; after all the lives that she had saved, there are still those working tirelessly to make Ravka safe and strong. I also loved how unapologetic Nina is and how in the end she is the knight in shining armour. A true hero and solider. This girl is a BAWSE!!! 2. Matthias Oh man this dude is so badass. Chapter 7 is when we meet Matthias for the first time and what an impression this guy makes. Ive read that part twice in the physical book and twice on audio. I love the voice actor for Matthias. His voice is low, sexy and DANGEROUS!!  fans myself  Anyways what I love about Matthias is that he is the tortured solider. In love with his enemy and traitor to his country, Matthias chapters are all beautiful and scary inner thoughts and reflections that are well written and thought provoking. His heart wrenching description of Nina at the beginning of chapter 7 was GORGEOUS and CRAZY. I got the same feels there that I got reading Shatter Me. Listening to Juliettes mental instability gave me goose bumps and that exactly how I felt about Matthias diatribe. Matthias growth in dealing with his new circumstances were my favourite chapters and of course I loved how he eventually starts to talk about Nina. His struggle between right and wrong, duty and honour, friend or foe was always captured so perfectly. It was interesting because he represented the threat that all Grisha must face in this new world that Alina saved. His prejudices were incredibly powerful and very much reminded me of actual slavers in this world. I did mention at one point in my status updates that I was reminded of the accounts of slavery I read in Yaa Gyasis Homegoing. Again no disrespect in the comparison but I was shocked how Leigh managed to convey the real brutality of this kind of thinking in a book aimed at young adults. I loved Matthias. I cant wait to see him grow further. AND OF OF COURSE LAST BUT NOT LEAST......... 1. Kaz WTF Brekker   Shakes my damn head  Im actually speechless. Every time this dude steps out on the block, its a goddamn performance. Incredible. I dont know where Leigh had to go to get inspiration for this character but I dont think anyone could visit it especially at night. When we meet Kaz in chapter 2, I immediately thought I was in some kind of movie like Casino 1995. Honestly Im at a loss for words...... okay let me try using adjectives to describe him. Smart, Mysterious, Dangerous, Corrupt, Ruthless, Leader.................LEGEND. You can pick any chapter that belongs to Kaz and your in for something crazy. Its is solely after reading chapter 2 that I did not believe that any of them, but specifically Kaz , were teenagers. Kaz acts like a 25 year old man. His back story is probably something the bogeyman likes to hear before bed. It is incredible grotesque and dark. The things that he has done. The things that he did. Oh man......they DO NOT call him Dirtyhands for no reason. This book was great just based off the group and the heist but IT IS LEGENDARY because of Brekker. Enough said. This whole book was amazing however my only gripe is that the characters were not older. I kept Wylan the same age but everyone else I had to age up in my head otherwise it was just not believable enough. I had Inej at 21, Nina at 25, Jesper at 26, Kaz at 25 and Matthias at 27. I dont think it would have hurt the story to have an older cast at all. I literally cant wait to start Crooked Kingdom and I truly feel sympathy for all of you who had to actually wait the year till it came out in order to find out what happens. I would have been in a world of hurt if I had to wait.  Still shaking my head What an epic read. Speechless
4 Full of Mischief STARS Her grandmother had told her to beware the wolves that prowled in the wood, but the little girl knew the little boy was not dangerous, even if he was the king of goblins. It has taken me like 2 weeks to actually get around posting this review, but well, here its at last. For what Ive seen, this is either a hit or miss, and since I read this one had Caraval vibes, I thought this one would be fun. But just as a spoiler, this has like 1 Caraval vibe related to the sister so I wouldnt even say this too are similar at all. Both good, but nothing alike. Elizabeth Liesl is an eighteen year old who grew up listening to stories of what hides in the woods of Bavaria and the Goblin King. She may have believed that once, but growing up was a hardship that stole that piece of her, along with the dream to become a composer. Now, she is worried about helping in her family inn and make money to help meet month ends. Suddenly, a series of events will unravel and force Liesl to play games with the Lord of Mischief himself, to try to bring her sister Kathe back home from the Underground where she was taken. And with this, Liesl will learn that promising something to the Goblin King, is not a childs game. Her words stopped me short. What are you talking about? I asked. What game? You tell me. Constanzes expression was grave. The wishes we make in the dark have consequences, and the Lord of Mischief will call their reckoning. This story is set in Bavaria, in a small town where superstitions run deep and the woods are always hiding something. And thats an important fact you should have fresh in your mind about this book, in my opinion. This is set around a late 18th  early 19th century, so theres a really traditional mindset of small towns and patriarchal society. Women do most of the work, as you see Liesl mom take care of running the inn when the dad is always said to be in company of a bottle. I love the fact that the society norms or expectations were implied but never told, because if we were part of that story, thats how it would have been. Women dont have the chance of pursuing bigger dreams, and thats why Liesl is always in conflict about being recognized as a great composer and the fact that, thats never gonna happen. She is also the responsible child, so she never rebels to this status quo, just accepts its as everyone else. Thats also why people are so judgmental about women in general, or another reason why Liesl has those envy thoughts about Kathe, because she embraces her sensuality in ways that are not fully accepted at the time, and thats something she wants to, to break free from the expectations. All this framework helps understand why Liesl is so pasive sometimes and even though I hated how things were for her, it made sense about the decisions she took. The power of a wish. In the world above, wishes were willothewisps: beautiful, but insubstantial and always out of reach. Here in the Underground, willothewisps were very much real. Tricksy little creatures: sly, deceitful, but tangible. Touchable. My wished had weight. The writing was devastatingly beautiful. It was deeply poetic, somewhat dark and nostalgic, like when you remember a dream but you are not sure if it was good or bad, and youre left with a feeling something magical happened. Fascinating, that would be the word at the end to describe it. The author not only crafted the story perfectly and made the worldsetting real, but the writing made it seem so surreal and beliavable, and it is almost the whole reason this book is 4 stars. There is music in your soul. A wild and untamed sort of music that speaks to me. It defies all the rules and laws you humans set upon it. It grows from inside you, and I have a wish to set that music free. Liesl was an okay character for me. I felt bad about the reality she faced, with not being able to pursue her music, living behind Kathes beauty or Josefs talent; like it was a rule of the universe that she was always deserving of the leftovers. There were times I liked her, others I just didnt understand her actions. I actually didnt care for most of the characters, but I wanted to know how this story would developed. I enjoyed how well was shown her fears of going crazy or her forgetting issues, not only the beautiful writing makes it even more real, but it feels like as a reader youd went through them as if you were the one forgetting. And that, he said, is the ugly truth, my dear. I could have your hand in marriage, your mind, your body, but what I truly want, I cannot have. He turned his head away. Not unless I break you. Now, the Goblin King, Lord of Mischief. I have always loved a mysterious character that makes me suspicious, and this one was just like that. He played the game by his rules, ones that will always lead him to win, and even though he has feelings for Liesl, he doesnt make it easy for her. I liked that because it made the whole book more complex given the consequences this would bring. Therere a lot of different facets of the Goblin King, and it was interesting how the author developed each side without making it hard for the reader to understand him as a whole character as well. The Goblin King was none of the things I knew him to be. He was the Lord of Mischiefmercurial, melancholy, seductive, beautifulbut he was, above all, dangerous. It took me time to get into the story, I spent a day trying to finish chapter 1 because I just wasnt interested, though I could blame the late reading slump vibes for that. The thing that I disliked the most about reading this book was how long it took me to read it. I struggled to read it even when I really wanted to know what the story was going to bring next, although I didnt care for any character, but at the same time I could see myself not being really invested in this book. I know you may think that Im the one to blame if I take too long to read a book, but I only get stuck when I dont like the story or I have a super busy week, and even then I actually could make it work. But with this one, I had free time and still I struggled to move on with it. This was actually going to be a 33,5 read for me, but at the end I was left with so much love for the writing I actually want to know what happens in the next book!, that I decided to rate it with 4 stars. Of all my mortal emotions, hope was the worst. All the others were easy to carry and easy to put aside: anger flashed then burned out, sorrow gradually lightened, and happiness bubbled then disappeared. But hope...hope was stubborn. Like a weed it returned, even after I had plucked it away again and again. Hope also hurt. Overall this book is a magical experience. I may not have enjoyed it as much as I actually wanted to, but I cant praise enough about how beautiful the writing was and the intriguing storyline. I would recommend this one if youre looking for a story to sweep you away with its poetic and haunting writing plus mysterious plot, Im definitely not forgetting this one in long time.
Whatever youre reading, stop. Set it aside and go find the nearest copy of A Court of Thorns and Roses. Im not kidding, this book is life changing. It left me in ruins, left me breathless and clutching bedsheets, and the end result was a sobbing mess around three in the morning with no one but the authors Pinterest boards to get me through it. I was as unburdened as a piece of dandelion fluff, and he was the wind that stirred me about the world. Feyre, a nineteen year old huntress living in shambles, is the reason her family is still alive. She keeps them fed, if not for her own reasons than for the vow she made to her dying mother years ago. While hunting one snowy dawn, she encounters a beast of sheer size and stealth, stalking the meager prey she had been scourging for. Hesitating only briefly, Feyre slayed the wolf before it could spot her. Days later, a feral creature breaks down the door of her cottage and demands retribution for his murdered friend. Not willing to die cowering, nor to see her family in harms way, Feyre agrees to the beasts proposal. She must return with him over the border to where the faerie realm lies, and live in his house for the rest of her life. Feyre discovers her captor isnt just an animal, but a lethal faerie lord who reigns over one of the crumbling courts. Faced with a war that, if lost, could breach the borders to the mortal world, Feyre comes to find that she has a grander role in this game of bloodshed far more pressing than anything shed imagined. From the first page I could tell this was going to be a masterpiece. The descriptions Maas uses to unravel the world of Prythian are...thrilling. Everything from the details of the faerie courts to the color scheme of Feyres artistic eye was so well crafted. There was never a dull moment. Ever. I finished the book in two days timetwo school days. You can imagine the haggard dark circles under my eyes and shaking hands full of coffee mugs. It was so worth it. Feyre is such a kick ass heroine. She always held herself upright and didnt give a shit about the obscure social structures set within her world and Tamlins. She obeyed Tamlin but only when she saw fit, making her one of my favorite fictional characters. And let me tell you, on the occasion that she finds herself disobeying him...well, the phrase I dont bite isnt exactly appropriate for that context. Her sass combined with Luciens was honestly some of the best dialogue I had ever read. Lucien in general was such an enrapturing character, right down to his fiery hair and fox mask. His background story was as heartbreaking as it was morbid, and Im glad he and Tamlin met because they arguably have the strongest friendship in this series thus far. In fact, after Feyre joined the boys I could see a new golden trio blossoming pun very much intended. Luciens sarcastic remarks combined with Tamlins glaringly awful attempts to flirt made for an even more hysterical adventure. Between the two of those boys and Feyre trying to remain indifferent, I was cracking up every time Lucien attempted to subtly coach Tamlin in the art of courtship. The trios banter was amazing. Midway through the book is when we really started to see Tamlin falling in love with Feyre and vice versa. Between his polite but sometimes feral demeanor and her determined but occasionally dejected expressions, their love turned into something of a fire. It burned everything in its path and swallowed up all other matters, consuming the rest of the world in mirthful flames. And I dont just mean the notorious Calanmai aka Fire Night, either. I wont even get into that. Feyre presents him with one of her paintings as a gift, but after viewing the rest of her artworka rather grim retelling of her lifes burdenshe decides he wants the painting he configures with most, the same one that, although seemingly plain, frayed open her heart from memories of hunting for survival between the inky trees. This the painting reminds me of it. Of what? I breathed. He lowered the painting, looking right at me, right into me. That Im not alone. Im 15000 proud to say those two are my new OTP One True Pairing. The moment that solidified that was during the Summer Solstice celebration when Feyre, to Luciens great dismay, got her hands on a little too much faerie wine and danced all night long to Tamlins fiddling. So. Freaking. Cute. My heart exploded, then was reborn with a whole new innuendo during the scenes that followed the event. Aannndd aside from my new OTP, Lucien is my new favorite sass master. Seriously, every time something awkward would happen he either resorted to more teasing or found the nearest exit. Or got drunk. Still, one of my favorite scenes of his was when he tried to diffuse Tamlin and Feyres eye sex. Are you sure? he murmured, intent and hungry enough that I was glad I was sitting. He could have had me right there, on top of that table. I wanted his broad hands running over my bare skin, wanted his teeth scraping against my neck, wanted his mouth all over me. Im trying to eat, Lucien said, and I blinked, the air whooshing out of me. But now that I have your attention, Tamlin, he snapped, though the High Lord was looking at me againdevouring me with his eyes. I could hardly stand the clothes scratching my toohot skin. With some effort, Tamlin glanced back at his emissary. Maas has created the best retelling of a story, hands down. Beauty and the Beast has got nothing on A Court of Thorns and Roses. The masks bit was ingenious, and the plots, more twisted than hidden pathways, kept me guessing all night. The antagonists in this story were truly frightening. Between the Attor, a creature of deceit and shadows, and Queen Amarantha of Prthian, I anticipated a hair raising finale. And Maas didnt disappoint. The three trials commencing the book were so brutal and cynical, and I honestly had sweaty palms and a racing heartbeat while devouring the pages. Amarantha and her court were frightening in a childlike manor, deceiving and compelling those around them, literally chaining people to her court Under the Mountain. I wanted to rip her throat out just as much as Feyre, especially when we are introduced to Rhysand. The ending of the book filled me with such great euphoria that I remained prone in my bedroom and stared like an idiot at my ceiling, pondering life and why its so hard to find a faerie lord to take as my own. Im glad there wasnt any impending cliffhangers, however we are left with a few pressing issuesFeyres promise to Rhysand being the most prominent one at the moment. And after the way those two departed, Im curious as to what he saw on her face? I wont go into my theories in fear of giving away spoilers to those of you who havent read the book just yet...but damn. Way to leave me bristling. Overall, this book was such a treat and I feel as though I have a personal connection to it. Everyone must go read it and then retreat back here to bemoan our love for the characters. The anticipation I have for the sequel might even be enough to kill me. 65 starswould even recommend it to my enemy.
I am floored. FLOORED!!! I honestly dont know where to begin! This is one of the most compelling stories I have ever read! I cant even decide what gripped me more, the plot, the theories, or the characters! Ill try to separate my review into three sections: The Characters: Neve Knightly 1st protagonist: She is studying neuroscience, but hates it and her professor hates her, which is hilarious!, but she is pushing through because she doesnt really know what she wants out of life she kind of want to be an artist. She is still recovering from losing the love of her life Dylan a few years back he disappeared without a trace. So when he suddenly comes back, things get real intense, real fast! But what I loved was how their relationship was so unique. You can sense how strong their bond was and still is, even though technically it was ripped apart when he vanished. I love how she deals with his return. You can tell she is uncertain about the right thing to do, so she lets both her mind and heart lead the way. She doesnt do stupid things bc of love, and she doesnt become an annoying little girl by shutting him out in order to protect her broken heart or something lame. She is very intelligent, but also honest about being lost in life. She is trying to find her purpose, and when something tragic happens god... I cant even talk about it..., she starts to realize that the signs have always been there. That shed been ignoring them, and now is finally the time to face her demons head on and man does she ever! pun intended LOL!. One of the best female protagonists I have EVER read! She is strongwilled, but also very kind. Smart, sexy, sweet, but also very human. Her actions and reactions are all reasonable. She not once did something stupid that would make me want to drop the book, and I dont have a tolerance for forced behavior just to drive the story forward. Dylan Sterling 2nd protagonist and Neves ex: He is FASCINATING! Probably my favorite, though his best friend Romer is also a very strong contender! So as I said, he vanished 3 years ago, and been completely out of touch with Neve or anyone else. But the reason isnt what you might think! The need to know the truth was so strong I kept on flipping the pages, waiting for sections from his point of view! And it did not disappoint! All of my questions were answered like a trail of delicious little bread crumbs, and then a feast at the end OH THE ENDING!! There is an even bigger question raised that makes me want to scream in joy and madness because I have no idea when the next book is coming out!!! Romer Antony 3rd protagonist and Dylans exbest friend: He is solid too, and Dylans disappearance hugely affected him, even more than Neve. BROMANCE ALERT! And I loved every single scene he was in! His flashbacks are IN.TENSE! He is actually pretty hilarious, but really damaged. The author gave him just enough sexappeal to be the bad boy, and even though hes got all the right ingredients, he is just SO much more than that. The backstory for all 3 characters is SO RICH that you cant just think of Romer as a romantic complication. Actually, although there are 3 lead characters, its kind of not a lovetriangle. But it kind of is... You almost feel like the bond broken bond between Dylan and Romer is much stronger. Too strong for Neve to come between them, and the author shows that really well! The awkwardness is so real, and so wonderful to read! Marcus Holt Neves prof: hes not one of the leads, but I love him, the guy is a douchebag! I keep imagining Michael C. Hall playing him for some reason lololol keep picturing him from Kill Your Darlings! But I just love how he doesnt apologize for all the blunt, horrible things he says. And you kind of cant blame him cause theyre true! The Theories: Brilliant. BRILLIANT! I cant stress this enough! Have you ever watched an action movie, or a super hero movie and thought: ok, sure, lets believe its possible to have super powers because a spider bit you, or because youre an alien, or because youre cursed, or whatever... just so you can actually watch the movie and not call B.S. on everything??? Ok, well this book addresses all the things other moviesstories skip! It actually FULLY EXPLAINS supernatural abilities! I have never ever thought this was possible, but after a section in the book where things are explained, I actually had to put the book down and think about what Ive just read. I was FLOORED. For a moment, I actually wondered if there could be some truth to these theories!!!??? What if its not just fiction? I started to think back to my own memories, dreams, and was all: HOLY SH! I cant say what the theories are, but they make so much sense! They are so intricate and wellexplained. Ive seen less worldbuilding in some fantasy books. This story is placed in current times, but the system of the theories was so rich, I feel like I could actually believe them. The PLOT! Page turner! Fastpaced as hell, and the action scenes are so cinematic! The way things were described, I wouldnt just see them like Im watching a movie though, it was like its happening to me! I think the author used the points of view so creatively! It was unlike anything else Ive read. The events that happened were so clever and unique, and I cant get the pictures out of my head. There was definitely a bit of violence, but no sexuality besides romantic kissing, but it was intense. The tension starts out right away between both Neve and Dylan, and Neve and Romer, and it keeps on getting more and more overbreaing, and you just have NO IDEA which pairing to root for! I think Im Team Dromer, cause I honestly love their friendship. Its destroyed by what happened three years ago, but its on the mend, and its so beautiful to watch. Also, the WRITING! This is apparently a debut novel, but I didnt believe it. So I read the biography of the author and apparently she ACTUALLY studied NEUROSCIENCE! So that didnt surprise me so much then. She is an amazing storyteller, and I cannot wait for the next books! I feel so honoured to have been asked to review this book. Although I already have the ARC she emailed it to me in exchange for an honest review, I cant wait to buy a physical copy. And the cover is STUNNING!!
Check out this review at Such a Novel Idea! I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. This is one of those books that Ive wanted to read since the moment I saw its cover, way before it was even a book on a shelf. And yet, here I still sat well, when I signed up for this tour at least, a person who had yet to read the awesomeness. So, YAY for a paperback release tour, because dang was that book something I needed in my life. First of all, I need to talk about the audiobook. I started the audiobook once upon a time, never reading the book and couldnt keep up with the story. SO, when I started reading for this review, I was reading the print version of the paperback that is being released. And man, it is GORGEOUS. The book itself is a freaking work of art and I cannot even imagine how many hours went into making it look that way. But, as I got into the story, I got desperate. You see, I would have to stop reading and come to this thing called work and the only books I am allowed to read during work hours are audiobooks. So, I gave it another try. And boy am I glad it did. The production value of this audiobook is one of the highest Ive ever seen. The voice actors were phenomenal and at times I felt more like I was listening to an old school radio program, because this was almost like a dramatized version of the book. Almost as in basically was just probably isnt labeled that way. There were freaking commercials and special sounds and music and voice actors ACTING out certain parts of the book My favorite part had to be a drunk message from Ezra to Kady. Classic. I honestly dont know which version I liked better, the print or the audio. So, Illuminae is straight up science fiction, but there is SO MUCH happening in the way the story is told. Youre getting it through files, instant messages, emails deleted, sent, drafts, etc., blacked out securitygovermentesque reports, pictures, etc. So, if you think a 600 page book is daunting, remember, its not gonna be near as many words as you think. Which, becomes bad when you want MORE of the story. Good thing book two is already out! And what could come off as kitchy if not done with the proper finesse, is just a freakin work of art. Seriously. I feel like Ill spend just as much talking about the way the book was made as I will the actual plot of the book. Because, its just that good. The only way this book could actually PULL OFF all this quirky formatting and not be a gimmick is if the characters and story itself were good. And they were damn good. The story revolves around two teens, Kady and Ezra, who break up the morning of an invasion on their planet. They both survive and are sent to different ships. But of course, they still are in love and its still way awkward. Kady becomes an underground hacker and Ezra gets conscripted. They are both hilarious with razorsharp wit and sarcasm to boot. And its hard not to like them both almost immediately. Kady was SMART and not just off the charts brilliant, but smart and rational for a teenager. She asked questions, thought through decisions, and didnt just leap off into a void unknowingly if she could help it. She is a character that quickly became a favorite for me. Ezra was funny and relatable and totally in love with Kady. And their romance was super fun, because it wasnt conventional. They werent together  quite literally on different ships  and yet, you could still see how much they meant to one another. I would be remiss if I didnt talk about the third main character, AIDAN. Yes, AIDAN is AI, specifically the AI that is supposed to be protecting the fleet. And while some would say it is just a computer, I say IT IS SO MUCH MORE. AIDAN brings its own life to the story in a hilarious and psychotic way and while I cant say more, I will say I kinda totally 100 dug it. This book will mess with your head. These authors arent afraid to make the big plot twists that leave you audibly gasping. Its definitely a wild ride youre about to go on when you start the book. It starts out slow, but when you finally look up, you realize theres no way you can put it down and stop until youve finished. I know this book isnt going to be for everyone. Like I said, its straight up scifi, but I think if people can put that aside, they will see it is totally worth testing the waters of this genre for. And the formatting is going to straight up piss some people off. For those people, I say listen to the audiobook. Youll hear a drama rather than seeing a bunch of crazy pages and it might make it better. But really, I cannot recommend this book enough. It stands on its own as a really rad, fun, wild read. Since the moment I picked up These Broken Stars when it was a galley, Ive been a fan of Amie Kaufman. I didnt know how well shed collaborate with another author outside that series, but obviously she has the gift, because her and Jay Kristoff are book writing magicians together.
I have been seeing this book everywhere for the past year and I dont know why I did not grab a copy of it earlier. After being on a contemporary binge, I decided I want to try another fantasy book and dive into a new world. And so I got myself an ebook of this so that I can finally learn what all the hype is about. And boy, I am going to buy the whole series the next time I go to a bookstore. It even has a map! The story is set in Ravkaa country loosely reminiscent of Russia, a land haunted by threats caused by surrounding enemies. It was once a great nation, but now divided into two by the Shadow Fold. The Shadow Fold in as vast stretch of darkness, created by the Black Heretic centuries ago, that separated the rest of the country from the True Sea where most of their resources are found. The Shadow Fold is infested with Volcras, monstrous flesheating creatures that would devour anyone who tries to cross the Fold. A lot of people from Ravka would dare to make the trip because of their need to survive. Most of them are with aid of the Grisha. The Grisha is an elite group of people with special abilities called Small Science. It is not exactly magic, but a power to manipulate certain elements such as fire, wind, metal, blood, etc. They are very reminiscent of the airbenders, waterbenders, firebenders, and earthbenders from Avatar, but I think they can control much more specific elements. These people are born with this power and are expected to hone them as they grow up. The most powerful of them is the Darkling. He is living amplifier and can manipulate the darkness. He has the power that everyone fears for he can kill people with just a flick of the hand. And so he is considered as their leader, the man they feared. The story is about Alina Starkov, an orphan and now a mapmaker for the military. Together with her bestfriend, Mal, the army is to cross the Shadow Fold to get to the other side of the country. When things took an unfortunate turn and they were attacked by the Volcra, Mal got brutally injured which sparked a power deep within Alina that she didnt know she possessed. And this was the trigger that changed her life. Suddenly she was ripped from the life she had by the Darkling. He believes that Alina might be the solution to end the long war and the savior of their people. She was thrown into the lavishing world of Grisha where she is trained and cultivated. But then the seamingly beautiful world has its own dark secrets. And it is up to Alina to find her way and learn the truth of it all.  From the very first chapter, I was already enchanted by this book. Leigh Bardugo was able to create such a wonderful world rich with beauty and magic that would certainly get you hooked. Though the story was not at all oneofakind, it was still a breath of fresh air to read about another place. Though it was clear that Ravka is fiction, it was still loosely based on Russias culture. I love reading something set in different place other than America and Leigh Bardugo just gave me that. Unlike in other fantasy books, she did not bombard readers with too much information all at once. The worldbuilding is gradual and each chapter leads you to more details of Ravka, its people, and the Grisha. My mind was reeling with images of the scenes I am reading, and all I could hope for was that the pictures my imagination conjures in my head would give justice to this beautiful world. I thoroughly enjoyed the intricately woven bits and peace of the Grisha world. The worldbuilding is phenomenal. I also loved the fact that it does not have cliched characters. In most books Ive read, we are presented with this protagonist who is already special and allpowerful in himselfherself. But in this book, we see a fairly mutlidimensional personality: snarky yet friendly, brave but not entirely fearless. We get to see Alinas development and how she slowly learned to master her abilities. It somehow reflects the reality that we, as people, need to work hard in other to be good at something. And I guess it is one thing that set this book apart from the others. The minor characters in the book also added to its appeal. A lot of them has so much to offer and they made the story much more interesting. These minor characters were not presented in a blackandwhite manner wherein one is on the good side, while the other is not. No. They were portrayed in a realistic way with a mix of good and bad traits, which made it so confusing whether they are trustworthy or not. And I think that it gives the story a much more depth and mystery. Another thing I particularly liked about this book is its take on beauty. The Grisha, aside from being extremely talented people, are also very much attractive. They wear rich and fine clothes and most people envy them. They also live their lives in luxury for they are considered royalty. But then as Alina was made to live like them, she soon realized that it was not glitz and glamour. Sometimes power, luxury, and fame is not enough to make you happy. I love that this topic was subtly included in the book because this is usually the problem in real life. Most of us dream of the perfect life but then when we get there, we soon face the reality that there are other things that would make us truly happy. Cliche as it sounds, happiness cannot be bought. There was only one thing I thought I would hate about this book and it is its love story. But even that did not disappoint. We all have, more or less, know about a book that has the typical scenario wherein the person falls in love with their best friend but the other doesnt feel the say way, right? And then there would be another person who would make that the 1st person forget about that rejection and they would live happily ever after. Its all too familiar, right? That was how I predicted the romance in this book would go about based on the given premise. It was clear from the summary of the book that there is going to be a love triangle between Mal, Alina, and the Darkling. I must admit, I cringed with that thought because I hate love triangles because they are so cliche. But oh boy, was I wrong. Alina and the Darklings relationship is something extremely sexy, adventurous, and unpredictable. It made me want to root for them when at first, I wanted Alina to be with Mal. And just when I thought I know how it would all play out, the author suddenly showed me something that would make me hate the Darkling and choose Mal again. Im just going to say that it was certainly not just a stupid predictable unnecessary love triangle. The love between the characters was believable and could really happen in real lifesomething that I was so thankful for in the story. I was so glad that the book did not disappoint. It lived up to the hype and the expectations I had of it. It was certainly something I would want to read again. It was actionpacked, fastpaced and never boring. With each chapter, I am given something to look forward to which would make me want to read faster. The element of suspense is there. The mystery and unfolding of secrets, the unpredictabilityall of these made for such a thrilling read, and I would definitely read the next books immediately. I will give the book 4.55 because I still need some more details of the Grisha world and I hope I find them in the other books.
Beloved Will, Reading this broke my heart. I am very sorry this happened. I have been very hostile towards you before but now I understand. I feel your pain and for that my heart aches that you are in this situation. I love Jem. But now I am confused. I hope things would turn out well. Will. You have a portion of my heart now. Please stay how you are now. Dont change back to who you are before. Yours truly, Sandee Merged review: The long wait is finally over. The long wait was worth it. Clockwork Prince did not disappoint! Ms. Clare continues to impress me with her flawless writing style and creativity. Clockwork Prince started where Clockwork Angel ended. Now, where to start? I usually give a brief summary of the book prior to me giving my review but Ill make an exception on this one. I dont want to give any spoilers though I think I still would be whether I like it or not. The Clockwork Prince was just so good I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs and tell everyone who havent read the book to read it. I am so truly, madly, deeply in love with the Infernal Devices series. COMMENTS ABOUT THE STORY: As I have mentioned earlier, Clockwork Prince started exactly where Clockwork Angel left off. Clockwork Angel left me with so many questions. The cliffhanger at the end of the Clockwork Angel seriously made me crave for more Tessa, Will and Jem. Clockwork Prince answered most of my questions. Mostly it answered my questions about Will. Tessas lineage was still a mystery. I loved the twists on this book. It just keeps on getting better and better. There were parts in the book that left my heart beating fast while there were also parts that left my heart aching. It was very fastpaced. There were no dull moments. Clockwork Prince ended in a very surprising way. It was an ending I didnt expect. COMMENTS ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS: WILL HERONDALE: When I reviewed Clockwork Angel I totally vented out all my hatred towards Will. I disliked Will. I detested him. But after reading Clockwork Prince, I felt ashamed. I knew in my heart there was a reason for him being like that. But I chose to judge him. Lesson learned. Dont judge people based on how they act there could be a reason behind it and in Wills case there really was. Will had to act the way he did because he needed to keep people away. His sacrifice crushed my heart. This book shed a new light on Will. He was not who I thought he was. There was more to him than what I had originally thought. I feel bad for him too. Just when the walls around him were finally crumbling, he had to face his biggest heartbreak ever. Will. I am soooo sorry. JAMES CARSTAIRS: Jem has always been my favorite. He was like the most perfect guy or boyfriend you would ever meet. PERFECT for ME not Tessa! Hehehe. He was the type of guy you bring home to meet your parents. He was however still sick. I loved him instantly in Clockwork Angel and I loved him even more in Clockwork Prince. My Jem definitely came out of his shell. I was just so freaking surprised about what happened between him and Tessa! Why oh why JEM!!! Despite my new found love for Will, Jem my heart still belongs to you. Now I know how Tessa feels. Hahaha TESSA GRAY: Tessas character is one of the few that I liked. She wasnt whiny. She doesnt complain a lot. She doesnt have that teen angst that was mostly present on female protagonists. Maybe it was because she was from the Victorian Era I am really not sure. I find Tessa very likeable. Although much was happening around her, it didnt change who she was. She was still very much determined to know who she is and why her brother betrayed her. She was also concerned with what was happening to the Institute. But I think her main struggle was her feelings towards Will and Jem. I envy you for having this kind of stress. Shes so lucky to have two gorgeous boys hovering over her. There was a certain point in the book that I disliked her though. I am a bit overprotective of Jem and I dont want him to get hurt. If she does, I would really get pissed off. Hahaha. Anyways, I am not really sure what Ms. Clare is planning on this very complicated love triangle but I have faith that shell make everything right. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE SECONDARY CHARACTERS? What I love about Ms. Clares novels is the fact that even the secondary characters have their own story. Charlotte and Henrys struggles were not only those related to the Institute but also their married life. They werent sure what they meant to each other. Fortunately, everything was cleared out here in the Clockwork Prince. Sophie and Gideons relationship was something I was not expecting. I thought they were just perfect for each other. Benedict Lightwoods actions were due to something much deeper than his interest in the position of the head of the Institute. Jessamine Lovelace as before still got to my nerves. She was still a spoiled brat who doesnt listen to anyone but herself. She got what she deserves. Magnus Bane was his usual quirky self. He helped Will like he helped Jace and Clary. Always the helpful warlock. :D There was a funny scene between Magnus and Will. I was laughing my head off as I was reading that. Wonder what Magnus was feeling then? Was it because of Will that he...? Hahaha. Who knows? It doesnt matter if it was because of Will that he changed preferences, I still like him. :D Nathaniel Gray knew something about Tessa but before he could review what it was... Well, you have to find out for yourself. THOUGHTS AND PONDERINGS after I finished the book. Just when most of my questions had been answered, more questions had taken its place. What was Nathaniel going to say? What will happen to Tessa, Will and Jem now? What would Mortimer do to Benedict Lightwood? What would happen to Jessamine? What happened to Wills family? Will they ever find a cure for Jems ailment? Where was the Magister? Who are Tessas parents? Is Tessa part Shadowhunter? Most of questions from the first book had been answered here but then more questions seemed to appear in its place. The love triangle between Tessa, Will and Jem just breaks my heart. Why? Read the book so youll find out. Seriously, this book was amazing. If there were flaws in this book I didnt notice it because I was so entranced with the story that I didnt really mind it there were minor slips. I am so excited to get my hands on Clockwork Princess. GEEZ! Why does it have to take so long before it gets released? I would count the days. I am sure that it would also be worth the wait.
The nittygritty: Hogwarts for assassins! A fantastic start to a new series by one of my favorite authors. Some of you may know Im a huge fan of Jay Kristoffs The Lotus War trilogy, and so it was with much excitement that I started reading his newest series. There are many similarities between the two, most notably Jays writing style, his penchant for drama and violence and quirky female protagonists, and even the inclusion of an animal sidekick. Honestly, even if his name hadnt been on the cover of Nevernight, I would have immediately guessed that Kristoff was the writer. But there are differences as well, and you can tell by my fivestar rating that I enjoyed these differences very much. Where Stormdancer was set in a fantastical feudal Japan, Nevernight takes place in a world that has strong Roman influences. Its an interesting mix of very formal speech and teenage slang that somehow just worked for me. Theres also humor in this book, which gave it a lighter feel than his first trilogy. Now dont get me wrong, theres plenty of heavy stuff going on hereassassination, revenge, imprisonment, torturebut its all tempered with lighter, funnier moments that give the reader a chance to breathe. Mia Corvere is a young girl who has had everything taken away from her. At age ten, she was forced to watch her father die on the gallows, hanged for treason, while her mother and baby brother were taken away and thrown into prison. Mia herself was nearly drowned by the same men who killed her father, but she managed to escape when a cat made of shadows rescued her. Ever since, shes been studying as a fledgling assassin with Mercurio, a man who understands her need for vengeance and has prepared her to join the Red Church, a secret school for assassins. Mia sets out to become an Acolyte in the church and joins other potential students, each with their own reasons for being there. But as classes begin, Mia realizes the road to becoming a fullfledged Blade, the highest honor given to an Acolyte, is fraught with danger at every turn. Not only are twentyplus students competing for only four Blade spots, but their teachers are trying to kill them. For in order to be a proper assassin, one must not only learn how to kill, but how to avoid death. Mia and her fellow Acolytes study in the Hall of Songs skill with blades, the Hall of Masks the secrets of seduction, the Hall of Pockets thievery and lock picking and the Hall of Truths poisons, and each day is more dangerous than the next. As their ranks begin to thin, only the most adept will earn one of the four top spots, and the competition is not only fierce, but deadly. Mia is so close to finally being able to avenge her family, but will she succeed? So what did I love about Nevernight? Well, lets start with the worldbuilding. Kristoff is no slouch at creating intricate worlds that completely immerse the reader, and this book is no exception. This time hes built a world ruled by three suns, which remain in the sky in various combinations some setting at different times than others for a full two and a half years before night falls and thats where the word nevernight comes in. Kristoff plays with the themes of light and dark throughout the book, not only with the suns, but with a group called the Luminatii, who not only worship the suns and curse the darkness, but are the very group of men responsible for Mias fathers death. Mia herself is a darkin, someone who is able to control the shadows around her, so in a sense, Kristoff has reversed the traditional meanings of light and dark, making the bad guys the followers of light, while Mia seeks the relief of the shadows. I loved this idea, especially when we learn more about Mias abilities as a darkin. There is a bit of a Harry Potter vibe to this story, in the sense that it reminded me of the classes and teachers at Hogwarts. Despite the seriousness of the Acolytes situation, there is a certain sense of wonder within the halls of the Red Church and in the streets of Mias home in Godsgrave, like the magical way the Acolytes travel from one place to another unseen, and the stunning abilities of a woman known as the Weaver, who is able to miraculously heal mortal wounds. As you can imagine, in a school for assassins, students acquire mortal wounds all the time... Which brings me to the footnotes. As we learn in the beginning, an unnamed narrator is telling us Mias story, and as the book progresses, he often stops to comment on certain worldbuilding elements in the form of footnotes. This was a clever way to get those elements across to the reader without resorting to info dumps although one could argue that footnotes are exactly thatinfo dumps!. But what I loved about them was that you can skip them if you want tothey dont seem to impact the actual story one way or another. However, I found myself reading them all the same, even though they did interrupt the flow a bit, but because I was so fascinated by this world, the footnotes added an extra layer and made the world that much more interesting. Also, our narrator has a wry and snarky humor that I loved, so not only were the footnotes interesting, but entertaining as well. I also have an inkling of who the narrator may be, but well just have to wait and see... For such a large cast of characters, I felt Kristoff did a great job at fleshing out their personalities. Mia has enough flaws that she doesnt come off as ridiculously perfect. Her nose is crooked and she doesnt seem to have much talent for fighting with blades. But her heart knows what it wants, and she never loses sight of the reason she came to Red Church. Then there is Tric, another acolyte who ends up being a romantic interest for Mia, a boy named Hush who never speaks, and a rather nasty girl named Jessamine who gets on Mias bad side right off the bat. Each of the adult characters has a distinct personality, and my favorites were a mysterious librarian named Chronicler Aelius who befriends Mia, and a teacher named Spiderkiller who teaches the acolytes about poisons. And I cant write this review without mentioning Mister Kindly, the shadow cat who follows Mia wherever she goes and drinks her fears and feeds on her nightmares. The further you read, the more you learn about Mia and her darkin nature, and when she discovers what she can do, its very cool! Its been pointed out by other reviewers that Kristoffs prose leans towards purple, and that his writing is at times overwrought and flowery. But although I did run across a phrase or two that was a little too out there for me for example: ...a burst of profanity so colorful you could fling it into the air and call it a rainbow., it wasnt enough to make a dent in my rating, obviously! So before this review becomes too long or has it reached that point already?, let me wrap things up by saying this: Nevernight is a fantastic start to a new series, with characters that will make you want to follow them to the next book, and the next. Thrilling, horrifying, bloody, dangerous, funny and intricately plotted, fans of Jay Kristoff will not be disappointed, and new readers will most likely run straight to the bookstore to check out his backlist. Big thanks to the publisher for supplying a review copy.  O gentlefriend, you knew I was going to add a footnote to this review, didnt you? In this case, I want to mention that this book has several very graphic sex scenes, and so Nevernight may not be appropriate for younger readers.This review originally appeared on Books, Bones  Buffy
 spoiler alert  Hiya guys Ria here and today I am going to be discussing The Mime Order by Samantha Shannon. This is the second book in the bones season series, and it was thoroughly enjoyable one. I love the twists and turns this book has to offer and I dont want to wait until November of next year to read the next book. This bookish reaction might have spoilers present, dont hate me if there is. This is a second book of a series after all. Summery: This book takes place where the bones season left off maybe a couple of weeks afterwards. Paige Mahoney, the main character of the series, is struggling with her identity and keeping low from the government because she is wanted all over the Citadel. Jaxon Hall, her boss and her Mime Lord, things that he could keep things as they were before. This is not the case with Paige because she wants to make it known to Scion that the Raiphates exist. This book goes through the events of the corrupt mime order, and how page makes it known to Scion that she is a threat to reckon with. Characters: Paige: I feel like with her character she has developed so much and she has become a more powerful figure in the series. She at first was scared of a lot of the people inside of the Citadel, but she learns to get a backbone and she becomes the Mime Queen at the very end of the story. The romance between her and warden is so adorable and I love them so much. I almost thought that they were not going to get together, but this book proved me wrong by the end. She gains a lot of followers and she becomes something that she never thought she could be. I hope that she overcomes all the obstacles in her way by the end of the series. Warden: He is a main love interest in the series if you havent read the first book already. He is almost like Paiges anchor, and at first he seems cold and it put me off. He does redeem himself by the middle of the book where he confesses to Paige that he was not trying to be like his race usually is. He does gather his race of people and gather them around Paige becoming her allies. There is a steamy romance happening between them, and I am very happy on how this relationship is blooming. Nick: He is as cute as ever, in is like a big brother to Paige. You see his relationship with Zeke bloom, and it is so adorable. My only concern with him now is that Zeke sides with Jaxon Hall and is most likely going to go against Nick at some point in the series. I thought that they loved each other that much that he would not want to go against him but it looks like thats not the case. Nick even though he was with Zeke still would pick Paige over him, and that is how you see that Nick is very loyal to Paige. Jaxon Hall: Even though he becomes an antagonist by the end of this book I still really love his character. I feel like Jaxon is very misunderstood and there is more to his character that Samantha has not shown up yet. He uses cutie nicknames for most of the females in this book, but that just add to his interesting character. He turns out to be working with Nashira which is a total plot twist by the end of this book. I feel like if he was more open minded and was wanting to help page maybe he wouldnt have been in the situation that he was in the last couple of chapters, but maybe I havent see more of this character yet that might not make him redeeming so I guess Im going to leave him at that. The Aybuss: She ends up dying by the end of this book but she was also a very prevalent character to at least the second book, so I thought I would mention her. She was more of a pond to somebody elses game then she was an enemy, their first you think that she has redeeming qualities about her but she ends up just being filth. She works under somebody else which you find out in the middle of story that makes her not very nice character, and she kills all of the people in her way. That ends up backfiring on her when Paige becomes Under Queen. Nashira: Even though she is the main antagonist of this tale she was not mentioned a lot in this book in particular. Of course she is always a threat to Paige but she ends up not showing up until the very end of the story. She has more allies that Paige can even think about and she is probably the most of a threat to Scion. Now that Paige and Nashira are at War I wonder where the story is going to go. There is more characters but I cant get to all of them or else this would be a very long post. Conclusion: I give this book a 5 out of 5 stars. I think that the bone season series is actually going very very well and I hope to see a progress in the right direction like it is going now. I feel like there is going to be more action in the next book I feel like theres going to be more relationship statuses in the next book and of course there is going to be more blood. Overall I really really like the series I cant wait for the next book. There is nothing really bad to say about the ratings good the flight is good and the author has very descriptive details in the writing. That is what sucks you into this book and I wish that I got done with it sooner but I had a lot of stuff to do. So good day to you all and I hope that you have a fantastic night.
Oh my freaking godaEURI think Ive managed to pull all of my hair out. How in the world can I wait until January to get the continuation to that kind of brutal cliffhanger? I cant. I need Cracked Kingdom. STAT! Geezus, what just happened? I think Im still in shock. That ending left my mind stark blank and in a hell of a daze. My emotions are a complete jumbled mess. My thoughts have left me long ago, somewhere in the middle of all this. And my heart... the poor thing is just battered and bruised, barely beating inside my chest. I seriously feel like Im in some kind of trance, and I need to come back down and deal with how much this book, this Royal, has RUINED ME. Sometimes boring is good. ItaEURtms in the quiet you hear the heart beat. Ever since Ive read the first book in the Royals series, I already knew I needed Eastons bookaEURI needed to hear his story. We all know how confused, lost and troubled this boy is, no matter how much he covers everything up with his covert playfulness and flirty remarks. And lets not forget his struggle with addiction. These are all his defense mechanisms in trying to deal with something none of us could even comprehend. Until this book. He, of all people, deserves a love like no other. One that would save him from drowning in the messes he always finds himself in. One that would ground him and somehow tame that wildness in him. IaEURtmm the design flaw in the Royal family, the one who isnaEURtmt quite like the others, the one who crashes and burns more often than not. Easton has always been my favorite Royal boy. Theres just something about his lighthearted and buoyant demeanor that covers up that black hole of ugliness and pain inside of him that beckons to my hungry heart. His immaturity mightve been too much at times, but thats what makes him Easton Royal. He may also be a huge ass and a walking disaster, especially when hes blackout drunk as he likes to put it, but when you get peeks of those vulnerabilities and insecurities he locks inside his own head, you wouldnt stand a chance against him. This Royal Mess will slay you hard and deep. Hes the middle child who craves all the attention from other people, but it stems from something more fathomless than we think. Hes just so much more than he appears to be. Peeling each and every layer to Easton Royal was so incredibly satisfying, yet intensely heartbreaking at the same time. Every layer you strip off is like taking a blow to the heart and the gut. The more he shows his true colors and his real emotions, youll just want to save him and wrap him up in a bear hug that lasts forever. Hartley is alone. And thereaEURtms something about her loneliness that strikes a chord in me. This is the first time I actually meet the girl who steals Eastons heart and attention, and I must say, I absolutely loved the mystery to her storyaEURit wasnt a pretty one nor a walk in the park, but it had me hooked, intrigued and at the edge of my seat the whole time. Since she got introduced, I cant help but keep on guessing what happened to her, why shes in such a bind or how she came to such circumstances in life. I found it utterly addictiveaEURlike picking up cookie crumbs that lead you to the grand prize. Hartley Wright was quite the character. I fell in love with how real she was and how she never took Eastons BS. I wouldnt say she was immune to the guy, but her selfcontrol was stupendous. And in the end, youd begin to understand how she truly had all the motivation to hold on to that kind of restraint. I admired HartleyaEURhow she kept to herself and did her best to survive. When you get to know this girl and learn about the sacrifices she was forced to make, youd want to cheer her on and just wish for the gods to grant her all the goodness this world could offer from here on out. Up here, time stops. ItaEURtms a freeze frame. Me, her, the endless sky. Easton and Hartleys relationship was nothing short of complicated. It was frustrating and maddening more often than not, but it was unique and it was theirs. It may have started as a challenge for Easton, since Hartley was basically the first girl to turn him down and want nothing to do with him, but that chemistry brewing between them was undeniably electrifying. Hartley got under Eastons skin so much that he even resorted to building a friendship with her instead. This may also sound cheesy, but these two have that deepseated understanding that connects their souls to each other. They complement and help each other more than anyone else could. And they have these moments where youll just want to pause and drink it all in. It was crazy magnetizing and felt so monumental. Like you know its going to start being unhealthy, but you just cant stopaEURIm pretty sure its the Easton Royal effect. Fallen Heir was so much more than I ever expectedaEURjust when I thought nothing could ever stump me and shock me stupid after the bombs dropped left and right from the first three books, I shouldnt have expected any less from Eastons tale. And to think that this is only half of it! Erin Watt has taken me on such an insane whirlwind of a journey already and, call me a masochist, but I still want need more. These Royals are seriously going to be the death of me. Theyre like an addiction you wont be able to shake once you step inside their world. Follow me on: Instagram aEURC Facebook aEURC Twitter
This review and others can be seen in all its proper formatting glory on my blog Beauty and the Bookshelf. Possibly 3.5 stars. I was eager to read Saint Anything since I first heard about it solely for the fact that its a new Sarah Dessen novel. My love for Sarah Dessens novels began when I was a freshman in high school and I read This Lullaby my second favorite novel of hers, with the first being Along for the Ride, and since then I have read all of her books except for The Moon and More, which I have yet to finish. I dont love all her books, and I prefer the ones that have more romance over the ones that dont. Could you imagine a Sarah Dessen novel that was solely focused on romance?! I WANT ONE. That said, Sarah Dessen is one of my favorite authors. And when you have a favorite author, you have this expectation and hope when you read one of their books: that youll love it. You either will or you wont, and for Saint Anything, well... Sydney Stanford has sort of lived in the shadow of her bad boy brother, whos currently in jail after he did something horrible while driving drunk spoiler alert: he hits a kid and puts him in a wheelchair for life. Despite the fact that her brother Peytons been on a train just waiting to wreck, her parentsnamely, her motherseem relatively shocked that Peyton is in jail. While Sydney avoids his phone callsthey have nothing to say to each other, and he wont let her come visitshe tries to accumulate to her new public school, where she transferred to from her swanky private one after her brothers accident and sentence. Its there that she meets new friends and gets to escape from home, where her dads always working, her mother acts like nothing bad happened and Peyton is essentially innocent, and Sydney tries to stay a million feet away from Peytons creepy friend Ames. Saint Anything felt like a Sarah Dessen novel, yet it didnt. Ive seen some reviews and blurbs calling it one of her darker novels, and while it has some darkness which Ill go into later, I wouldnt call it dark, especially when her other books have dealt with dark subjects like drugs, rape, and domestic abuse and violence. But Saint Anything had this aspectthis sort of thrilling, tense, suspenseful aspect created by one single character, and that aspect kept the pages turning as you tried to figure out what this character wanted, what the hell they would do, and how far Dessen might go. That was a new thing, I think, that Ive seen from Dessen though I havent read most of her books for years. And there was definitely a lot of elements here that scream Dessen: family issues, hints of romance, friendship, cameos and known references i.e. Spinnerbait, Anger Management, a certain character who makes coffee..., and just the writing you read and you know its a Sarah Dessen book. And yet, there was something else about this book, and I cant quite put my finger on it. I liked this book. I really, really did, definitely more so than not. Probably four stars. But I didnt love it. It has a major pageturner quality and I read it in like a day, which is always a good sign. And its higher up on my list of Dessen favorites, too. I did have a few issues with it, though, although theyre more like personal preferences. Scenes would end before I wanted them to, leaving me wanting more. The second chapter was a big info dump and I felt like I didnt really understand what was going and what Peyton had doneand I felt like I was missing other little bits, too, throughout. And the ending was good, but again, I wanted more. I always want more when a Sarah Dessen book ends. Really, I think that last bit is more of a thing with contemporary novels. Their endings never seem to fully satisfy and wrap things up how I want them, and I always want more. For, say, fantasy novels, a big part of the story might be the world, because the world isnt a world we know or live in. So when the book or series wraps up, it typically does so in a way that gives all the answers and satisfies the reader. Because in fantasy worlds, you cant just end the story by saying the world went on, because we dont have any idea what that looks like unless the book tells us. But in contemporaries, the world is our world, so we know how it goes on, and we dont need all the answers and a nice little bow wrapped around The End. So, in the end, I want more. Sorry for the little tangent. As for the story itself, it had similarities to My Life Next Door, but not in a bad way. This was mainly because of the Chathams, a family Sydney meets and spends time with and falls for especially a certain pizza delivery boy, and she also finds a good best friend. The Chathams own a pizza place, where Dad, Mac, and Layla Chatham work. They also have an older sister whos trying to get back into ice skating, and a mother with ALS. For Sydney, the Chathams are like her family away from her family, and I really liked them. I was also a fan of the group of friends she made at school, and all their little dynamics. I really love groups like that in books and movies. Sydney herself was a likable character who learns to get a bit of a backbone and branch out somewhat, and I enjoyed her story, even if it wasnt a fluffy sort of story. I would have liked to see more about her brother, and her parents were, well...kind of ugh. And dont even get me started on Ames. Saint Anything is an interesting novel with compelling aspects and pizza, music, and YumYums like Dum Dums. Its strong points were its romance, characters, pageturning and engrossing quality, and points of tension and suspense, while it fell just a little bit short in leaving me wanting more. Its certainly a good novel, and one that I liked, and as far as Sarah Dessen novels go, Id peg this toward the middle in the terms of how good it is. But its an interesting one, this one. Yeah, its interesting. Something new and out of the box from Dessen is nice, though. But seriously, I want a romancebased novel, STAT. And Im still a big Sarah Dessen fan, forever and always. I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review, and that in no way sways my opinion of the book.
Originally posted at City of Books   OHMYGOD I loved this book so much! Definitely better than Shatter Me, and if this series keeps getting better then I absolutely cannot wait for book 3! Unravel Me was even better than I expected, and believe me, I had very high expectations. There was just so much in this book  fastpaced plot, loads of action, very shocking twists, and swoonworthy romance! I liked Juliette a lot better in this one, she really came into her element. Shes a lot more dangerous and unpredictable in this book, and I found that fascinating. Her power is unbelievably immense, and no one knows just how strong she is. But despite the fact that so much has changed for her, shes still as good as she was in Shatter Me. Shes still on the right path, and her newfound strength hasnt made her arrogant or vain in any way. I really felt for her in this book, because her anguish was so unbearable to see! Even I wanted to punch someone in the face when she got mad. Juliette faces a lot of dilemmas in Unravel Me, but I think she made the right choices. Shes very selfsacrificing, always putting the safety of others before her, and she definitely deserves a lot more happiness in her life. Heres to hoping she gets that soon! Adam, on the other hand, I didnt like very much in Unravel Me. I honestly loved him in Shatter Me, but he seems to have had a personality change in this one. Hes too clingy, too whiny. Honestly, the number of times he begged in this book... I was quite disappointed in him. What happened to the awesome guy we met in the first book? Not to say he isnt still awesome, because he is. His love for Juliette has grown, and we see the lengths he is willing to go to, so he can be with her. I found myself feeling sorry for him a lot of times in this novel. Even though he annoyed me sometimes, I still want him to have a happy ending. Adam gets a huge revelation in this book, and it really shocked me. I was left staring at the page with my mouth hanging open, and again I felt so sorry for Adam! He really is a sweet guy, but Im still Team Warner all the way. Warner. The reason I read this book. Just kidding, I would have read it anyway. But Warner made it so much better! I was desperately reading this book as fast as I could just to meet Warner, and when he finally showed up, my reading pace slowed down. That first scene with him was incredibly sweet, and I knew then that I would love this book. We find out Warners first name, and I think it really suits him! I now think of him by that name, and not Warner, because thats how he wants Juliette to think of him. And chapter 62? Oh my god. I had heard a LOT about chapter 62 before I read this book, and I think it was the most anticipated part of the book. And man, was it good! I read it as slowly as possible to drag out the moment. Let me just say that Team Adam peeps arent going to be too happy with this scene ; Oh, and theres some other stuff we find out about Warner, very exciting stuff that made me very happy. Wow, I just realized how many secrets are revealed in this book! There were so many awesome moments between Juliette and Warner, and it was nice to see them talking to each other normally, like friends, slowly getting to know one another. Its like the events in Shatter Me didnt even happen, because theyve moved past it. Theres this one quote I found hilarious  Do you like Shakespeare? he asks me. An odd segue. I shake my head. All I know about him is that he stole my name and spelled it wrong. You dont normally find Juliette making jokes, so this was quite unexpected. And I think it shows that maybe Warner brings out the best in her. With Adam, shes usually quiet and sad and selfloathing, but with Warner shes actually normal. And yeah, Juliette is meant to be with Warner, I dont care what anyone else says! I want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. I mean seriously, how can you not love this guy?? Okay, enough of Warner... for now. Kenji is the humourous reprieve in this somewhat serious book. Seriously, he had me laughing at so many parts, since he makes jokes at totally inappropriate moments. He really reminds me of Roar from Veronica Rossis Under the Never Sky series. If youve read that, I think you would agree with me. Kenji is easygoing and very smooth, but he does show a lot of wisdom in this book. He keeps Juliette grounded, and I quite liked the pep talks he gave her. I never thought Kenji could be so intense! I really want a novella from his point of view, because Id love to get inside his head. Even though Kenji is the easiest to talk to, no one knows much about him or his past. And thats the Kenji I want to know. Nothing will ever be the same again. Man, is Juliette right when she thinks this! Unravel Me changes a lot of things in the series, and puts some perspective into them. The war is near, and the people of Omega Point are as ready as theyll ever be. With Warners dad heading the Reestablishment, things are looking grim. But Omega Point has something that the Reestablishment doesnt  Juliette. And theyll use her to gain the upper hand. Tahereh Mafis writing is, of course, beautiful as always. The words flowed off the pages so smoothly, kind of like butter. And the strikethroughs were still there, though less than in Shatter Me. I liked seeing those there, because they tell you a lot more than the actual words do. Theres this one quote that really got to me, and I applaud Tahereh for writing it this way because it has that much more of an impact. What I really want to say is who the hell are you and who are you to decide who gets to die. Who are you to decide who should be killed. Who are you to tell me which father I should destroy and which child I should orphan and which mother should be left without her son, which brother should be left without a sister, which grandmother should spend the rest of her life crying in the early hours of the morning because the body of her grandchild was buried in the ground before her own. This amazing writing on its own is enough to make me love this book, and its just so emotional! Unravel Me on the whole is a fantastic sequel to Shatter Me, and it set the scene perfectly for the final book. I honestly dont think I can wait a whole year to find out how Juliettes story ends! I want to read this book over and over again until I get book 3, and I know I wont get bored. Not with this epic plot and awesome characters and elegant writing.
Joint review from Willow  Donna  The Romance Cover Shes mine. She always has been, she always will be. Willow: I can still remember when you convinced me to read the Opportunist, I had been putting off because I heard it was emotionally draining, but you said that it was one of the best books youd read so I had a go at it. I remember finishing it and being a little angry that I didnt get my HEA, but I started to think that both Caleb  Olivia were fked up and would only destroy one another if they were together, so I was actually really scared going into this one, especially when I saw the blurb saying Caleb was going to fight for her. I have always been team Caleb secretly but we can see Tarryn is so good at writing a big mess of a relationship. What where you thoughts before you started reading? Donna: I was nervous and reluctant, I had been waiting so LONGGGGGG for this book, I wanted my HEA for Caleb and Olivia, as you know I have always been team Caleb and knowing what a mind FK Tarryn likes to dish out I was anxious. It was a case of I so want to open this book now, dare I open this book now, is Tarryn going to kill me with this book....oh shit just open the damn book and start...so I did. Willow: Well we did have that conversation about me helping you bury Tarryn if we didnt get our HEA for them!!! Again this book had a different feel than TO  DR, and I think that its great all three books felt different to me, they all felt like their characters personality. TO was angst filled and difficult at times, DR was down right ugly and whilst Thief was not perfect it was more caring that the other two books. Donna: I think that we saw a very different side to Caleb in this book, whilst in TO although I wanted them to be together I thought he was a stupid selfish git at times and so tactless, yet in this book, through the past chapters we got to see the real Caleb, the real turmoil, his real thoughts and feelings and that just made me fall in love with him even more...all of their crap that was dished out, whilst was their own fault to some extent, layed firmly at the feet of Leah and despite everything she even tried again in this book Selfish, selfcentered Caleb Drake loved a girl so much he could already feel himself changing to accommodate her needs. I fell. Hard. For the rest of this life and probably the next. I wanted her  every last inch of her stubborn, combative, catty heart. Willow: My heart totally broke 100 times for Caleb in this book, he was trying so hard and I totally agree with you, I thought in previous books he was just as manipulative as Olivia and Leah well maybe not Leah  she is the queen of bitches but I too fell in love with Caleb in this one. God. I think of Olivia now and a peace settles over me. She might not be mine, but Im hers. Its no use even fighting it anymore. I just keep falling flat on my face and then rolling toward her. If I cant have Olivia Kaspen, then Ill be alone. She is a disease I have. After ten years, I am finally realizing that I cant cure it with other women Donna: My heart broke for Caleb a lot and I must admit I was getting pretty pissed at Olivia, she was giving out so many mixed signals to Caleb and then she would just go and break his heart all over again. I was worried when he went away for work as I thought that may have been the nail in the coffin but was glad that fate had other ideas It was a lie. I knew it was a lie, even as I said it. Ive never loved anyone after you. I never will. I walk out. Walk away. No more fighting  not for her, or with her, or with myself. I am so sad. Willow: I hated Olivia at one point! I choose him  you are right it was a roller coaster of up and downs for poor Caleb, as it always is with these two: Leah No, I say. I dont want to talk about Leah. Fine, she says. Wheres Noah? She looks away. Please stop asking me that. Why? Because it hurts to answer. I consider her for a moment and nod. Youre going to have to tell me eventually. Eventually. She sighs. That word is so us, isnt it? Eventually, youll tell me youre faking your amnesia. Eventually, Ill tell you that Im pretending not to know you. Eventually, well come back together, fall apart, come back together. Willow: Through the first part of the book I was wondering where Leah was. Then bam, everything she did after that kinda made up for her absence in the first part dont you think? Lets talk about Noah  I was convinced before going into Thief that there was something not right about him, I thought no one is that perfect and although we heard a bit more about him, I was actually disappointed there wasnt more. Donna: Like you I thought that there was something missing with him, whether it was like a set up or something...he just seemed too sugary sweet with bows and flowers, but actually he was actually that nice, he had his own demons to deal with, but if I was him, knowing my future wife was in love with another man, I couldnt have done it. Their marriage was doomed from the start especially when the other factors were thrown into the mix. My heart did break for Olivia in the epilogue, having been there and done that...but luckily for me, my outcome was so different, I was just so sad that mother nature took away that HEA for her. Willow: Yes the ending. As you know Im a cold hearted bitch, it takes a lot for me to cry at a book, and I did cry at Thief. It was like every time Tarryn gave us something good it was bitter sweet because she took something else away. In true Tarryn style it was heartbreaking and messy! Donna: This book was extremely emotional for me, but we needed to get inside Calebs head and Tarryn did it brilliantly. We got so many questions answered which we soooo needed. After getting these answers it just made me angry, if only they talked...then all this heart break could have been avoided, but then if they did talk we never would have got 3 amazing books...ying and yang and all that!! Willow: Totally agree! I loved this book, I felt it was a good ending to the trilogy. The way it has been written with each book told from each of the three personalities and even a bit from Noah was genius. I loved the back and forth between past and present. It was easy to read and brought out a lot of emotions, hurt, anger, betrayal and hate, but also hope, longing and love  however fked up that love was. But most of all it felt real, ok maybe an extreme side of real, but there was no insta love, they had to work hard for it. In real life love isnt always hearts and flowers, sometimes it is messy and Fcked up and Tarryn has certainly written about that alternative side of love. For me this was an easy 5 star read. Donna: I totally agree, love is never guaranteed and it is always a work in progress, you have to want it, nurture it, fight for it. It can be messy but if it was all hearts and flowers life would be incredibly boring. As you say, this is real life, maybe a bit extreme with Leahs shenanigans but very real none the less. I was glad they got a relative HEA in the end, despite the twist at the end, even though it was not the ending I would have liked. But, it was the ending that this trilogy deserved, it was never perfect, so a perfect ending would have done the book an injustice. With all that being said and having had time to reflect and digest and get my head round it, I will give it a 5 too, it deserves it!! Although that darn ending was just urgggghhhhhh, it needed to be done.
Im trying to crank out this entire series before A Conjuring of Light drops next week and so far, Im really liking it. A Darker Shade of Magic is full of mystery and magic and strong personalities that transverse different Londons and leap off the page. PROS: Balance. SO MUCH BALANCE. Not only with the different characters and settings  each being distinct and well developed on their own and in relation to each other and the world at large  but as such a major theme in the story. Red London believes that magic was meant to be used, but not abused, and wielded with both reverence and caution. The people are also judged and treated differently depending on the amount of magical ability they have been blessed with, which Kell calls aven essen, divine balance. For them, power exists in balance and it was so cool to really see that balance flow in both the story structure and message through the entire novel . Worlds. Each London is so well crafted, not only in their imagery, but in their culture and way of life. Red London thrives with magic and seeks to balance its chaotic nature. Black London embraced the chaos of magic and was consumed by it. White London seeks more magic and more power. And Grey London has all but forgotten magic entirely. Each city is unique, but they are all connected not only in name but through their histories  and how those histories have been remembered greatly influences their current relationships. Magic. The magic is so richly steeped in the story and its done in such a beautiful way. I love that magic is about intention and strength of will, not physical strength or a blessed inheritance. Magic is not a studied task that can be easily manipulated or contained, its a reactionary power that grows and changes and can be dangerous. Again balance is key. Characters. I latched onto so many characters. Kell is a great MC  hes a bit of a vagabond. He is one of the only people who can travel to these different worlds and yet he feels like he doesnt really belong in his home. But he longs for it  he spends so much time in the taverns conducting business because its a fixed point in each London and it makes him a fixed point too. He wants to truly belong and not feel like a possession of the crown. He has grown up with great privilege and has adopted the arrogance of a royal, but he treasures worthless trinkets for their ingenuity and has an earnestness that pulls you in. Rhy is charming, charismatic, and immediately likable. He is a bit arrogant and not used to hearing the word no, but he is caring and widely respected among the people of Red London. He cares deeply for the people and wants to be his best for them and even though he was born into a position of power, he doesnt have a strong magical gift. Even though he suspects Holland is lying about the necklace, he still takes it because he wants to become a more proficient magic wielder  not because hes vain, but because he wants to be a better ruler for his people . I also really liked Holland. I just found him to be really mysterious and he drew me into the story. I questioned his motives, his history, and what he was going to do next. He was a really great contrast to Kell, with each one really embodying the values of their respective Londons and providing a nice balance within the story. Questions.I have so many questions at the end of this book, but in a good way. Its in an anticipatory what the hell is going to happen next kind of way and not in a youve left me unsatisfied kind of way. I want to know whats going to happen with Holland? How is Lila going to get her boat and where is going to travel to? Why is her eye missing? Is that even relevant? How is her magic going to be unlocked? Will Kell have any side effects from the stone trying to possess him? Does Kell and Rhys relationship change because they are bonded? So many question and I cant wait to find out what happens next. CONS: Lila. I have a lovehate relationship with Lila. I liked her immediately at her introduction. Shes a bit of a daredevil and a bleeding heart for those in trouble she goes to help the little boy whose coins are stolen despite being out numbered 3 to 1 . I like that she knows what she wants in life. She has a goal, a drive, and I respect that. She is headstrong, determined, hard working, and resourceful. BUT I also found her to be frustrating at times. She is supremely arrogant and has a bit of a superiority complex, especially when she has absolutely no idea about the different worlds or magic and currently no access to magic on her own. Like Kell, Lila wants freedom, but her freedom is adventure  an escape. She is reckless in her pursuit of it and it endangers herself and others. Tension. For a book with such high stakes I feel like there wasnt much tension at all. There were a few moments of suspense as conflicts began to build, but the resolutions happened too quickly to have much of an impact, especially towards the end of the book. After Kell and Lila make it to White London they split up to fight Athos and Astrid respectively. Kell and Athos magic battle back and forth we dont see a lot of movements here, its relatively contained. As the battle is building, Athos creates a serpent to fight Kell, but he cannot control it and it turns on him pretty quickly and kills him letting Kell get the other half of the stone. It seemed like just as the fight was getting started it ended. As this is happening, Lila sneaks into the throne room to try and kill Astrid, but is overpowered fairly easily and Astrid uses a spell to look like her so she can kill Kell, who is sort of out of it because he joined the two stone halves. However, as soon as AstriddisguisedasLila reached Kell he just knows that it isnt really Lila and stabs her. Again there was the treat of conflict, but it was resolved before it got started. After killing Astrid, the stone is dispelled of magic but they are both still in White London  unsure if Lila can safely travel back without using its power. They have a heartfelt moment they even kiss mirroring their first world jumping experience together, join hands and walk through the door to Red London and Kell lands alone. My heart almost shattered at the loss, but before it could we see Lila a few feet away and shes fine. Dont get me wrong, Im SUPER happy she made it, I just feel like the potential of tension and suspense was there and it just wasnt utilized. Overall I am really happy with this book and the things I loved easily outweigh the things that disappointed me. The world and characters that Schwab created are so vivid and captivating, and the story is fresh and smart. I would definitely recommend this to fans of fantasy and magical realism and anyone who appreciates well developed characters and an engaging plot.
Release Date: May 22, 2012 Publisher: Feiwel and Friends Format: Hardcover, 324 pages 9781250003324 Source: Purchased from Mysterious Galaxy Emma McIntosh has always felt a little different after a freak accident in the water left her convinced a school of fish saved her life. Years later, while on vacation in Florida with her best friend, Emma has a runin with an attractive but strange young man who takes an immediate interest in her. Galen Forza, who happens to be a human ambassador for a species of merfolk called Syrena, can sense something is off about Emma, and his theory about the girl proves correct after a dangerous encounter with a shark. Now, he begins to wonder if she might be the one person who can unite the underwater kingdoms of Triton and Poseidon, but Galen is not the only one who recognizes this gift and an unknown underwater presence has also taken an interest in Emma. I smack into him as if shoved from behind. He doesnt budge, not an inch. Ohmysweetgoodness, Im not even sure where to begin with this, Of Poseidon was just a slippery mess of weirdness and possessed some serious flaws that caused me to cringe page after page, and unfortunately, the book does not get any better as it progresses. The story itself is pretty basic, and includes your typical girl with a special gift meets boy with an eye for the quirky girl who must join forces to make the world a more magical place. However, the story just sort of floundered around for the entirety of the novel with our leads, Emma and Galen, not really progressing at all or even putting much effort into furthering either their relationship or the inherent mystery surrounding Emmas unusual circumstances. The jacket description on the book is also wildly deceiving, as it makes it seem as though Galen is the lead character. The scenes told from Emmas POV which is the bulk of the story are told from first person, while the Galen scenes are told from third person, making this bizarre contrast incredibly awkward for the reader and ultimately only added to the weird factor permeating the story. These issues, however, were just the tip of the iceberg, and if Galen wants his romantic date below the sea swimming among the remains of an infamous ghost ship, were gonna need to hit this iceberg a little harder. Lets dive! Why dont we start with the characters, as they are typically an integral part of a wellwritten story. Emma McIntosh, our lead heroine, is clumsy, forgetful, spiteful, and quite frankly I was beginning to wonder how shes navigated through her high school classes with straight As, or life in general, given her continual lack of intelligence or even the ability to perform perfunctory actions. I personally responded very poorly to Emma and found her to be not just obnoxious, but downright mean to anyone and everyone she comes in contact with I dont know many people who would react kindly to having a handful of Lemonheads forcefully shoved in their mouth. I would say I cant even begin to imagine what Galen sees in her, but our supposedly smoldering male lead is really no better. Although the Syrena culture states that a male chooses his mate and this coupling is dictated by the men an issue I will get back to in a minute, I find this poor reasoning to allow the lead love interest in a book geared towards teens, or anyone in general, to be so blatantly chauvinistic. Galen, who I can only assume is meant to make readers swoon with his violet eyes and abs that could break concrete, but I found myself at first less than impressed followed by just down right pissed off every chapter he appeared in. Galen is possessive, jealous, dull, and continually puts forth ideas that would place Emma, his object of female desire, about 20,000 leagues below him. After all, he seems to only want a woman who can make a baby and spoon feed him his crab meat. Doesnt that sound like the picture perfect example of domestic bliss? Ah, true love. Not that Galen beats me, but after his little show, what will people think? Seriously, Emma? This sort of behavior is not just reserved for our leads, oh no. The supporting characters also buy into this antiquated Syrena lifestyle. Galens sister, Rayna, whom I thought might be a shining beacon of hope erected to steer the characters ship away from the rocky shores quickly approaching, starts off strongwilled and quite angry at the fact that she is forced into a mating ritual with someone she doesnt love. She even runs swims? away from home and has been hiding out among humans in order to escape this preordained life she has a deep aversion to. I thought, finally! Someone in this story who is willing to think for themselves! I think I may have jumped the gun on that one, because Rayna abruptly decides that her mate, Toraf, is in fact her one true love only after she catches him and Emma kissing on the beach, an act Toraf used simply to make Rayna jealous. So much for that lighthouse, crash away ship! And oh boy, does this ship ever crash! Toraf is goodlooking, funny, and considerate which makes me question Raynas attitude. In addition to the wildly predictable story, there is also the fact that the characters appeared to have the combined IQ of a sea slug and spend 99 of the book trying to solve the mystery of Emmas mysterious heritage and whether or not she is who they think she is. The story spends far too much time in the shallow end of the ocean, floating around with little baby floats and a ducky ring to keep it from getting too far from the shore. Not only this, but there are one too many unexplained plot holes and weird wannabe red herrings which served no purpose but to drag the story out to reach the 300 page mark. Finally, one of the biggest issues I had with this book was the not so subtle trope involving Emmas friend, Chloe, who is not just black, shes a stereotypical black! In addition to being a hothead, Chloe is also described as wearing a weave and fake nails, and as a little added bonus SPOILER ALERT she is killed off at the beginning of the book for no apparent reason other than to get Emma in the water! It is already incredibly difficult to find diversity within the YA genre, but I find it a little strange to kill off the only black character in your story, and then proceed to remind the reader time and time and time again that our heroine is not just white, but porcelain white, albino white, she has trouble wearing makeup because shes so deadly white, shes like Chloes white shadow. Smells a little fishy to me, and I despise fish. If that kiss were real, I might have thrown scholarships to the wind and followed him to our own private island or his underwater kingdom. I might have even cooked him fish. Overall, I am incredibly disappointed with this story, which is a shame because I met the author during the Fierce Reads Tour and she was incredibly funny and sarcastic and I loved the way she described her story and her desire to write a Sasquatch YA romance. Her humor is evident in her writing, and there were many scenes where I actually found myself laughing out loud, but having a humorous novel doesnt make up for a bad story. While I was reading this book, I began to wonder whether it was actually written as a satirical commentary on the YA genre and some of the ridiculousness associated with it, in which case this book would actually be rather clever. Unfortunately, I dont think this was the case and Of Poseidon was just a huge flop laden with plot holes and offensive story arcs. Of course, this is just one persons opinion on the story, but if this seems like something you still want to check out, by all means, Id love to hear other peoples opinions. Of Poseidon just didnt do it for me, and Ive decided to swim on by the next release in the series to seek out more agreeable waters. end sea puns The look in her eyes, the way her mouth hangs open, the way she glances down at the trident on his stomach, is all the confirmation he needs.
We were five people in all in that small room that housed two beds, a little table and other assorted paraphernalia with hardly enough room to move around. He was in his late 70s and with him was his soninlaw, the husband of his second daughter. Two weeks before this, he was diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer. The kind which is inoperable and from which the only respite is death. The suddenness of the diagnosis and its nature of finality made him an angry, bitter man. The initial weeks saw him raging at the doctors, nurses and his wife but then acceptance did come over him eventually. When we met him, he was quiet and speaking mostly of memories from times long ago. The doctors offered the family the alternative between chemotherapy and palliative care and they chose the former, grasping on straws of hope that were virtually nonexistent. The procedure had just started when we met him during that dry and hot Sunday afternoon. The room where we were sitting was across the road from the hospital where the therapy was going on. Before we left the room, he held my hand for a little while and kept looking at me. We didnt speak but I could see that in his mind he was going through the memories of seeing me right from my time as a toddler. We parted with smiles. In the days that followed, the chemotherapy aggravated his pain and suffering and in the end made it difficult even for him to hold down food. Finally it came to the stage where they switched to palliative care and he moved back home. He passed away a month after this but it was a relatively peaceful exit from the mortal realm. Memories of having been a part of the cremation rites are still vivid on my mind for he was my uncle. I finished this book last night before bed and these images passed through my mind before I drifted off to sleep. Atul Gawande has written a very moving book about a topic that we often skip around and avoid talking about : how to die. Death is the ultimate enemy. Its forces are superior in number, its methods are many and no matter what weapons we deploy against it eventually death wins the battle. An unnatural death, an accident are all shocks that jolt us and leave us helpless with impotent sadness or rage. But aging or a lifethreatening illnesses are ones we are baffled with and we resort to the most obvious solution : take the doctors word for granted and pump up the patient with all the treatments we can. The first half of Gawandes book deals with how we deal with aging and the second half on how we struggle through diseases we have no control over. The below passage from the book sums up the general approach we have towards care for the elderly : As one scholar put it, describing the history of the nursing homes from the perspective of the elderly is like describing the opening of the American West from the perspective of the mules ; they were certainly there, and the epochal events were certainly critical to the mules, but hardly anyone was paying very much attention to them at the time. Gawandes stories are poignant retellings of how age catches up with humanity and how powerless it makes us. Stories of grown up children who are left with parents who are almost as demanding as young children is heartbreaking to read about. India is notorious for the way in which it treats the elderly for a good majority are below the middle class. Freak stories of old people locked up in their own homes do pop up once in a while in the media and the author does make mention of a few such cases in his book. Largely, however the topic is on how much traditional means and ways of medicine fails when it comes to treating elder people compassionately. The hope here arises from the mavericks who have built and nurtured assisted living apartments against heavy odds and managed to sustain their enterprise in the process. They are those little pin pricks of light in the darkness. I do not know as to how much these ideas have made their way into India or for that matter, across the other nations in the World. The second half of the book is the more bitter pill to swallow for it deals with the struggles of how we deal with illness and how much we cling on to modern albeit deadlier forms of treatment. Even when we know that chemotherapy and advanced forms of antibiotics are going to render a human being very close to being a vegetable, we persist in the belief that it might make things alright in a short while. Gawande writes : Technology can sustain our organs until we are well past the point of awareness and coherence. Besides, how do you attend to the thoughts and concerns of the dying when medicine has made it almost impossible to be sure who the dying even are ? Is someone with terminal cancer, dementia, or incurable heart failure dying, exactly ? There is also an added empathy to this part of the book for the author witnesses his fathers battle against cancer. This part is quite lyrical to behold for he is equal parts son and doctor while writing about this episode in his life. These two halves of his personal and professional life wrestle for supremacy over his mind as he sees life come full circle for his ailing father. Here again is a quiet yet sharp criticism that he extends to the medical fraternity as to how insensitive we have grown to the patients needs. Doctors have reduced a person with limited time on this planet from a human being to just another body that has to be bombarded with medication. In medicines long ranging war against death, it is the human body that suffers the most. There are no clear winners in this war. I felt disturbed, awed, moved and stunned by this book. This along with Siddhartha Mukherjees The Emperor Of All Maladies has dispelled the myth that books on the topics surrounding medicine does not make for interesting reads. Highly recommended ! The whole theme of this book is more or less an extrapolation of what Dylan Thomas told us a long time ago : Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Fairytales are supposed to have happy endings. And a Cinderella story is no exception. But when the heroine is a cyborg who would prefer to save herself rather than be rescued by a Prince, things get complicated. And when the Prince has more important things to worry about, like saving his country from a deadly plague and trying to forge an alliance with the leader of a cruel race of Lunar people, finding his Princess and falling in love seem trivial. With time quickly running out, finding a cure and deterring a powerful and evil Queen who has her sights set on the Prince seem much more important than happiness. So, unless there really is some kind of magic wand that can make all of it disappear, survival must win out over love. So much for happily ever after. But then again this is not your average Cinderella story.  Cinder is the instantly captivating, wonderfully imaginative and immensely entertaining first book in the Lunar Chronicles. This clever retelling of the classic Cinderella story is even more enchanting than the original, offering more twists and turns, thrills and excitement. It may start with a once upon a time, but this first book in the series wont stop at happily ever after. The fairytale will immediately draw readers in, but it is the charming, adorable and frightening new characters, the futuristic setting of New Beijing, the deadly threats in this new world, and all the fascinating changes and additions to this story that will keep readers utterly spellbound. This enchanting story is at once familiar and strange. Cinder is a mechanic. Forced to work to support her stepmother and stepsisters, only the youngest who is kindhearted, she is hoping one day to gain her freedom. Though freedom is not something so easily given to someone like her. Someone not entirely human. Cinder is a cyborg. Part human, part machine. Looked upon with disgust, she is not seen as an equal. But when she meets the Prince, he only sees the girl, not the machine. And for a brief moment, Cinder can dream of a better life. However, there are bigger problems in New Beijing. A plague that has been ravaging the planet has reached the city, attacking people close to Cinder and the Prince. And with the unsettling arrival of the Lunar Queen, there are far more important things to deal with than falling in love. Even if her notentirelyhuman heart says otherwise. Author Marissa Meyer has completely transformed this classic story. While still recognizable, giving readers that feeling of familiarity, the author altered the characters, the setting and the world to make it feel new and different and a lot more dangerfilled and suspenseful. By adding in the unexpected, giving the story a depth it didnt before have, and creating such memorable characters, the author has breathed new life into this fairytale story with a book that will leave readers anxiously awaiting the next installment. Cinder is a fastpaced, incredibly addictive start to this new series that is a must read for fans of strong heroines, handsome princes, evil stepmothers, wicked queens and for those who enjoy their fairytales with a twist. On a personal note: I listened to it. I read it. I loved it. Its a must read. And an absolute must read again. Cinder is yet another book that I went into with mild trepidation. I heard great things about it, but I was uncertain if it would be a book Id enjoy. Im not a fan of reading science fiction and the idea of a series called the Lunar Chronicles set off all sorts of warning bells in my head. And while the cover is intriguing  both beautiful and creepy  it, too, made me wonder if I would be able to read this book in its entirety. Even without having read the description, the mechanical leg and the title gave me some inkling of what this story would be about. And I just wasnt sure. My fears were completely unfounded. I absolutely loved this story. I could not get enough of it. And when it ended, I just wanted more. I still do. It was warm and engaging, the characters were easy to connect with, the world was totally fascinating and having the fairytale as the foundation for this story kept me riveted. I wanted to pinpoint where the similarities were. I wanted to see where the differences would lead. I wanted to find out if there would be a happily ever after ending for Cinder and Prince Kai. I had both the audiobook and a printed ARC for review and I decided to listen to the audiobook version first and then read it. And Im so glad I did. I was instantly pulled into the story by the narrator. She brought life to the characters and made me want to know them better. She infused these characters with such personality that they were immediately lovable. But even without the narration, this book was just so easy to love and was totally captivating. I couldnt wait to find out if the story followed the same path as original fairytale. Would Cinder leave behind a glass slipper? Would she have a magical transformation that would allow her to dance with the Prince at the ball? I love, love, love what the author did with this part of the story. But because talking about it would be way too spoilery, I just cant. I never thought I could enjoy a book where the main character was a cyborg. But Cinder is lovable and real and not at all the unthinking, unfeeling machine I thought shed be. Although the most adorable character was Iko, the android. She always made me smile, especially when she swooned over Price Kai. Who was definitely swoonworthy. He was handsome and brave and strong and not in the least bit arrogant. Though he totally could have been. And what an amazing job the author did with the Lunar Queen and her entourage. While I wont say too much about them, I will just say that I love how the author connected them with the fairytale. And as far as personality goes  talk about seriously creepy. I cant believe that the wait for book two is a year. I have a millionandahalf questions about what will happen next. And even though I dont feel like Ive been left dangling off a cliff, I do feel like Im suspended in midair, holding my breath until I can dive into the next book in the series.
This book was featured on my post about my best surprises of 2015! Maybe Someday was a dream come true! This novel has definitely solidified Hoover as one of my favorite authors. Her stories are compelling, addictive, and soulsearching. The way Hoover writes is mesmerizing. Right from the start of the novel I felt so connected to Sydney and Ridge. I think the best way to go into Hoovers novel is to not know much at all. All you need to know before reading Maybe Someday is that it follows two young adults, Ridge and Sydney, and what happens after Sydney moves in with him and two other people after she finds out her boyfriend cheats on her. Maybe Someday did so many things to my heart. It kept breaking it and putting it back together again time and time again. I was so anxious to see how the novel was going to end! I couldnt put down Maybe Someday until I finished. Not only is the story captivating, but so are the songs that go along with the story. Throughout the book, Ridge and Sydney both write songs for a band named Sounds of Cedar. Not only are the lyrics in the novel itself, but there is actually music to go along with it. These songs are amazing. Its really cool to decipher the lyrics and actually know what the song is about instead of trying to figure it out. You should definitely check out the website here! The next time I get a gift card to amazon, I am buying the CD to this book. The songs are to die for and they hold so much emotion; theyre so much better than what I expected when I just read the lyrics. One of my favorite quotes from the book is from the titular song, Maybe Someday that says, For her I bend, for you I break. When I read that, my heart did things I didnt even know that they can do. Needless to say, I loved practically everything about the book! The pacing was just the way I like it, the characters developed so much, and the ending was spectacular. Ridge, Sydney, and even Maggie are some of my favorite characters to date and they all grew so much. In the novel when Ridge accepts that he has feelings for two completely different girls and how his heart was split in two, I felt the same way. Ridge himself is seriously my dream guy. Hes so romantic and thoughtful. Not only his he a great friend, hes just an overall great person who puts so many people before himself. There were so many scenes where I completely loved the dynamic of each relationship. Throughout the story, the characters grow so much and I found it amazing how authentic the story was! There are definitely some life lessons that can be taken out of this novel. The twists in this book are priceless. There is something revealed only about 50 to 75 pages in that I was blown away about. I never saw it coming, and it added a lot more depth and intrigue into the novel. Once I read that, I was so much more excited to see how things would work out. The plot is filled with nonstop action that left me breathless. There are so many reveals and heated moments that I never wanted to put this book down. The dynamics between Ridge and Sydney were amazing; there are so many scenes where they are so close to crossing the line from friendship into something more, and it kept me on my toes the whole entire time. Let me just say this: the scene with the pen at Sydneys new apartment killed me. Youll understand if you have read the book, and if you havent, you have so much to look forward to. Im pretty much speechless over this book. Theres is nothing that really irritated me, expect for how much Sydney cried. That one tiny thing is all I can complain about, and the rest is perfection. Maybe Someday is by far the most upbeat, fun, and happy novels out of the ones I have read by Colleen Hoover. There are devastating reveals, but this work is definitely the lightest out of all of them. This book did so many things to my emotions and I loved it so pieces. Even if you havent liked Colleens other works, you must check this one out. Seriously, Im fangirling so hard on this book right now because it is a masterpiece. I adore it! Overall, this novel was amazing! I see why people recommend Maybe Someday as the first Colleen Hoover book to read, but Im happy that I read some others before I picked this one up. The music aspect was amazing and really drew me into the story. I loved the plot and the idea that you could be in love with two people at the same time. I think if I were to compare this to the rest of Hoovers books, this would be my favorite with Hopeless and Confess tied for second and Slammed coming in last. Ive loved all of Hoovera works before and she has definitely become an auto buy and auto read author of mine!! This novel was near perfect for me and solidified Hoover has one of my favorite authors. A must read for anyone who is a fan or young adult or new adult!! With that, I give this book 4.9 out of 5 Stars! P.S. Sorry for such the ranty I love this book so much OMG type of review I did. I dont think I can actually put together a review capable of explaining how much I loved this book and I kind of just wrote anything that came to mind. Haha! Whats your favorite Colleen Hoover book? Or new adult novel for that matter?  Genni from Ready, Set, Read! You can also check this review and others here at my blog.
Listen. This book is devastating. Devastating. If you, like me, have been told for a few years now that its the most important thing written about American society so far this century, and you nod, and say, yeah, Im sure, but still dont get around to reading it: Stop. Read it. Go get a copy now and start. This is the next book on your reading list. Michelle Alexander lays out with brutal clarity the efficiency and durability of the system of mass incarceration that has resulted in astonishing numbers of people being under the official control of the state. This massive collection of people has limited access to all of the things essential to survival: housing, employment, government benefits, education, and, lest they try to change any of the foregoing, voting rights. With statistics, anecdotes and details that will make your eyes bleed with fury, she reviews every aspect of the system, each of which functions along racial lines: perceptions of drug offenders, profiling by police, getting out on bail, access to representation, charges levied by the prosecutor, sentencing laws, and more. Chapter 3, in which Alexander discusses the legal dead ends that have been created by the Supreme Court from every possible angle, will make you speechless with anger. Look up City of Los Angeles v. Lyons for one example. All of this demonstrates the flexibility and endurance of white supremacy in America; not surprising given that it was the original foundation of our economic system. This ability of white supremacy to be creative and adaptive is best exemplified in Alexanders discussion of colorblindness. Colorblindess, or not seeing or considering race, is something most Americans consider a good thing, something to strive for in the wake of a Civil Rights Movement that was up against overt racial hostility. But that colorblindess is what enables the system of mass incarcerationwhere the state has been able to exert total deathgrip control over so many individual lives and whole communities to go largely unnoticed by liberals and libertarians alike. And even apparent signs of racial progress, such as a more diverse appearance to universities and corporate leadership, and even the astonishing fact of a Black president, contribute to this: the carefully engineered appearance of great racial progress strengthens the colorblind public consensus that personal and cultural traits, not structural arrangements, are largely responsible for the fact that the majority of young black men in urban areas across the United States are currently under the control of the criminal justice system or branded as felons for life....A widespread belief that a majority of black and brown men unfortunately belong in jail is completely compatible with the new American creed of colorblindness, provided that their imprisonment can be interpreted as their own fault. 234235 The gains of the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s and 70s were used to put mass incarceration in motion. The ashes of Jim Crow fertilized the soil for its offspring. A lot of this could be really discouraging and depressing. As Alexander points out, there are no easy fixes. There is no lawsuit that can overturn all this, no amount of police body cams that can uproot the caste system. Its so comprehensive and powerful. It is easy to feel hopeless and defeated contemplating it. BUT. She mentions throughout the book that the only real solution is a mass movement that is capable of transforming the public consensus. A mass movement that demands not only an end to racial bigotry, but forces us all to see African Americans as equally human and deserving of love and compassion and dignity. And those of us reading this in 2016 instead of 2010 get to read her prophecies and admonition with the knowledge that such a movement now exists. As she says in her final chapter, Those who believe that advocacy challenging mass incarceration can be successful without overturning the public consensus that gave rise to it are engaged in fanciful thinking, a form of denial. Isolated victories can be won  even a string of victories  but in the absence of a fundamental shift in public consciousness, the system as a whole will remain intact. THIS is why Black Lives Matter is one of the most important movements of our generation. This movement is doing it. With a complete lack of apology, and utter insistence on their agenda. Ive been crushing on BLM for a while, but Alexanders book has ratcheted that up to adoration. People. Those moments in history that are talked about 50 years later, that give us a new collection of street names and cultural references? Thats what were in right now. The presence of this movement transforms this book from being overwhelmingly discouraging to feeling injected with hope. Its happening. NOW. It is a new public consensus that will allow mass incarceration to die and stay dead. The final chapter of The New Jim Crow is the most challenging. Thats where Alexander makes it clear that the racial caste system cannot be changed without total structural overhaul. But the final chapter also made clear to me that we have to look beyond the end of racial caste as well. The powerful call for structural revolution in her final chapter points to another, equally fundamental structural barrier: the nature of our globalized, capitalistic economy. The fact of the matter is, our society now has an abundance of surplus humans. Between automation and outsourcing, American capital simply does not need as many people as it used to in order to thrive. Mass incarceration as a system of racial control would not have made sense 200 or 100 years ago, when Black labor was critical to powering the economic machine. And our current economic structure dictates that in order to live, you must be able to contribute to the production of material goods for consumption. It doesnt matter that we have produced all matter of material goods that are well beyond any persons reasonable definition of necessities. YOU MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THE INFINITE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL FOR THE OWNING CLASS. This is the condition upon which we are all permitted to live. So if we end up with more people than we need in order to accomplish that goal? Or if the role you could have played can instead be performed by a machine, or by a person in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico or Dhaka, Bangladesh? Your life is superfluous. Maybe we should be grateful we got mass incarceration instead of genocide. Capitalism has not hesitated to adopt such measures in the past. All of this underscores that our attempts to overthrow racial caste MUST BE paired with demands for a complete restructuring of our economic order. And that restructuring has to have a global vision. Like Alexander says, When the system of mass incarceration collapses and if history is any guide, it will, historians will undoubtedly look back and marvel that such an extraordinarily comprehensive system of racialized social control existed in the United States. 170 She is right that mass incarceration will end; our racial caste system has perpetually adapted itself to both loud cultural demands though not without a battle, and just as much to subtle economic demands usually as quietly as possible. But if mass incarceration ended tomorrow, we would have more people than our current economic system can absorb, and SOMETHING will be done to achieve the equilibrium capitalism depends upon for growth. The history of the United States makes it clear that that something will ALWAYS happen to African Americans first and foremost. So we must not only learn to show love, care, compassion, and concern across racial lines, as Alexander insists, but also create an economy where the vast majority of us will not be in a position of weakness and on the precipice of scarcity, a situation vulnerable to exploitation by the white elites to establish the next racial caste system and ensure their preeminence. I better stop myself there. I could go on way too long. Its that kind of a book.
This review was originally posted on Addicted To Romance Summary Carissa Teodora always dreamed of falling in love, getting married and being a mother and living a HEA. But her world has turned upside down. The man she loved cheated on her multiple times, and they got divorced while she was still pregnant. Her ex pays hardly any child support, and as he is a lawyer and comes from a family of attourneys, she was forced to only have half custody of her son. Carissa works hard to support themselves on very little. But she will do anything for her little boy. But then her life turns around when she gets a flat tire, and a biker comes and helps her out. He seems familiar but she cant pinpoint on where she knows him from. As Carissa learns more about Joker she only finds herself more intrigued. Especially when he starts to pursue her with the Chaos Motorcyle Club pitching in to help her out. But Carissa isnt used to anyone helping her out, and tries to give back what she can while trying to learn Joker and the relationship they have. But will Carissa be able to handle the truth about Jokers true identity and be the woman he needs? The Hero Carson Steele, may be a bad boy and a loner but is truly a miracle when you see who he truly is and the life he came from. Carsons mother abandoned him when he was just a baby, and his father was cruel, beat him often and practically treated him like a slave. Carson was never considered one of the popular kids in school, but there was one girl by the name of Carissa, he fell in love with. Because she saw him as a person and not the social outcast. He always wanted her but knew he could never have her. As soon as he could, he left him hometown and searched for his own happiness in the Chaos MC. He found a brotherhood, a home and a place where he truly belonged. Now Joker was such a fantastic hero. He is blunt, charismatic, charming at times but one hell of a alpha male. He takes care of his own. But he also has vulnerabilities which I found so charming. Joker is a hero that has gone through hell and back and come out on top and doesnt even realize it. The Heroine Carissa Teodora, grew up in a loving home. Her mother died of cancer when she was a teenager, and her sister was killed in a brutal accident when they were kids. Carissa only wanted a family and a home to love. She never dreamed that the man she thought she loved, would betray her, use her and pull out all the stops. Carissa is willing to fight with every breath for her son who is still a baby. But she knows that she may lose him for good if her ex has his way. When she discovers Joker and the Choas Club, her life alters in a way she doesnt expect. Carissa is hardworking, sweet and bubbly. She has her own way of doing things. Carissa was quite refreshing, and I loved her from the beginning. She stands her ground on certain things which I loved especially when it came to Joker. What the fuck are you doin? he asked... Thats twenty cents, I returned. Huh? he grunted. Regular curse words are a nickel, I told him. Bad curse words are a dime. Everyone knows the fword is a bad one and since, starting now, youre paying me every time you curse, thats twenty cents you owe me... Ill give it to charity or something. The way you cuss, well probably be able to build a homeless shelter in a week. I liked the way she brings a freshness to the series I wasnt expecting. Her personality is so open and loveable. Plot and Story Line In Ride Steady, I was blown away by how much I adored this book. I mean truly and honestly, this might be my favorite book of the series. I cant express enough how much I loved this book and seeing these colorful characters from the Chaos MC. I will say that I think Kristen Ashley has written one of the best MC romance series ever!! And that was what it was all about. The meaning of life. Why every person on the planet was there. They got what they gave and then they gave what they got, and it was the measure of you if you could endure the shit that came with life and still find it in you to focus on the good and put that out there. I can never get enough of her, and she did a fantastic job with Ride Steady. And As a plus we see the workings of the club, and seeing more involvement of their enemy that adds a wrinkle into the plot which I truly liked seeing. We also get an introduction into some new characters that I believe are connected to her other series she has been working on so that makes me super excited. I also loved seeing the various relationship we see in this book. I loved the way this author pulls me in emotionally with the connection between these characters and boy were they fun. When I closed the door and turned to the guys, I saw they were all leaned slightly to the right, heads tipped, eyes on my behind or, in the case of the lanky guy, my legs. I felt warmth hit my cheeks and called, Is Joker around? They all came to and looked to my face. She brought him pie, the lanky guy muttered. Fuckin brilliant, the greasy jeans guy also was muttering. Does Joker even like pie? the coverall guy was only slightly muttering. But my heart squeezed. Didnt he like pie? Didnt everyone like pie? Oh no! What if he didnt like pie? Does Joker like anything? greasy jeans guy asked. I bet, today, hes gonna like butterflies, lanky guy noted. Today, I like butterflies, greasy jeans guy declared. The story sets off with getting a flashback to the past, when Carissa and Carson Joker first meet and seeing Carsons childhood. Which isnt pretty at all. He goes through some rough times, and my heart ached for this little boy who grew up into an honest and hardworking man despite his horrible upbringing. Now Carissa had a whole different childhood. She suffered pain, but in a different way. She has lost most of her family except her father, and was betrayed and set aside by the man she gave her whole life to. I loved her inner strength. She has a heart of gold, and hasnt become bitter over what has happened, just keeps fighting for the life she knows she deserves. There are secrets that Joker holds back from Carissa, since she doesnt recognize him at all. He plans on keeping it that way. We see these two form a relationship with each other, start to learn each other and they go through some ups and downs. Ive loved her since high school, man. She means everything to me. You gotta drag her down, thatll suck, but Ill pick her back up. You gotta rip her apart, Ill fuckin hate watchin it, but Ill put her back together. But we also see how much they need each other, and the romance that forms is so tender yet passionate. I kept wanting more and more of these two, because wowthey are an awesome couple together. They just FIT so well together and I loved seeing that balance. The Cover What a cover!!! I love the blue and gold tones of it, Overall View Ride Steady is a truly magnificent romance that will take you on a joy ride in the sunset. It reveals the truth tests of life and love and fighting for what matters most!! A SEXY AND TOUCHING ROMANCE!! Yeah, Carrie, he answered. Its you. Its always been you. Itll always be you. Fuckin always. foogallery id20446
Rick Yancey has written yet another mindboggling, crazy, amazing novel that has terrified me and fascinated me at the same time The Infinite Sea is the second novel to The Fifth Wave. I gave it a 4.6 out of 5 stars! I absolutely loved it. Now compared to the first book, this book is a little less action packed and its definitely a lot shorter than the first, but nevertheless, its perfectly paced, captivating, and just as thoughtprovoking as the first. In this book we delve into our secondary characters which I absolutely loved and enjoyed. We find out about Evans fate. We get introduced to new and awesome characters. And of course Yancey uses his amazing writing style to takes us on a twisting and turning ride that makes us question everything weve been told. SPOILERS DOWN BELOW!! I honestly dont know where to start... So after the prologue the story starts out in Ringers point of view which I was pretty surprised by, but I actually ended up liking her perspective a lot. I think Ringer has become my favorite character, but I still love Cassie. Anyways, I really loved how we got Ringers POV. She was just a secondary character whose perspective we hadnt really seen in the first book, but in this book she was flipping amazing! She has so much anger and rage and shes a fighter and I liked her. In her chapter she said, I am more than the sum of my fears. And I really loved that. OH MY GOSH! CAN I JUST POINT SOMETHING OUT. When I was reading the fifth wave there was this section where Ringer talked about how she felt like the sniper or bullet was connected to her which I mentioned briefly in my previous review and it sounded exactly how the silencer from the beginning of the book talked like. Initially i didnt think much of it, only that I was suspicious. Maybe, ringer isnt trustworthy. But.... IT WAS FORESHADOW! OH MY GOSH. I cant believe I caught a detail like that. Im usually so oblivious. To be honest, I like Ringer 2.0. I would love to have those enhancements. Anyways, following Ringers POV was probably my favorite section especially the second part. All the stories Vosch told her and the confuzzling questions that baffled me... All of it was amazingly written. Speaking of Voschs stories... This is crazy! Evan isnt an alien?? They just manipulated all of these humans into thinking they had alien life forms inside of them? What on earth?!?!?! Mind blown. Vosch is definitely an interesting character. I really liked the analogy with the rats being us and earth being their new home. So the aliens want to live on earth? Is Vosch human? Are the aliens actually here? Are there even aliens? Is this some sort of mirage? I dont know what is going on! Why do the aliens hate us so much? Was this question ever answered? Why not take us out with a big or small rock? Do they need us? Are they planning on enhancing the strongest humans and make them reproduce so that regular humans arent eating up earths resources anymore? The theories are endless... We learn the fate of Evan Walker! Hes alive! Crippled... but still alive!! Evan is still Evan. Snarky and adorable and flirty and cute and funny. We really dont get that much of him in this book though. Well at least not as much as I expected or as much as Id like. He and Cassie are still the cutest. That scene when they were taking that vialbomb out of the Megans throat: Hilarious! Then he plans to get himself blown up... again... When they reunited at the end I kind of cried... Because I mean.. How could I not? The way it was written was beautiful and Cassie thought he was dead and it was so dramatic in my head. The tears of joy though... Oh also in Evans POV, were introduced to this new character called Grace. Obviously at first I didnt like her because she was all,Touch me Evan and I was all like... But Graces character was pretty interesting. She was like the totally cocky, expected, seductive villian thats usually in a lot of books. I did like the history of her and Evan being told. The showdown between her and Cassie was extremely hilarious! It was interesting to see how they found each other and how they knew that they both were what they were. Im pretty sure Grace is dead, right? I mean she has to be... She was too close to Poundcake. Poundcake!!! Nooo. So like I said, we really did get into the history of our secondary characters a lot in this book. It was so sad to hear about Ringer and Poundcakes pasts...Its so heartbreaking to think about how their last memory of their parents was them being diseased and ridiculing them... This is why Poundcake never talked. It so horrifying to read about how he was shot so many times, but he still kept getting up. He still kept fighting while Grace was being all cocky doing her strutting up and down with her rifle. Then when she saw that Poundcake had the plastic bag, her cocky smile dropped like a hot potato. HA! Made me laugh.  Howd you guys feel about Razor? I was so very conflicted. When he kissed her, I was just shocked. My thoughts immediately jumped to Ben Parish. I was so confuzzled because I liked Razor. But I also liked Ben Parish. The funny thing was, the minute I admitted that I liked Razor, the truth about him deceiving Ringer was revealed... When Ringer knocked him out with the rifle, the truth hit me... Sadness... Despair... Ugh. But then its revealed that he actually does like Ringer and they have some sexy times... Wasnt sure how I felt about that, but the writing was done beautifully. Then he does something that I was so... I mean I understand why he did what he did. Ringer wouldnt run so long as Vosch had Teacup. She wouldve been a spy, a toy that Vosch would use to kill all of her friends if Razor hadnt killed Teacup. But in doing so, he got himself killed. My heart kind of broke as I imagined it in my head. One part I thought was really interesting was when Ben Parish was contemplating killing Megan because she had the bomb in her throat and Cassie was totally appalled. It was so sad to think about how these few remaining people have been stripped of their humanity. Their survival instincts are in play. Survival of the Fittest. The Best Man Wins. Do What it Takes to Survive. These aliensothers are stripping them bare and its heartbreaking. But at the same time, theyre still resisting. Theyre still fighting for their strip of humanity. For their hope. So my thoughts are all scattered so I really cant think of anything else to say. I know I rated The Fifth Wave four stars, but that doesnt mean I liked this book more than the other. I think Im going to update my rating system because its like all over the place. Oh and sorry, I think I had a little too much fun putting GIFs into my review for the first time, haha. I really cant wait until the third book!! Happy reading :
Oh dear God that was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! I freaking loved this book!!!!!!! Theme song link you can listen when you read my review!! LOL!!  Holy Hell!! What a story!! I didnt think it could get better than Stars  Stripes, but it just did!!! Another incredible book Abi!!! WOW!!! I dont know if I could say it was my favorite of the series because of all of the turmoil going on for the boys. This was a much more emotional story though, with lots and lots of soul bearing, heart crushing, injury causing, hateful words and feelings of betrayal getting thrown around. It was also intense. No I mean INTENSE. The action alone in this book...which took up the majority of the story, was just incredible!!!! I absolutely loved the storyline, as crazy and confusing as it was. The suspense was riveting!!! The story starts out back in Baltimore with our boys working together, living together and loving each other in the closest thing to contentment that either of them had ever felt before. In fact, some rather major questions were about to be raised about their future together when out of the blue they receive a phone call from none other than Nick OFlaherty, Tys Marine Recon team partner and best friend. Nick is calling from New Orleans, where he says hes been arrested and is being set up as a murder suspect. He pleads his innocence, but says that hes going to need Tys help immediately before things get too heated in the case. Ty immediately suspects a hoax, but he cant take that chance, not with his best friend. So Ty and Zane drop what they are doing, and jump on the first plane to New Orleans, knowing that Tys previous undercover work there could put his life in danger. Its a risk he figures hes just going to have to take. This is Nick were talking about. Now I cant go into detail about what happens when they arrive, but just know that it is wasnt what I would have guessed. And in pure Ty  Zane style the action just takes off from there like gasoline on a firecracker!!!! Will my boys ever catch a break...I think NOT!!! JEEEEZUSSS!!!! The time they spend in New Orleans will literally change the course of their lives forever!!! If not end them all together. And even if they survive, will their relationship?? These are the types of questions this book provokes. And the rollercoaster ride is FUCKING SCARY AS HELL!!! LOTS OF SECRETS REVEALED!!!! These are NOT les bon temps for my boys, and it brings me chest pain and tears just to recall it!!!!! And there are some very interesting plays of fate and circumstance that had me shocked and awed. There was also some very dark hoodoo going on too. And we all know how superstitious our Ty can be. image error Zane shook his head. Hed never realized it was possible for a heart to break for so many reasons at the same time. You didnt want to hurt me? Well you failed that mission miserably. Thats really the only thing you care about, right? Mission accomplished?  You shouldnt go anywhere alone. Zane turned and kicked the closest empty chair, sending it clattering to the floor. Ive always been alone! he shouted.  Do I really know you? Do I know Ty Grady at all? Ty studied him, trying to parse the anger and pain into something that didnt feel like he was dying. Zane was still sitting at the bar, his eyes dark and wounded, his shoulders slumped. One chance. That was all Zane was willing to give, even if it broke them both. Ty shook his head and started back up the steps, speaking in a low voice as he went. If you have to ask that, I guess not.  Youre asking us to think like Ty? Owen snorted. I dont think thats possible; my brain isnt powered by squirrels on treadmills.  Zane was at the door before the smoke even cleared, kicking it off its destroyed hinges. Youre welcome! Liam called after him. Good lord, to watch him youd think Ty gave reward blowjobs for being rescued.  Keeping her around would be like trying to keep a raccoon in a cage. Youll end up bloody. With rabies.  Im an assassin, Ty said, his voice unsteady. Im a killer. Im the tip of a spear. The hair on Zanes arms rose. His stomach tumbled. Another tear followed the trail of the first down Tys dirty face, but Ty didnt seem to notice. And you, Ty continued, his voice breaking. Youre a phoenix, Zane. Rising from the ashes. And all I do is make you burn. There were also a few additional characters that came out in this story. Some very intriguing characters, some very easy to hate characters too!! There was still a good bit of humor thrown into the action, but for the most part, I found this to be a much more serious and soul shattering story. The story is told from both Ty and Zanes POV, so you do get some good insight into what they are feeling, which could be both enlightening and heart wrenching at the same time. But I still love that she tells it that way. Ty propped himself on his elbow and looked down at Zane, eyes narrowed. He seemed concerned. Did you fuck me the first time because I reminded you of some random in a bar? Sort of, Zane muttered. Did you fuck me the first time because I had a gun? Yes. Ty leaned over and kissed him, then slid his leg between Zanes, shifting his weight just enough to be on top of Zane again. You had a gun. And knives. Thats a better reason than yours. There were so many ways this story could have ended. I already knew there was going to be some sort of cliffhanger ending, so I kept trying to figure out what it was going to be. But holy hell was I WRONG in my predictions!!!! What am I supposed to do with that ending?????? HOW THE FUCK AM I GOING TO LAST ANOTHER 10 MONTHS FOR THE NEXT BOOK??????? Im going to need to be put on some sort of medication....oh woes me!! Zane leaned toward him, putting his lips to Tys ear. I think Ill stick with Bulldog. Ty turned his head to capture a quick kiss. Oh, stop, Nick drawled. Im going into a diabetic coma over here. I find myself fascinated by it, Kelly said as he stared at Ty. I cant even come up with an appropriate comparison. I think that is about all I can say for now. The many many amazing quotes in this book would take me forever to try to capture!!! Abigail Roux is a brilliant writer!!!!! She has truly brought these characters to life for me to almost a pathological level!!. I am and will forever be a Ty and Zane FANGIRL. And I dont care who knows it!!! 5 AMAZING SOUL SHATTERING STARS My pics... B. Tyler Grady image error Zane Garrett image error
THIS BOOK IS PSYCHOTIC!!! I MEAN IT IS INHUMANLY GOOD. I had finished this book at 8:35 pm after staying up most of the night to read a good chunk of it and falling asleep at 9 am. I really dont know where to begin. I think the characters are the soul of this book and I will talk about them individually but I do want to answer whether it is important to have read the Grisha trilogy or not before this book. The answer is no. However because I did read the trilogy before, I was able to recognize some of the people mentioned from that series and I felt that I had more empathy about the plight of the Grisha especially knowing what happened to Ravka in that trilogy. I also wanted to mention that I listened to this book up to chapter 27 in audiobook form only because I was away from home therefore I was without the actual book and I needed to read it for my buddy read. Once I returned home I did read the book from the beginning again but I wanted to say that the voice acting for all of the characters was amazing. Especially Matthias and Kazs voice actors. BRAVO, GENTLEMEN, BRAVO. They are so good that I am going to listen to the end of this book once more time even though Ive just finished the physical book. Alright onto the stars of the show in order of favourites: 6. Wylan His character was the only one I didnt connect to very much and I think this is because we didnt have any chapters from his point of view. I basically knew him from other peoples perception of him aka. Jesper mostly and so I feel like he comes across as a sidekick instead of a hero. I did find it nice to have some of his naivete in amongst this den of vipers and thieves. It was refreshing. He is also the only character that I felt acted the age that he was in this whole book. I believed he was a teenager caught up in something way over his head and that at least made me care for his well being. 5. JesperOkay our first flawed character but the funniest. I was always laughing out loud whenever Jesper was on the scene. He is that comic relief that is definitely needed in this group but I love that he is able to get serious sometimes. I liked that as his chapters go on there is more introspection about what he is doing with his life and who he is. Sometimes his sections read like a YA contemporary expect with side commentary about shooting and killing people. I love Jesper. 4. InejShe is a big player in the underworld of the Barrel. All of her chapters had a lot of observations about many characters but mostly Kaz. She did do some self reflection near the end which I appreciated and she started to feel less like a machine to me at that point. She is also referred to as The Wraith and in her beginning chapters, I felt that was a perfect description of her. She was there in her chapters but not really. Like a breeze passing through a room or a fly on the wall which matched her skill set of spy in the book. I also loved that her body was a living weapon and listening to her talk her body through some of the most crazy stunts in this book was awe inspiring. To watch Inej pull off half the shit she does in this book alone warrants making this book into a movie. 3. Nina Now I am the first to admit that I did not like Nina in the beginning. She seemed pretty forgettable but she quickly grew on me and the more I learned about her the more I rooted for her. I love that she is so loyal to this crew but even more I love her loyalty to Ravka. This ties in with my point about reading the Grisha trilogy. Nina is a byproduct of that civil war and her actions stem from the fact that Ravka is unstable. Her patriotism to her country warms me. It fills me with happiness knowing that after all that Alina suffered through; after all the lives that she had saved, there are still those working tirelessly to make Ravka safe and strong. I also loved how unapologetic Nina is and how in the end she is the knight in shining armour. A true hero and solider. This girl is a BAWSE!!! 2. Matthias Oh man this dude is so badass. Chapter 7 is when we meet Matthias for the first time and what an impression this guy makes. Ive read that part twice in the physical book and twice on audio. I love the voice actor for Matthias. His voice is low, sexy and DANGEROUS!!  fans myself  Anyways what I love about Matthias is that he is the tortured solider. In love with his enemy and traitor to his country, Matthias chapters are all beautiful and scary inner thoughts and reflections that are well written and thought provoking. His heart wrenching description of Nina at the beginning of chapter 7 was GORGEOUS and CRAZY. I got the same feels there that I got reading Shatter Me. Listening to Juliettes mental instability gave me goose bumps and that exactly how I felt about Matthias diatribe. Matthias growth in dealing with his new circumstances were my favourite chapters and of course I loved how he eventually starts to talk about Nina. His struggle between right and wrong, duty and honour, friend or foe was always captured so perfectly. It was interesting because he represented the threat that all Grisha must face in this new world that Alina saved. His prejudices were incredibly powerful and very much reminded me of actual slavers in this world. I did mention at one point in my status updates that I was reminded of the accounts of slavery I read in Yaa Gyasis Homegoing. Again no disrespect in the comparison but I was shocked how Leigh managed to convey the real brutality of this kind of thinking in a book aimed at young adults. I loved Matthias. I cant wait to see him grow further. AND OF OF COURSE LAST BUT NOT LEAST......... 1. Kaz WTF Brekker   Shakes my damn head  Im actually speechless. Every time this dude steps out on the block, its a goddamn performance. Incredible. I dont know where Leigh had to go to get inspiration for this character but I dont think anyone could visit it especially at night. When we meet Kaz in chapter 2, I immediately thought I was in some kind of movie like Casino 1995. Honestly Im at a loss for words...... okay let me try using adjectives to describe him. Smart, Mysterious, Dangerous, Corrupt, Ruthless, Leader.................LEGEND. You can pick any chapter that belongs to Kaz and your in for something crazy. Its is solely after reading chapter 2 that I did not believe that any of them, but specifically Kaz , were teenagers. Kaz acts like a 25 year old man. His back story is probably something the bogeyman likes to hear before bed. It is incredible grotesque and dark. The things that he has done. The things that he did. Oh man......they DO NOT call him Dirtyhands for no reason. This book was great just based off the group and the heist but IT IS LEGENDARY because of Brekker. Enough said. This whole book was amazing however my only gripe is that the characters were not older. I kept Wylan the same age but everyone else I had to age up in my head otherwise it was just not believable enough. I had Inej at 21, Nina at 25, Jesper at 26, Kaz at 25 and Matthias at 27. I dont think it would have hurt the story to have an older cast at all. I literally cant wait to start Crooked Kingdom and I truly feel sympathy for all of you who had to actually wait the year till it came out in order to find out what happens. I would have been in a world of hurt if I had to wait.  Still shaking my head What an epic read. Speechless
Full review now posted! Original review can be found at Booknest. Some adventures being easily. It is not hard, after all, to be sucked up by a tornado or pushed through a particularly porous mirror; there is no skill involved in being swept away by a great wave or pulled down a rabbit hole. Some adventures require nothing more than a willing heart and the ability to trip over the cracks in the world. Other adventures must be committed to before they have even properly begun. How else will they know the worthy from the unworthy, if they do not require a certain amount of effort on the part of the ones who would undertake them? Some adventures are cruel, because it is the only way they know to be kind. Portal fantasy is among my favorite things, and Seanan McGuire excels at creating new realms. This book was just as good as Every Heart a Doorway, and yet managed to be completely different in tone and the method in which the story was told. This is the story of Jack and Jill, the identical twins from Every Heart a Doorway, before they were cast back through their door and relegated to Eleanor WestaEURtms Home for Wayward Children. The novella can be viewed as a prequel or a standalone story in the same series. It should most certainly be read, because it has much to say in its lessthantwohundred pages. Jaqueline and Jillian Wolcott are twin girls borne to selfish, selfabsorbed parents, who decided to reproduce merely for the attention offspring would bring them. The girls were never viewed as actual people, individuals who might have their own thoughts and dreams and desires. As someone who canaEURtmt physically have children, the quote below felt like it came from my own soul: There are people in this worldaEURgood, honest, hardworking peopleaEURwho want nothing more than to have a baby, and who try for years to conceive one without the slightest success. There are people who must see doctors in small, sterile rooms, hearing terrifying proclamations about how much it will cost to even begin hoping. There are people who must go on quests, chasing down the north wind to ask for directions to the House of the Moon, where wishes can be granted, if the hour is right and the need is great enough. There are people who will try, and try, and try, and receive nothing for their efforts but a broken heart. And then there are these douchebags, who decide they want to reproduce and bam, pregnancy! They are horrid parents, and care nothing for children they had spawned. Chester and Serena wanted living, breathing dolls, to pose as they chose so that others would admire what they had created. Serena wanted a pretty daughter to dress up, to be admired by the other women in her circle. Chester wanted a son to show off at work, a perfect miniature replica of himself. When they had two girls instead, a wrench was thrown into their plans. And, as it turned out, babies were mewling, messy things, who refused to hear reason and follow orders. This, you see, is the true danger of children: they are ambushes, each and every one of them. A person may look at someone elseaEURtms child and see only the surface, the shiny shoes or the perfect curls. They do not see the tears and the tantrums, the late nights, the sleepless hours, the worry. They do not even see the love, not really. It can be easy, when looking at children from the outside, to believe that they are things, dolls designed and programmed by their parents to behave in one manner, following one set of rules. It can be easy, when standing on the lofty shores of adulthood, not to remember that every adult was once a child, with ideas and ambitions of their own. But babies do eventual grow into children, and children are a bit more malleable; at least for a time. Instead of learning who their children were, the Wolcotts forced them each into a separate mold: one an incredibly girlygirl bedecked in lace and ribbons and taught to fear dirt and fun; one a tomboy with short hair and grassstained jeans who was taught to distain frills and stillness. There was no love here, not even the encouragement of love between the twins themselves. These girls were not taught to think for themselves; they were taught to obey, and to fulfill the roles assigned to them. They were never comfortable in their own skin. Until they stumbled upon their door. Had they been allowed to grow according to their own paths, to follow their own interests, they might have met Alice, and Peter, and Dorothy, all the children who had strayed from the path and found themselves lost in someone elseaEURtms fairyland. But fairy tales had been too bloody and violent for SerenaaEURtms tastes, and childrenaEURtms books had been too soft and whimsical for ChesteraEURtms tests, and so somehow, unbelievable as it might seem, Jaqueline and Jillian had never been exposed to the question of what might be lurking behind a door that wasnaEURtmt supposed to be there. Behind the door, the girls find the Moors, a world of barren, harsh beauty; a realm of science and monsters and brutal loveliness. Behind the door, the girls found their home. There are worlds built on rainbows and worlds built on rain. There are worlds of pure mathematics, where every number chimes like crystal as it rolls into reality. There are worlds of light and worlds of darkness, worlds of rhyme and worlds of reason, and worlds where the only thing that matters in the goodness in a heroaEURtms heart. The Moors are none of these things. The Moors exist in eternal twilight, in the pause between the lightning strike and the resurrection. They are a place of endless scientific experimentation, of monstrous beauty, and of terrible consequences. I feel like this book is so important. If Every Heart a Doorway was an ode to misfits, Down Among the Sticks and Bones was a cautionary tale, both for those who donaEURtmt fit the mold of society and the people who would try to force them to change. This book is for everyone who has ever felt stunted and trapped by the role theyaEURtmve been relegated to, and for every person who has ever been disappointed in another individual for refusing to play by the rules they have arbitrarily laid out. Everyone should be loved for who they are, and encouraged to discover who that person truly is, and parents who rage against this idea break my heart. One a lighter note, I was a huge fan of McGuire shift in storytelling format in this novella. The narrator was a character in their own right, harkening back to gothic novels of eras past in tone. We are told what to think and what to see, which is a method of storytelling that rarely works anymore, generally feeling antiquated and clunky and too demanding. But here, in this cautionary tale with its gothic setting, the narration works fabulously well. Seanan McGuire is a literary artist, and if youaEURtmve never read her work, Wayward Children is the perfect series to try. I loved this book just as much as I loved its predecessor, and IaEURtmll be eagerly awaiting Beneath the Sugar Sky.
I know. We met less than a week ago and in that time Ive done nothing but lie and cheat and betray you. I know. But if you give me a chance...all I want is to protect you. To be near you. For as long as Im able. Wolf, are you asking me to be your alpha female? Alpha female, he murmured. I sort of like that. sigh Ill be your Alpha, Wolf. I so would. AH!!!!!! So fucking awesome!!! This was the perfect followup book to Cinder. I loved it more than Cinder. It was so intense and gory and fun and actionpacked. Amaaaaaaaazing!!! This is becoming one of my favorite series. I highly recommend it to everyone. Its a MUSTREAD. In Cinder, you follow the fairytale, Cinderella. We meet Prince Kai, Queen Levana, Cinder and many more characters. And though I loved that book, it wasnt as good as this one. In Scarlet, we follow the fairytale, Red Ridinghood. It was very similar in ways, but Meyer also adds her own story to the mixwith enough gore and intensity to keep you turning the pages until your eyes pop out of their sockets. I had so much fun with this book. Ill admit, I started listening to the audio and though I loved Rebecca Soler and how she narrated the story in Cinder and this one, I think I was finding myself a little too distracted. So I broke down and got the book and boy did I read it faster, not able to read fast enough for my liking. But at times she was slow, taking her time. Which is fine, but I liked going at my pace. So then, it picked up and I couldnt put this down. First of all, I gotta say...I love these covers. LOVE them. Like seriously. Theyre gorgeous and really fit the stories. So now, we have Wolf and Scarlet. Scarlets grandmother is missing, so Scarlet sets out to find her. But along the way, she finds out a lot about herself and where she came from. Wolf is a sexy, swoony, amazing, protective alpha. And damn did I love all the time we got with him. Sure, he was secretive about his part in the missing of Grandmere, but once he came clean, he was great. He did what he had to do to protect Scarlet. At times, I wanted to strangle her, and tell her to listen to Wolf. Okay, so how can you trust someone that lied to you? Well, hell Id listen to him regardless. It beats the alternative she had. He lied to protect her. He knew how dangerous his pack was and she didnt listen. But then again, she stopped at nothing to save her grandmother as most people probably would. But even when things turned out the way they did, I felt she should just trust him. And oh dear God. The gore in this is craaaazy. I dont mind blood and gore and violence. I love it. Its realistic and I watch it all the time in movies. Hell its even in real life. But I loved how Meyer was relentless with that part...she really made me feel like there were some real attacks going on. The wolves were fierce and mean and cruel. They didnt give a shit about morals or mercy. They just attacked and ate, like the feral dogs they are. Yikes! I still enjoyed it. I did even more because of all the bloodshed. Wow, that sounds sadistic. Oh well. I loved it. So when Scarlet finally trusts Wolf, I was all excited and giddy and rooting for these two. And when he asked her to be his alpha, I was screaming in joy. Those two were so cute. I could feel their tension burning up the pages. I could feel his wolf instincts kicking in and it was sweet. Love Wolf. Hes so...dreamy sigh Then we have Cinder and Kai. Yay! I was so happy Meyer included them still in this book. Cinder grew on me. I loved her chapters. I loved that she seemed to get a little stronger and more badass. But I felt bad for her because of what Kai is having to go through. Hes with the evil wenchQueen Levana. Shes relentless and wants to become the Empress to Kais Emperor. Yeah, Kai is the Emperor and she wants to marry him. But of course she has her own motives for that. And one that Cinder had warned Kai about in the first book. But he didnt listen. And now hes screwed. Stuck with this horrible witch. And shes brainwashing him to believe all that Cinder told him or pretended to be was a lie. But he realizes that theres no other way around this. If he doesnt marry Levana, there will be more bloodshed on his hands. He has to stop her from allowing the war to go onkilling innocent people when all she wants is Cinder. But Cinders missing, they cant find her. So what the hell is he to do? The next best thing, the other thing she wants. To marry her where shell become the ruler of the union and whatever. I would not wanna be in his position. However, I loved that Cinder and Scarlet are tied together. Both books were amazing. The writing, the characters, the worldbuilding, the action, the romance. I love it all. I just hope Cinder can get to Kai before he screws them all into the ground, before its too late. And I hope Wolf and Scarlet remain together in the next book and all is good with them. And they have a bunch of Wolf babies running around... Sorry, I got carried away there. So anyway, Im so glad I picked this one up. Im glad I stopped listening to the audio and got the book. I got a lot more out of it that way. I also loved Iko and Thorne as secondary characters. I couldnt help but compare Thorne to Kenji from Shatter Me. He was there for comic relief. His sarcasm and wit and charm was admirable and definitely needed for Cinder. But its what I loved about Kenji. I wonder if Im the only one that thought that? I still have that book on my mind, I guess. But I enjoyed the stories...interwoven with our beloved fairytales with great action and sweet romance. Such a fun journey. And I cant wait to get on with Cress. Im glad I gave this series a chance. I dont normally care to read about cyborgs and robots and stuff. But this one is just the right amount of awesomeness.
If you want true love, you will need to feel everything: the fear, hurt, anger, and sadness, as well as joy and bliss.  The Heart of the Fight Once upon a time I met a hypnotizing, heartwarming, and pulsepounding book by a newtome writer, J. Daniels. I dove into this book blindly as sometimes I like to live on the edge. Surprisingly, I could not decide if I loved or hated the hot and cocky hero because of the sometimes cruel and crass way he spoke to the heroine, but that quickly changed as I got to know the heart that the hero hid at first. The writing was pure magic and flowed like the tide, pushing and pulling me into these characters lives. I fell in love with this surfer boy hero, Loser, and his heroine, Legs. My love for their love story was as deep as the ocean. Hit the Spot by J. Daniels quickly rose like a huge wave to my new favorites list, as this passionate, playful, and penetrating love story will stay with me forever. Hit the Spot stole every part of me from the startmind, body, heart, and soulas it held me hard in its clutches, quickly captivating me and claiming me where I could only succumb to its spell. Butterflies fluttering. Pulse pounding. Heart beating out of my chest. Mind racing. I sank myself so deeply into Hit the Spot that I never wanted to surface for air. Like a surfer to a big wave, I wanted to take this thrilling and tender taleride it hardand see how this messiest of love stories unfolded. Jamie McCade is a gorgeous, cocky, muscular, tall, blond and blueeyed surfing god. An Adonis in and out of the water, Jamie is a playboy where women are like waves, fast and flowing. The one woman who crashed into Jamies life many months ago, the best friend of his best friends woman, wont leave his mind or his heart. Beautiful, blonde, blueeyed, and longlegged Tori Rivera wants nothing to do with Jamie McCade. Jamie is crass and crude but this sexy surfer boy is pure beauty that her eyes cant help but appreciate. Tori is not going to be another notch on Jamies surfboard. Can you let go of me please? Youre feelin it, arent you? What? This shit between us. Im wearing you down, Legs. Nope. Its happening, babe. Jamie and Toris banter was enticing and entertaining. Their lethal and loving mix of hope, heat, and a little hate was my high...my drug...and I could not get enough. I loved the way Tori didnt back down to Jamie and batted that sass right back to him like a beach ball. You know the game, babe. I push and you push back, giving me your smartass mouthwhich I dig. Legs, no question there...but...I can only be patient before I stop waiting around and start takin. Your playing time is about up. I could not help but laugh hard at Jamies attempts to capture Tori and make her his. His overthetop alpha antics, sometimes mixed with douche dude moments, were pure amusement and anguish. Persistence was paying off, as Tori was powerless to Jamies alpha allure. I was powerless to this beautiful man too. Jamie tasted good. Too good. And he kissed even better. Their kisses were fire that made them burn. The chemistry and passion between Jamie and Tori was offthecharts hot, so explosive that I felt their passion penetrate through the pages to me. You give it up, Legs, dont matter what it is and Im keepin it. Know what it means to you and want you knowin you aint alone in that. I feel it too, babe. Oh did I feel this love story...I FELT ALL OF THE FEELS...I FELT EVERYTHING!!! Jamie was peeling Toris layers off, one by one, and slowly seeping into her heart. This beautiful surfer, with a side of soft, had my heart. I surrendered it to him and I likely will never get it back. That fire was spreading through me, and I wanted it. I wanted to burn. Tori didnt want fall under Jamies spell, but his beautiful looks, alpha attitude, and huge heart made it difficult to ignore him and continue fighting the intense chemistry and love building between them. She looked like she wanted me to catch her. I would. She just needed to ask. I swooned and never stopped swooning until the end. Hit the Spot is swoon in spades. Words of passion and promise kissed me where I felt butterflies dancing in my belly, a feeling of hope, happiness, and heart. God. What was more dangerous? The heartbreaker or the breathstealer. Player Jamie or the man who let me touch him like he was mine. I didnt know. Hit the Spot is messy love at its finest, and oh did I love this roller coaster of a romance! This story was a hot mess of a fight to the finish line of love in the most perfect of imperfect stories! This tormented tale with its lovehate mix was electrifying...a furious rush. Hit the Spot by J. Daniels was my rush, my roller coaster ride of angst and my firestorm of feels. Youre way past likin me. I hit your soft spot and Im fkin staying there. Oh did Jamie make me swoon and smolder. That surfer boy hero? He...Jamie...was my hero at the end. This man is PURE PERFECTION. I was owned by Jamie. I was OWNED by Hit the Spot. THIS STORY IS EVERYTHING!!! I was on fire reading Hit the Spot as the dialogue ignited me from head to toe. The mix of love and hate, and the push and pull of the clashing characters were a furious rush that was electrifying and enthralling. This complicated love story full of chaos challenged me to fall in love. Not long into Hit the Spot, I fell...HARD! GAME OVER. I was GONE! Hit the Spot is intoxicating and invigorating, a perfectly imperfect love story that bleeds angst and crashes into the heart like a hurricane, as it hits all the right spots. The anguishfilled romance, Hit the Spot, was my addiction...my ache...my ALL! I burnt for this angst that ate me up as I ate it too. I laughed, cried, smiled, and swooned as I could not help but feel every emotion that exploded like a tsunami. I FELT ALL OF THE FEELS. I LOVED THIS STORY SO MUCH! Hit the Spot hit my heart hard, hitting the spot indeed...that soft one. hit the soft spot stars
This review includes slight spoilers... and its really long! For a nonspoilers review, click here! My crew? Let me tell you whats going to become of my crew when this is over. He ticked off on his fingers. Cinder will be the ruling monarch of a big rock in the sky. Iko will go wherever Cinder goes, so lets assume she becomes the queens hairdresser or something. You  are you a part of the crew now? Doesnt matter, we both know where youre going to end up. And once we get Scarlet back, she and Wolf are going to retire to some farm in France and have a litter of baby wolf cubs. Thats whats going to become of my crew when this is done. It sounds like youve put some thought into this. Maybe, said Thorne, with a oneshoulder shrug. Theyre the first crew Ive ever had, and most of them even call me Captain. Im going to miss them. Thank the stars for The Lunar Chronicles, this is one of my favorite book series! I easily fell in love with this series after bingereading all of the books before Winters release. The story within the series is brilliant, and Winters story is no different from the past books because its equally amazing. This book took the story we love to new levels and it felt incredibly fresh. Its really long, and there were a couple of scenes that I felt were unnecessary to the progression of the book. Its hard to wrap up so many characters individual story lines though, and I think thats exactly why it had to be the length that is is. Some would argue that certain scenes felt too busy when all of our characters were together, but these were some of my favorite parts! I helped, said Thorne. He held the lamp, Iko clarified. Jacin did nothing, said Thorne, pointing. Jacin checked your pulse and breathing and made sure you werent dead, said Iko. Thorne snorted. I could have done that. The gang is back ladies and gentlemen! Everyone we love is here, and honestly I thought each character got just the right amount of scenes they deserved. Cinder has always been the heart of this series, and that is made clear in Winter. Every character is still amazing, and I love how each of them have these flaws but end up becoming these heroes despite all of their faults. My favorite part of this series is the relationships between these characters. So, lets talk about a few of my favorites!! Honestly, I guess it was the only thing I had to connect me to you when I thought Id never see you again. Cinder and Kai have been the real OTP of my heart since the first book. I know a lot of people think they are boring, but I just love them  and it was nice to finally see them together after being apart for so long. Though Cinder and Kai are my favorite couple.. Cinder and Thorne are my two favorite characters along with their relationship, what a friendship! It was nice to see how much theyve grown together. But... not to be just another girl, she said. I never wanted to be just another one of your girls. The smile vanished again. Cress. . . CRESS AND THORNE!! I have enjoyed reading their sweet romance, and you want to know why? It was so naturally formed that there was no way you couldnt fall in love with their love. I actually enjoyed reading about Winter and Jacins relationship. I didnt think I would enjoy it as much as I did, but it was sweet. Although, a part of me enjoyed Jacin a little more as an individual character but overall I liked them together. Scarlet and Wolf were still as lovable as ever, too! I just enjoyed reading about these characters. Everyone got the ending that they deserved. Ill really miss these characters  they each stole a piece of my heart, and theyll always be there. She looked around, at the smiles and the arms draped over shoulders and Winter daintily licking buttercream from her fingers. At the homemade cake. A gathering of friends. A celebration, for her. They were silly things to be floored by, but she couldnt help it. Shed never had these things before. Gratitude swelled behind her sternum, and though she was still nervous  still terrified  she realized that she felt lighter than she had in days. Your Majesty? She looked up. Kinney had returned. Its time. Overall, the conclusion to this series was amazing. Sure there were things that I wish were included and parts where the story seemed to drag on, but it was such a fun emotional ride that I didnt mind these faults. Winter kept me intrigued through the brilliant storytelling by Meyer, and it was full of homage to the fans. She sure can tell a story. Marissa Meyers writing is brilliant, and it really shines in Winter. You can see how much work she has put into giving fans everything that they wanted in the end of this series. The action was amazing! Meyer painted these pictures through words where you felt like you were in a movie theater sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time! She really knows how to make us feel invested into this world and the characters within. No, little niece. You are much more like me. Willing to do anything to be admired. To be wanted. To be queen.  Can we talk about that final scene between Cinder and Levana though?! Amazing! Im in denial that this story is actually done. I mean I know we have a short story bind up to look forward to, and an epilogue with a wedding!! But still.. Ill just leave you with this final quote from Cinder as she reflected on her journey. . . Ever since she could remember, it had been a burden. A constant reminder that she was worthless, she was unimportant, she was nothing but a cyborg. She held the foot over the water and let go. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a unique take on retellings, with hints of fantasy and scifi in the mix! Oh, and to anyone whose read the past books!
After reading several awesome reviews for this book, I was really itching to get my hands on it and see what the fuss was all about. So, lets get the complaints out of the way first. The purple prose really disappointed me even though I tried not to let it because I was so looking forward to reading this. And the metaphors, good LORD, the metaphors. Every freaking page. A few is one thing, but after the first like, 20, I think my eye actually started to twitch and I found myself rolling my eyes frequently. Here are a few examples: Im wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face. Ugh. Roses, fine. But dead cotton? Really? His eyes are the perfect shade of cobalt, blue like a blossoming bruise, clear and deep and decided. Since when was a bruise a perfect shade of blue??? Sure, bruises are fun to poke, but pretty? Hardly. He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter. Uh...what? Oxymoron much? I want to bury my tears in a bucket of regret. My heart is a field of lilies blooming under a pane of glass, pitterpattering to life like a rush of raindrops. He leans back against the couch. Runs a free hand over his face. Seasons change. Stars explode. Someone is walking on the moon. Anyone else seeing that condom commercial, describing sex with random imagery? Maybe its just me. Heat rushes up my neck and I fall off a ladder holding a paintbrush dipped in red. What does that even mean? And no, she didnt literally fall with paint. He closes his eyes for half of a second and I marvel at the drop drop drops of hot water caught in his eyelashes like pearls forged from pain. His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories. And that wasnt even half. Just the really annoying ones. So distracted I was by the flowery writing, it took me a long time to get through this because I had to go back and reread paragraphs multiple times. And some of the words  like, lackadaisical ennui  WTF is that? Does anyone know? No? Didnt think so. Other irritating comparisons were the ones about the eyes: My eyes break open. 2 shattered windows filling my mouth with glass. His eyes are 2 buckets of rainwater: deep, fresh, clear. His gaze is fixed on me; 2 buckets of river water at midnight. My eyes are 2 windows cracked open by the chaos in this world. Which brings me to something else that I found irritating....the numbers instead of words. Always 2 knocks or 4 walls instead of two knocks or four walls. I dont know why, but this really bothered me. It was like Mafi refused to spell out any numbers. Despite how annoying most of the metaphors were, there were a few that I liked. Such as: My life is 4 walls of missed opportunities poured into concrete molds. 1 word, 2 lips, 3 4 5 fingers form 1 fist. 1 corner, 2 parents, 3 4 5 reasons to hide. 1 child, 2 eyes, 3 4 17 years of fear. Okay, not really a metaphor, but flowery. But still I liked it. Hope in this world bleeds out of the barrel of a gun. This one really conveys the desperate conditions of the world painted in Shatter Me. Hate looks just like everybody else until it smiles. Until it spins around and lies with lips and teeth carved into the semblance of something too passive to punch. That quote describes Warner perfectly. Hes a bad dude, that much is clear, but he treats Juliette with kindness at times. At first I had mixed feelings about him, but then I realized he just wanted power. Toward the end he became so obsessed with Juliette that it was almost sad. So strong was his obsession that he deluded himself into believing he loved her. I almost felt sorry for him. This book may have taken a little more time and effort to read to see past the flower garden of writing, but I still really liked it. There were a lot of runon sentences, incomplete sentences, missing punctuation and broken, sporadic writing, but somehow Mafi made it work. Surprisingly, it really added to Juliettes point of view. Shes been locked up in solitary for so long its a wonder she hasnt lost her mind. So the way its written gives you an idea of how she thinks. At times there was too much feeling for words mostly times with Adam that Mafi writes in feelings. Thats the only way I can describe it. Words so beautifully and randomly mashed together to create feeling that I felt what Juliette was feeling. I really felt sadness on Juliettes behalf, because all she really wanted was to be loved. Her parents didnt want her, she didnt have any friends, and she wasnt ever allowed to touch people. The general public viewed her as a freak, and kids would throw rocks at her. She has so much power but still retains her humanity. Even with the horrible way she had been treated. There were moments were I was absolutely rapt by this dystopian world. Its a future where books are destroyed, artifacts are burned, and all diverse languages are banished so one new language can be made. Different is bad. The sick and the old are locked away or discarded. Only the strong should survive. When Mafi was describing this future, I was horrified. No diversity? But thats what makes us human. What makes us who we are, what separates us from the next person. She makes it sound utterly convincing that this could come to be in the distant future. How we could let the world go and it would come to such extremes. Okay, so the whole story I had the question in my mind  Surely Juliette isnt the only anomaly? And towards the end, it was finally answered. After finishing it, I now see it was compared to XMen. When Juliette put on the purple suit and gloves, I pictured Anna Paquin with the white streak in her hair, unable to touch anybody. And the unanswered question  if Adam could touch her because he was probably special, wouldnt that make Warner special too? If you read it, what do you think? Mafi better hurry up and finish the second book. I cant wait to get my hands on the second book! This review was originally posted on Novel Heartbeat.

Wicked Designs The League of Rogues Series by Lauren Smith Overview by Amazon: The League of Rogues takes what they wantbut have they taken on too much? For too long Miss Emily Parr has been subject to the whims of her indebted uncle and the lecherous advances of his repulsive business partner. Her plan to be done with dominating men forever is simplefind herself a kind husband who will leave her to her books. It seems an easy enough plan, until she is unexpectedly abducted by an incorrigible duke who hides a wounded spirit behind flashing green eyes. Godric St. Laurent, Duke of Essex, spends countless nights at the club with his four best friends, and relishes the rakish reputation society has branded him with. He has no plans to marry anytime soonif ever. But when he kidnaps an embezzlers niece, the difficult debutantes blend of sweetness and sharp tongue make him desperate for the one thing he swears he never wanted: love. Yet as they surrender to passion, danger lurks in Godrics shadowed past, waiting for him to drop his guardand rob him of the woman he cant live without. I once read that Jane Austen never wrote a single scene with just men. The rationale was that since she had never been alone with a man or men, she didnt know what they talked about, therefore she couldnt write about it. For many women in the Georgian and Regency eras, this would have been a very true fact. Women were highly chaperoned and moved in flocks, and however unjust it was men could do as they please, where women were held to very strict and high moral expectations That is why I loved this book so much! This book was FUN! Its not often you read a historical romance novel that has all the usual elements really well done, but on top of it, the book had you smiling and laughing. Emily has been kidnapped by the League of Rogues. The kidnapping in itself was hilarious with blunders and missteps. She has been spirited away to one of the members, Godrics country estate. The purpose is to compromise her in retaliation for the business dealings Godric has with her spineless uncle Albert. They do not plan on actually doing any physical harm to her and this is not a menage type of story. Just a simple kidnap until enough damage has been done to her reputation that her uncle will suffer. What made this book so enjoyable was the time Emily spent with the five Lords. They are all very different men and exhibit a lust for life. They take Emily under their wing and spend time with her as if she were one of them. They never treat her like a sister, as they talk about things in front of her that no wellbred lady should be privy too. They all have an interest in the beautiful young lady and it was fun to watch them all have a go at wooing her. Emily is NOT happy to have been taken. Although she didnt like her current situation with her Uncle as he was plotting to give her to his horrible business partner Blankenship, she is faced with an even more challenging position as captive. Her escape attempts are so funny. She shows really ingenuity and cunning to try to defeat the League men. She pretends she cant speak Greek and eavesdrops on their plans, she pretends she cant ride and manages to outride them all, and she manages to bribe the staff to do her bidding. Each attempt was charming and I was crushed for her when she would be dragged back each time. As a reader, you know its a great book you are reading when you are so emotionally invested in the lives of the characters. I wanted Emily to stay there because the alternative was a horrible situation. I liked that they guarded her and cared for her. All the men try to woo her. One brings her a puppy although it is more for the reason that the puppy will make noise if she tries to escape, one takes her fishing, one engages in conversations about her feelings and one tries to seduce her well, they all try in some way. Godric is the reason that she has been kidnapped. Since he laid eyes on her, he has been drawn to her. He knows the other men are interested, but once she shows some interest in return, she belongs to him. The other men are still protective, but watch the courtship between to two develop, intervening when necessary. Godric is a lusty man. He desires her, but like most Lords he has a past that has given him a cold heart and a strong temper. He doesnt believe in love and marriage is out of the question. However, seduction is definitely on the agenda. He slowly wears down her defences and like a flower blooming; he slowly awakens her to the beauty of intimacy. The love scenes were so well written. Emily has her first kiss and one of the Rogues tells her she kisses with her heart, so of course it scared the pants off Godric. As time passes, Emily is happy in her situation. She enjoys the Rogues and the protection they are providing, as danger most certainly lurks. Blankenship wants Emily badly. He wants to degrade her and defile her sexually. He enlists various characters to spy and abduct Emily. She believes she must try for a final escape to save the Rogues and Godric from death by Blankenship. She doesnt succeed, but it solidifies for Godric that he cant live without her. Hes not able to choke out the love words she wants, but in his marrow he knows that he cant live without her. Eventually, Blankenships machinations get results. He is able to get Emily away from the Rogues. Godric and the League are her Knights in shining armour and save her from a dreadful fate. Emily is a smart woman. Before she will say any vows, Godric must willingly say those words that she must hear. He gladly does because he knows that she is the one. This book had all the elements of a perfect historical romance novel. The hero and heroine at odds with each other. Evil men willing to do harm to innocent ladies. A slow, burning seduction that lights up the pages with hot love scenes. But what really made this book stand out were the humour and the comradery amongst the League. It was so enjoyable to read about them whiling away the hours as gentlemen friends with a lady in tow. There were no pretensions about who they were and it wasnt as if they treated Emily as one of the guys, but rather as a partner in crime. This is a delightful read and Ive already read the next book in the series and I hope the author hurries up and writes the third book as I cant wait to learn more about these wonderful and charming Rogues and the ladies who love them.

I am writing this as a ghost because this book killed me. I, Ericas ghost, have a lot of things to say about this but feel inadequate to verbalize my loveobsessionadorationfascination with this spectacular story using coherent thought. Some other reviews somehow managed this, such as Ninas, Simonas, and Chantals. But I shall try. To begin, I would like to say that I read this for about 7 hours straight. I ignored the existence of time to fulfill my addiction to this series, which is, honestly, my favorite series Ive ever read. I cannot understand how I lived without this series and, for so long, without being a devoted reader of anything. This series embodies what truly is magical about reading. It embodies the true transformative power of a story. And embodies how a reader can fall deeply in love with fictional characters. You may be saying to yourself, ghost of Erica, youre being awfully dramatic here, it cant possibly be that good. And I would say to that: First of all, Second of all, no Im not overhyping this. The Winners Kiss was a perfect ending to a perfect series. This final installment continued with the political intrigue and overall complexity that the first two had built so well. If the author bombed after the first book, the original story would have still been great. But noooooo, she didnt stop there. She made the story absolutely fucking spectacular. Oh so often authors stretch out their series by adding unnecessary drama i.e. personal relationships or magical worlds getting in the way but Marie Rutkoski made a story where the conflicts were, however extraordinary, ultimately understandable. I did not facepalm at events. I did not roll my eyes at peoples choices. I was, at times, crushed by certain occurrences, but they were necessary events in the end. The true star here was our female protagonist, Kestrel. She was spectacular. And no, she wasnt a magical assassin or the chosen one or the lost princess who possesses a legendary power, she was a dynamic, vibrant, brave, manipulative, powerful person with flaws and misjudgments and worries. And we hardly are ever told these traits, we are able to see them ourselves. Kestrel is shown to us as a complex individual whose attributes come through in her actions and thoughts, not through direct communication from the author. You dont need to be gifted with a blade. You are your own best weapon. She is a beautifully crafted character. Her development over the series made me feel embarrassed that my original love for her in The Winners Curse was so shallow. I didnt know her then. I didnt see all she could do. But I am thankful I got to see her evolution. And shes probably off doing more badass things now even though the series ended. Ultimately, I think that this whole series has the overarching theme of the transformative power of love. And no, not like in typical YA novels where hot 17yearold girl becomes transfixed with shirtless hot 17yearold boy and they get married at the end. I mean love in all forms. The love between a father and daughter, between friends, humorous bromance, dependable allies, love that hurts but love that heals, and, lastly, romantic love. I know people often say shit like love hurts or love is a battlefield or love is pain. And I guess I could see what they mean, relationships are difficult, they take work. Sometimes really passionate yet unhealthy relationships cause you immense turmoil. Ive experienced it. BUT ultimately those people are being dumb. Love inherently does not hurt. When it is twisted in such a way, something you view as love feels bad when it is unrequited. Love is beautiful and feels good and lights your soul. Yes, it has trials, yes things hurt sometimes, but love is a force of good. It makes you a better person on your own, to be supported by a person who unconditionally loves you. This book knows that. It is full of prime examples of this love at work, in its many forms. And the love between Kestrel and Arin is that kind of love, the true kind. They grow together and feel together and move forward with each others best interests at heart. But the fucking suspense sometimes. Like I was pretty much internally begging the author to bring Kestrel and Arin together. And none of this emotion would have been possible without the brilliant writing. Marie Rutkoski is one hell of a writer. Her writing motivates me to be a better writer AND a better reader. She masterfully constructed this story. She took a story that could eventually fall flat and made it pulse with life. Her words were poetic and beautiful and symbolic and powerful without being overwhelming. And she utilized POV changes with expertise. I especially loved when in battle she shifted from Kestrels point of view to Arins at the most poignant times. It hastened the plot and created that sense of urgency one Im guessing would feel in battle. It conveyed the illusion that many, many things were happening at once and her narrative camera was keeping you on the edge of your seat. Even within simple conversations, her suggestion of pauses and reactions was brilliant. She makes the reader intelligent, because she forces you to think and become enraptured in this world. For example look at this: How do I look in the dark? Startled, Arin glanced at him. The question had had no edges. It wasnt sleek, either. Its soft, uncertain shape suggested that Roshar truly wanted to know. In the fired red shadows, his limbs looked lax and his mutilated face met Arins squarely. The heavy feeling that Arin carriedthat specific sadness, nestled just below his collar bone, like a pendantlessened. He said, Like my friend. Roshar didnt smile. When he spoke, his voice matched his expression, which was rare for him. Rarer still: his tone. Quiet and true. You do, too. Like what. How does she verbalize brilliance in this way? Im astounded. Bottom line, shes an incredible writer and Im honored that she signed my first two books in the series and that shes friends with Kristin Cashore whom I love. Theres a particular quote that I absolutely adore that I wanted to share with you all the bolding in this passage is my own: The stainedglass window glowed, and something eased open inside Kestrel. As color seeped into the room, she felt an unexpected wish. She wished her father were here. You, who seek your own fathers death. But she didnt, she found that she couldnt, no matter how he had hurt her. She wished that he could see her play, and win. That he could see what she saw now. A window is just a window. Colored glass: mere glass. But in the sun it becomes more. She would show him, and say, love should do this. And you too, she would tell him, because she could no longer deny that it remained true, in spite of everything. I love you, too. This passage made me falter when I read it. It is so beautiful . And so indicative of the overarching theme of genuine love that weaves itself throughout every aspect of this story. Viewing love as the effect sunlight has on a stained glass window is something not only visually appealing, but also breathtakingly true and pure. As I said before, love should make you glow with light. I could keep going. But I think you get the picture. You should prob hop on this magical, literary train. It was an absolutely divine pleasure to read this series. Thank you, Marie Rutkoski. 4916 addition Sooo look I met Marie Rutkoski!
I was so excited to return to the world Marie Lu created in Legend that I may or may not have completely overlooked forgotten the trouble June and Day were facing when the book ended. And when I opened Prodigy, there it was, glaring at me. Here we go again! As fastpaced and keepyouonyourtoescrazy as Legend was, Patriot was even more so. I felt like I didnt even have a second to breathe as lifealtering decisions were being made and a new facet of the war was unfolding. We didnt see much of the battle in Legend, and honestly, we still dont witness much of it in this sequel. What we do see is a war at home, a war between the people: between the Patriots and those still loyal to the Republic. And this is where June must make a choice. After the events that transpired in Legend, it is clearer than ever that Day will do whatever he can to save his younger brother and take down the Republic. But June  though she has suffered losses just like Day at the hands of the Republic  still finds it difficult to align herself with the Patriots, especially when their newest target is the new Elector, a young man she hardly knows but thinks is capable of bringing about great changes. One of the things I praised Legend for was the great characterization, how genuine the characters felt. How, even if the transitions between June and Days pointsofview hadnt been easily identifiable with the change in color and typeface or the names heading up each chapter, I still would have been able to mark the difference between each voice because each was singular to the character it represented. I think that the characters are even more themselves in Prodigy. They are no longer pretending to be other; they just are who they are. Day is damn near enthusiastic, once he learns of the Patriots plans to assassinate the young Elector. This government has taken almost everything from Day and he is ready to exact his revenge on everyone involved with it. June, on the other hand, senses something off about the Patriots leader, but try as she might to call Days attention to it and convince him that there might be another way to save his brother, she actually ends up causing him to secondguess her loyalty to the cause. And herein lies the problem: there is such a disconnect, such a lack of communication between Day and June in this novel, that I almost began to wonder if they ever truly loved each other to begin with. Day lets the disparaging words of Tess and others grow his everincreasing doubt in Junes loyalties. And it doesnt help that June has been sent back to the Republic as a doubleagent to lure the Elector into a trap. But even in the beginning of this book, it felt like something was missing between the pair. Maybe its because I read Legend over a year ago that things feel all wrong, but doesnt June rescuing Day kind of negate everything else that happened? Apparently not. But even if it did, youd better believe that Tess wont let Day forget what June did, what hand she played in the events that led up to Days capture. Theres the potential here for a love square, but thankfully, the author doesnt let the characters get all angsty on us. Okay, well, they get a little angsty, especially when June and Day start internally reflecting on how they can ever work out, being from two different socioeconomic backgrounds as they are. And the differences between their worlds, their classes, is even more glaringly obvious now than it ever was before. But their introspection is necessary to show just how much each character has grown in such a short time. June wont make the same mistakes, wont trust so easily, and Day, well, hes obviously still learning to trust June. Its a crazy world they live in, but they each just want to make it a better place for everyone and reunite the country. Its through their eyes that we start to see how the decline of North America came about in the first place. For those who complained that the worldbuilding in Legend was subpar, I think youll be fairly impressed with what the author has done in Prodigy. Not only is there a history lesson in there, courtesy of the new Elector Primo, but we get a brief glance at how the Colonies are actually faring. That in itself was shocking. What was even more shocking was the revelation made at the end of the book. I dont know if Id call it a cliffhanger, but it is definitely a gamechanger, thats for sure. I dont think I breathed for the last 60 pages or so of this book. I knew better than to expect any kind of happy ending since this is only the second book in a planned trilogy, but damn, Marie Lu really goes for the heart. I know, I know...shouldve seen it coming after what she put us through in Legend. And I suppose I did...there were subtle hints throughout the novel, but I turned a blind eye to them, in hopes that if I didnt acknowledge them, nothing bad could happen. Oh, what a fool I was. In summation: lots of trust issues, a civilization on the brink of revolution, and a bit of angsty teenage romance to round out the whole shebang. And an ending that could quite possibly leave you in tears. Possibly. But I like to remain optimistic, and if these first two novels have taught me anything, its that Marie Lu is full of surprises. Now, whether theyre the good kind or not, I cant say. But I can hope. Ill be wishing on every falling star I see for an early copy of the final book in this series so that I dont have to wait in agony for another year. Favorite Quote: Well enough, I reply. Remember, youre drunk. And happy. Youre supposed to be lusting over your escort. Try smiling a little more. Day plasters a giant artificial smile on his face. As charming as ever. Aw, come on, sweetheart. I thought I was doing a pretty good job. I got my arm around the prettiest escort on this block  how could I not be lusting over you? Dont I look like Im lusting? This is me, lusting. His lashes flutter at me. Thanks to Jen at YA Romantics for gifting me her extra ARC! This review can also be found at The StarryEyed Revue.
Review on  Expectations Ive been wanting to read this book for a long time, but also never wanted to start reading it. I know reading this will be an emotional rollercoaster and I needed to be prepared for that. I talked to another book blogger Katrina and we decided to read this together! Synopsis from Goodreads Despite the tumorshrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazels story is about to be completely rewritten. Review The first five chapters show us a great start of a very touching story. When I started reading this, I knew that I will be emotionally invested in the characters John Green describes so realistically. I immediately liked the main character Hazel a lot. She has a good sense of reality. She has a great sense of humor, which is always a plus for me. We get to see her connecting with Augustus Gus. From the moment they meet, they seem to have some kind of deeper connection. I love Gus, he really gets Hazel and he is the person she needs. He understands her fascination for the book she has read over and over and he tries to help Hazel the best way he knows how. I also liked the sidecharacters, especially Isaac. I really enjoyed reading about him and liked the moments with Isaac, Gus and Hazel a lot. The writing is so beautiful and rich. I really get the feeling that I read Hazels thoughts and get to see the way shes trying to live her life, despite of everything going on. An example of the exquisite writing: Hazels on the phone with Gus: And then the line was quiet but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone. Part of the book takes place in Amsterdam. It was fun to read about the city where I live, which made reading this more dynamic for me. I definitely was crying my eyes out near the end, but still loved reading this story. It was definitely the roller coaster ride I thought it was going to be and I felt all kind of emotions reading this. I would recommend reading this, but only if youre up for it and ready to tackle this emotional read. Its beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. 5 Questions Katrina and me both answered these five questions about the book. Check out her review and answers to these questions: review TFIOS by Katrina 1. What was your favorite part of the book? Thats a hard one, because there are a lot of great moments in this book. To name one, I loved the scene with the swing set. Gus doesnt pity her and thats exactly what she needs. He doesnt see her as a dying girl. When he looks at her, he sees a great, funny and smart girl who he cant be without. 2. Did you have a favorite character? If so, who? I would have to say I loved most of the characters. If I need to choose a favorite one, I think itl be Gus. He understands her fascinations for the book she has read over and over and he tries to help Hazel his way. I really like Gus personality. He seems to fit Hazelsperfectly. He knows the struggles because hes been through the same process. 3. Was there anything that you didnt enjoy or would change about TFIOS? Of course I wished the sad parts didnt happen, but at the same time, it because of those moments this book is such an amazing novel. Its very realistic and honest. At the end, I think changing things would take away some of the awesomeness of this novel. 4. How did you feel when the book was finished? I cried reading the end of the book. I couldnt write a review right away, which is what I normally do right after reading a book. I really needed a couple of days to process what happened. 5. If you could say anything to John Green right now, what would you say I would say that I loved reading this and the story really grabbed me and didnt let go for a while. Reading this really motivated me to read more of John Greens books and Im sure I will read more books by this author in the future! Rating I couldnt do anything else that rate this book my full 5 stars. I loved it and it gave me all kinds of feelings. I feel like theres so much I havent said about the book, but I think you got to experience those things yourself and I dont wanna spoil that for you. If you have some time and a quiet place to read and cry, go ahead an read it!
Rating: 4.5 Stars Tell Me Three Things is Buxbaums debut into Young Adult fiction but it reads like the work of a seasoned author. I would have completely overlooked this novel if it hadnt been for Majas stellar review of it, just a few weeks ago, and Im so glad I gave this volume a chance. Jessie, a junior in high school whose biggest problems in life should be preparing for her SATs, has just moved to LA. Within weeks of her mother passing away, he joined a bereavement group, fell in love, got married, and is now moving Jessie away from public school in Chicago to Wood Valley where she sticks out like a sore thumb. On the first day she arrives, though, Jessie receives a mysterious email from Somebody Nobody, an anonymous boy who helps Jessie navigate the complex hierarchies at Wood Valley. But who is SN? And why does he refuse to meet Jessie in person? Frankly, the mystery behind Somebody Nobodythough cute and extremely a la Youve Got Mailis just a tad bit predictable. But, that doesnt take away from the crux of the story whatsoever. The identity of Somebody Nobody isnt as important as his friendship with Jessie or her endless theories on who he might be. Is it Liam, the lead singer of OVille whom Dri, Jessies new friend, is majorly crushing on? Is it Caleb, Liams friend and an occasional songwriter on the band? Or it is Ethan, Jessies partner in English class and the guy she cant get out of her head? I thoroughly enjoyed watching Jessie navigate through the mystery of SN alongside her newly founded relationships with friends and acquaintances in Wood Valley. But, the best part about Tell Me Three Things is not this mystery; its merely Jessie. Jessies grief over losing her mother is present and palpable. It isnt an overbearing type of sadness that permeates the bookafter all, Jessie is doing her best to move on and acclimate to her new lifebut she cannot forget her mother, which is natural. Her stepmother, Rachel, is busy and often aloof and her stepbrother, Theo, is equally confused by the turn of events which find him with a new father and Jessie with a new mother. Thus, Jessies journey to continue forward each day, all while missing her best friend, Scarlet, from back home and yearning for her old lifeone in which her mother existedis admirable. I loved Jessies voice from the beginning and her honesty and genuine kindness are nothing short of lovely. She isnt a perfect heroine, which I love, but shes a protagonist who never gives up and learns from her mistakes to be better. Jessies relationship with her father, too, is a definite highlight. At first, she is simply shocked by his actions but, slowly, that numbness turns into anger as she demands answers. Why has her father forgotten her? Why didnt he consult her before moving her across the country? Why is he so focused on his grief that he has forgotten about hers? Its difficult to watch Jessie realize that her father is human as wellthat despite the fact that he is an adult, he absolutely does not have it all together. I think thats one of the hardest lessons every teenager learns as they grow up and Jessie comes to that realization as well, during some of the hardest moments of her life. But the progression of her relationship with her father is welltimed and realistic. I enjoyed how Tell Me Three Things didnt end with a neatly wrappedup bow when it came to Jessies new family. She is still figuring things out with her stepmother, her stepbrother, and her father but everything is going to be OK, slowly but surely. Theres a similar sense of resolution with Jessies social and academic life at school. Her new friends are supportive and immediately include her, trusting her with their secrets and sharing their opinions on sex, boys, and life in general. I give Buxbaum kudos for writing multiple sexpositive discussions that occur between Jessie and her friends, whether her new ones like Dri and Agnes in Wood Valley or her old ones like Scarlet in Chicago. I think its just as important to show young girls that its normal and healthy to talk about sex, not just be having it, and to have your own opinions about it that may differ from that of your friends. Jessies boy troubles come to a rather hilarious conclusion and though I cant say too much more without fear of spoilers, I will say that the slowburn romance and friendship at the core of this story is swoonworthy. Moreover, Jessies friendship with SN isnt merely about the romanceits about sharing their life stories and accepting that difficult things happen in life, even to young people. Tell Me Three Things is a powerful, truly memorable novel. Buxbaum writes a beautiful note at the end of the story, detailing her inspiration to write this piece and I have to say that I am immensely thankful that she wrote this. We are inundated with grief novels in YA and though they are necessary, I appreciate that Buxbaum wrote this not necessarily as a story about cycling through the seven stages of grief but rather as a novel about dealing with the aftermath of death and accepting that life doesnt stop for anyone. Jessies mourning is an important aspect of this novel, but so is her growth as a teenager, her relationships with new friends and family members, and her selfrealization about romance, her father, and so much more. Its a truly gorgeous blend of life and though this wont be a read I return to, this is going to be an author I eagerly watch out for. I hope Buxbaum is here to stay in the YA genreshe effortlessly writes nonawkward chapters consisting merely of texts, which, let me assure, is no easy taskand is a fresh voice that this genre definitely needs. Tell Me Three Things is poignant and refreshing; youll fall in love with it, I guarantee.
5 STARS for The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins! And before I get into my full review, be aware that I will be discussing major events in the book, so there will be spoilers galore here! If you havent read the book, please take my advice and get off Goodreads. Go pick up the book and read it as soon as possible. The absolute less you know about it and the characters, the better of an experience you will have. Having a lot of preconceptions and details may take away from the emotional journey and rollercoaster that is this book. Now, onto the review... If I sit in carriage D, which I usually do, and the train stops at this signal, which it almost always does, I have a perfect view into my favourite trackside house: number fifteen. This book marks my first venture into the adult fiction realm in 2015. Its not that I particularly dislike books geared towards adults, but I just find myself more attracted to the YA genre. However, since there was so much hype surrounding it Its the next Gone Girl!, Ahhh I didnt even expect the big twist at the end! I felt like I kind of had to read it. I was a little nervous to even read it because it was getting such rave reviews  nobody wants to be the buzzkill, the one person whos like welllllll.... But let me just say, TGOTT did not disappoint. The writing was beautiful, and even though Hawkins has to juggle three separate female protagonists, not once was I confused as to whos perspective I was reading from. Rachel, Anna, and Megan all had their own distinct voices, as well did the men. It was interesting to see how all these lives intertwined in one way or another, how each person was vital to the personal stories of each character. Also, Paula Hawkins is a pro at dropping little hints that lead you down one direction, and ripping the floor out from under you, so that youre constantly suspicious of each person. I mean, okay, yes, I admit that I guessed the perpetrator a little less than halfway through, but in a thriller like this, you still enjoy the road towards everyone finding out too. Ill discuss why exactly I knew it was Tom who killed Megan, but first I want to talk about how much I appreciated how the characters were written. Theres a fabulous quote written somewhere out there, about what it means to write a strong female character. Screw writing strong women. Write interesting women. Write wellrounded women. Write complicated women. Write a woman who kicks ass, write a woman who cowers in a corner. Write a woman whos desperate for a husband. Write a woman who doesnt need a man. Write women who cry, women who rant, women who are shy, women who dont take no shit, women who need validation and women who dont care what anybody thinks. THEY ARE ALL OKAY, and all those things could exist in THE SAME WOMAN. Women shouldnt be valued because we are strong, or kickass, but because we are people. So dont focus on writing characters who are strong. Write characters who are people. When someone says a strong female character, I think people get confused as to what that means. With those words, we think of Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games. We think of Tris Prior from Divergent or.. I dont know, any movie Michelle Rodriguez is in. Authors tend to get so caught up in this idea that their females need to be able to shoot arrows and fight wars in order to avoid being called a damsel in distress; that they can never show any emotion, and especially never any vulnerability. What a strong female character is, is simply a WELLWRITTEN, DYNAMIC CHARACTER. One who is not just one thing. One thats not just the cheerleader, or the drama nerd, or the crazy cat lady who lives down the street. We dont even need these girls to be kind, because kind they are not in Girl on a Train. Paula Hawkinss characters are so deliciously cruel, vindictive, and flawed. Rachel is a divorced alcoholic who drove her husband away when she fell apart, knowing she could never give him a child. Rachel cant get a job or keep one when she does have one, and is living off the kindness of her old friend. Megans a cheater who avoids issues with her husband by constant distraction and sex. She feels so powerless inside her own home, she loves the power it gives her when she seduces other men; to be the woman they wish they could leave their wives for. Theres even Anna, who is unapologetic about hooking up with a married man. She feels absolutely no guilt over it, and feels rather proud. You hate these women. You pity them. You sympathize with them. You disagree with them. YOU LIKE READING ABOUT THEM. There are so many layers to each of our three protagonists, and theyre complex. Most of these characters are horrible, horrible people who have no trouble cutting down whoever is in their path. And I love it. The same went for the men too. You meet these guys who originally seem to be caring, but once that mask falls off, you see them as who they really are. The ending, with Rachel and Anna sharing this dark secret, was haunting. Anna was probably my favourite character of this book  she was horrible, and she was even willing to let Tom murder Rachel for a few moments when it looked like she could continue on scott free. Now the ending... So it turns out Tom was having an affair with Megan, and when she threatened to tell Anna about it if Tom didnt help with their unborn child, he killed her during an argument. Tom is a psycho. An actual sociopath. Despite all of the red herrings, I did suspect it was Tom at about... 146 pages in? According to my updates. This is also a testimony to Hawkinss writing, but theres a specific part where Anna is telling Tom about spotting Rachel around Scotts house again. When she suggests getting the police involved, Tom ever so smoothly dismisses this idea. He always, always, always refused to talk to police. I also noticed that Megan had mentioned having affairs before, so I was like hmm what if they had an affair at some point? YES. I AM A GENIUS. Anyway, it was a good twist and was executed pretty well. This was a really enjoyable read, although the only parts I could complain about would be how slow it could be in the beginning. However, its not too bad and doesnt take away that much from the book itself. This is a book I would recommend to all. I expect great things from this author, considering how well this debut has done. Paula Hawkins is one to look out for.
My recaps of the show! Episode 1  The Embodiment of Stupidity Episode 2  To Survive, Be Idiots Episode 3  Everyone is Valuable, Except The Guy I Hate Episode 4  Double Standard Much? This shit is going to be a TV show? was the first thing I thought of when I turned the last page of this book. I was initially interested in 100 by Kass Morgan when I found out it was going to be adapted into a TV show on CW channel I think. I may have got this wrong, so please correct me if I got it mixed up!. As I have mentioned over and over again in my reviews, Dystopia and PostApocalyptic remain as my favourite genres ever, so its a nobrainer that I really wanted to get this book as soon as it was out. Conspiracies! Suspense! Thrills! I was expecting these all! And yet... Like many others before 100 by Kass Morgan... It left me disappointed... AGAIN. It started with a bang. Were introduced to Clarke, imprisoned somewhere in a space settlement, for allegedly doing a heinous crime, a crime which was also related to her parents. Were informed that in this world, as soon as a prisoner turns 18, he is granted a trial and can either go free or be put to death. Fortunately, Clarke has been chosen as one of the hundred teenage prisoners to be sent to Earth, their previous they left three hundred years ago due to the Cataclysm, an nuclearsomethingradiationsomething event that crippled their planet. They are to be sent there to find out if the world is still liveable, and if they survive, they will be pardoned of their felonies. Sounds exciting, right? Yup, I was ecstatic myself. The general plot sounded like something that could attract A LOT of twists and conspiracies! And then the romance came... Which pretty much ruined this book for me. What would you feel if you were stuck in a planet, all by yourself and 99 other strangers okay, make that 97 because OF COURSE there has to be a love interest and that mandatory best friend, a planet, which, may I remind you, has been labeled toxic due to the immense radiation in the past? Youd think about survival... right? Youd at least TRY to set aside your feelings and think about how you could live for another day, right? Right. Of course. Any rational being would. Unfortunately, Clarke and the rest of the three characters, which all have their own chapters, by the way holy shit, four POVs?!, think otherwise. What could have been a really good scifi, action, postapocalyptic dystopia turned into one mushy dramarama, like those telenovelas from Latin America that my parents used to watch. That means a lot of conflicted feewings, jealousies, love rages, etc. etc. It made me RAGE. Imagine this: you just crashed into Earth with the other delinquents. Youre a boy and you werent supposed to be in this operation, but you risked your life in order to protect the girl you supposedly love but hates you because you betrayed her in the past. A lot of people have been killed on impact, a lot are injured, and a lot are dying. But you focus on that one speshul girl and end the chapter with, Ill make her fall in love with me. If youre that kind of person, come here and let me punch you please. Many times. I felt rage each and every chapter as soon as they got to Earth. Sure, there were some fighting over food, over equipment, over medicine, but those were in passing and in the larger scheme of things, were put aside for the romance aspect. The unnecessary, annoying part took a large percentage of the book that it drove me batshit insane. See, look here. If I wanted drama, I have other avenues for that like my life, for instance and I didnt sign up for it especially when the synopsis is all about Danger! Conspiracies! Survival! It was a constant questioning of WHO KISSED WHO, THEY KISSED WHERE, WHO IMPREGNATED WHO, WHO WAS SEEN EMBRACING WHO, and Im like... fuck you, boo. Fuck you very much. Heres a very memorable quote that would make you want to punch a brick wall: Clarke rose with a groan, her muscles stiff from their hike yesterday. But it was a good kind of pain; shed walked through a forest that hadnt been seen by a single human being for 300 years. Her stomach squirmed as she thought about another distinction shed inadvertently earned  the first girl to kiss a boy on Earth since the Cataclysm. Um... congrats? Awesome priorities, by the way. sarcasm And because the romance aspect was the number one priority, nothing really happened on Earth in this book. Yeah, like I said, there were some fighting here and there, but generally, all of it were just idle stuff. And when exciting events started to happen, BOOM! CLIFFHANGER! GOTTA BUY THE NEXT BOOK GAIS. The writing was also very juvenile. I did not like it at all. I found no depth in it, and was very telling than showing. There were four narrators Clarke, Wells, Bellamy, and Glass and chapters rotated among them, each one having a present and a past thing, which made the flow of the story absolutely terrible and wonky. I kid you not that it gave me a migraine I had to skip the last eighty percent because it was at that point that I GAVE ZERO FUCKS ANYMORE, and a lot of the past stuff were nonsensical gibberish that could have been omitted. Because of that, the characters lacked personalities as well. The characters were complete simpletons. Girl offends guy she kissed, he storms away, and she cries about it  all in 2 pages. Next chapter. Guy gets all moody, and both are acting like they had a nasty, drawnout confrontation when it fucking barely lasted half a page. Aside from that, they were just flat, annoying, and stupid. Clarke was annoying. Shes this holierthanthou character, making herself the kindest of the group when I found her very selfrighteous. Wells, on the other hand, is this dude who threw away everything EVERYTHIIIING to follow Clarke. Hes borderline, Edwardcreepy with his quest to make Clarke fall in love with him again yes, of course! Because that is SO obviously important! Of course, like any other typical YA, here comes Bellamy, the survivalist angrycocky loner whose role also includes themandatorylovetriangle! Theres also Glass, another girl who managed to escape and get back to their spacemoon settlement how they got there we have no idea, who I found extremely superficial and shallow. Here she is, just escaped from a fate supposedly worse than death, and the first person she goes to is of course... her ex. Who she found is with another girl. DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUN... DRAMA ERRBODY! Anyway, fuck them. I see reviews where they are praising the worldbuilding, and Im left scratching my head because Im wondering if we even read the same books. Worldbuilding? What worldbuilding? Unless you count that single sentence explaining there was a sort of nuclearish war 300 years ago and a paragraph of the shady judicial system as worldbuilding, then yeah, okay, fine, but Id have to disagree. How they even got to space and built their orbiting settlement were never even explained in depth in fact, Id wager it was never mentioned at all. YES, GREAT WORLDBUILDING, making everything just one big blur. All in all, I hated this book a lot. I read this while I was on a flight back home and I totally regretted it. I could have made my flight memorable if only I chose something better. I mean, I was disappointed in a lot of dystopiapostapocalyptic books... what would make this any different? Shouldve known better. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. If interested, I really think youre better off watching the show. It may be better than this crap and would probably explain the countless plotholes the novel has. I would imagine some things would be changed. Final Verdict: NOT IMPRESSED.
My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations. Disclaimer: Technically this is not my first time reading this book. Over the years Ive had a lovehate relationship with The Fault In Our Stars. I first read this book in 2013 before it was insanely popular, and I didnt finish it. I only read 150 pages or so, but I couldnt stand Hazel the first time I read this. To be fair, this was at a point in my life where I wasnt reading that many books nor nearly as many as I read now and I rarely ever read YA books. I didnt grow fond of YA books until closer to 2014. But, I watched The Fault In Our Stars movie out of curiosity last year and I absolutely loved it. I began wondering if maybe I should give this book another chance since I have grown to love YA books, and this is considering one of the best of all time by many people. I am so glad I gave this book another chance. Maybe it was just bad timing the first time I read this and I wasnt able to fully devote my attention to these characters, but now I can see why this book is so loved. I picked up the audiobook for this in my library last week and Ive got to say, the audiobook is fantastic. I listened to this every day on the way to work, and the narrator really brings these characters to life. I was crying as I was driving a few times because I was so moved by the words and the way her voice would crack. The isnt the first John Green book Ive ever read but it is the first John Green book Ive ever really loved. Most people know the overall story of The Fault In Our Stars but if you do not, it is about a girl named Hazel Grace and a boy named Augustus Waters who are teenagers suffering from cancer. I feel like this book does an amazing job of not glamorizing cancer, it shows just hot difficult and brutal it can be and it doesnt hold back. Its very honest and I appreciate that. Augustus Waters is such a breath of fresh air. Hes so charming and witty and smart and I adored him so much. I appreciate reading about teenagers who are smart and philosophical and care about important things. It was a nice break from the typical idiotic characters I see so often in YA. Im on a roller coaster that only goes up my friend. This book had so many wonderful moments and wonderful quotes. This is probably one of the most quotable books of all time. My personal favorites are: I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. Thats such a beautiful way to talk about the feeling of falling in love. I also really love: The marks humans leave are too often scars. I really love the idea that the world is not a wish granting factory and that some infinities are bigger than other infinities. It talks about how grief doesnt change you, it reveals you, and how without pain we could never understand joy. There are a lot of deep, beautiful quotes weaved into this story about life and love. I loved reading about their trip to Amsterdam, even if Peter was a douchepants. I love that they are both obsessed with a book and they constantly reference it. I love the joke about drawing a circle to represent virgins and a smaller circle inside that circle is 17 year old boys without a leg. Their sense of humor and sarcasm was so wonderful and relatable. The scene at the gas station made me cry. Gus called Hazel and told her not to call 911 but to come and help him and he was throwing up all over himself, it was so sad. I also cried when they had Guss prefuneral and Isaac and Hazel read their speeches to Gus. When Isaac who is blind said: even if the scientists in the future allowed him to see again he wouldnt want to see a world without Augustus Waters I lost my shit. The funeral was sad, everything that happened within the last few chapters of this book was sad and I was crying. I felt really bad when it was reveled that Peter had had a daughter, and she died of cancer at 8 years old and it explains why he is such a douche bag. I still dont think its an excuse for the way he treated them, but it still made me sad. The last letter that Gus wrote to Peter about Hazel was so beautiful and heart breaking. This book would have been even better if the story ended midsentence, just like Hazels favorite book. We as readers would understand that it was because Hazel died or became too ill to write and I think it wouldve been so ironic and creative. Overall, giving this book a second chance was a great idea. I also think the movie is a perfect adaptation of this book because as I was listening to the audiobook it felt as if I was watching the movie. Hazel and Gus are incredible, thoughtful characters who will live on forever in my mind.
Find the original review here at This is the Story of MyReading Life I am on a roll this year with the poignant, heart wrenching YA contemporaries. The Last Time We Say Goodbye hits its readers right where it counts. I think Hand did a superb job of realistically portraying Lexs struggles with her brothers suicide. As well as the effects of TylersLexs brothers depression and possibly misdiagnosed mental illness. Obviously The Last Time We Say Goodbye is not a happy book. As soon as I opened it and saw the dedication page I had a feeling that Hand was bringing her readers a pretty personal story. Im not sure how much of herself she put into Lex, if any, but either way Lexs guilt over Tylers suicide and her coming to terms with the fact that it wasnt her fault seemed pretty real. Lex feels like she could have prevented Tyler from killing himself. Shes torn up and conflicted over her feelings. Lex is super intelligent, a numbers girl. Its all about logic with her. So her seeing a therapist that suggests she journals about her feelings seems a little silly to Lex. Her journal entries were my favourite part of the book. It showed Lex and Tylers relationship. They had a strong sibling bond and I really appreciated getting to see how they were together. It brought some light into the story. Lex and Tyler were close. They teased and bickered like brothers and sisters do. Lex was able to show that Tyler was a happy kid through these entries, and that their family was a solid family at one time. When their dad left their mom for another women it really hit Tyler hard. It seemed like all he wanted to do was please their dad, and this was something that was unforgivable and truly started Tyler on a downward spiral. Obviously there was a lot going on inside Tylers head, and a lot of the time a person can be a really good actor by not letting their family see how much they are struggling internally. Loss hits us all very differently. Lex shut down and shut out her friends. It was hard for her to see the pity and sadness on their faces and in their voices. Lexs mom is also barely living. She goes to work and the rest of the time shes not totally coherent. Theyre both feeling Tylers ghost haunting their day to day lives and its something that Lex is trying to overcome. She feels like the guilt of ignoring his text will eventually eat her up. Lex feels like she could have prevented his death if she had just been there for him like she promised. Blame and guilt is a nasty thing to stew in. Especially in a horrible situation as this. Lex has really inspiring story of growth. Once she starts to realize that only Tyler could help himself, her motivation comes back. Which she than piggy backs onto her mom. They both needed a push and Lex was able to show her mom that she still has a child left that loves her. Lex also realized that as hard as forgiveness is its something that she needed to jump on the path to with her dad. Lex may have tried to push her friends and boyfriend away, but they continued to be there for her. Lex even found likeness with an old friend shed lost touch with. It was awesome to see that Lex had some really strong friends in her life. They didnt give up on her. That really helped with her learning how to keep moving on. There was a lot of moments that brought tears to my eyes. Ive mentioned plenty of times, that my heart is black. But Hands writing really made a dent in my emotions. Not only was Lexs emotional journey heart breaking, Hand was also able to put humor and sweet moments in with that heart break. A lot of the YA books Ive read that focus on suicide do it through a romantic relationship. Which is fine, and is just as heart breaking. But with Lex losing her brother to suicide it was more hard hitting to me. Shes 18, so losing her brother is somebody shes known her whole life. Tylers death not only showed how Lex dealt with the loss, but also her parents. Theres a stigma with suicide and how it seems to be downplayed when remembering the person. The person is considered selfish and the blame is put on them. It makes me sick and sad that people believe this. Tyler was ill and way to often suicide is the outcome from a mental illness, like depression. Hand does a fantastic job of showing this stigma. Lex cant stand the label shes given, the victim of suicide. Her brother died and no matter how he died he showed be shown respect and remembered as the person he was. Hands Unearthly trilogy is one my favourites. So upon hearing she had a contemporary book dealing with a very hard hitting topic piqued my interest. I loved her writing in Unearthly but theres a small part in my mind that thinks how can you go from paranormal to something so different in The Last Time We Say Goodbye? The answer is perfectly. I love when I get to see an author grow as a writer, and I believe that this is solid proof. The Last Time We Say Goodbye is an absolute beautiful story about loss and the struggles to over come it well trying to move forward in life. Its about learning that letting go doesnt mean forgetting and that its alright to continue living your life. I highly, highly recommend picking up The Last Time We Say Goodbye as soon as you can get your hands on it. Id also suggest having plenty of tissues at the ready.
There is a lot of hype surrounding this book, and as usual, this is completely and utterly justified. One thing to know about me is that I am generally a slow reader. Well, okay, no, Im an average reader but I usually read every single word, I hate skipping when Im reading so longer books generally take me longer to read. Divergent was not like this. I finished this book in just over twentyfour hours. It captivated me so much that I simply could not put it down or think about doing anything else until I had reached the very end. Just for this reason, because I adored it so much, knowing where to start on this review and how to express my thoughts has turned into an extremely difficult task as I want to do this book justice, I want others to pick it up and become enthralled by the words on the page but I also dont want to overhype it. Therefore I am apologising now that this review took so long to publish but Im also going to apologise if this review doesnt do the book justice in your own opinion. I will try my hardest to get a decent view out there for you all though. So, to start, I will focus on the characters. And my, what characters! Within the first few pages of this book, I was already in love with the main protagonist. I found such a strong bond with Beatrice and I could not wait to listen to where the story would go and where it would take me. She was a character that I was able to sympathise with, someone that I could understand and just wanted to cheer on whenever she did something. I think I loved her so much just because I saw so much of myself in her and therefore I saw all of her struggles too. Then we have Four, who just captured my soul. I was in tune with him right from the first time we see him and I just loved how he treated Tris. It was just... so beautiful. I loved that they felt like real people. They had their good qualities along with their bad ones, they had their struggles and their fears and worries and they just felt so... normal and this is one of the hardest things to accomplish when writing and Roth just managed to grasp it. Other great characters include Christina and Will, Tris mum, Eric and Peter. Everyone was just written so well, with such depth and background that it helped to create a realistic illusion of this world. And what a world! Dystopian novels usually have quite a heavy task on their hands when it comes to worldbuilding because the whole idea is that it is a world completely void of our own. One that is full of destruction and despair and yet, at the same time, there is just that inkling of hope. And boy did Roth do a good job of this! It is certainly not an easy feat and I think that this is one of the reasons that I simply loved Divergent so much. I was so intrigued to hear about the different factions and what each of them stand for and why theyre all in separate factions in the first place. And its just so powerful how well she made the idea of being factionless scary and undesirable. Her descriptions were just so well written that I could imagine everything in my mind, could see how the different people would mingle, or not mingle as the case may be, and I just loved the world that was being brought forward to my mind from the page. I was inspired because I am certain that I could never imagine such a place on my own. Not only did Roth create a wonderful world, however, the plot that unravelled throughout the storys process was just... mindboggling. I dont want to give too much away but I will say that she simply has a way with words that managed to grab at my heartstrings. There were twists and turns that were unexpected, twists that were forseen yet still were awesome to read and discover along with Tris and it was really the moments of shock that really captured this book for me. It was slow to begin with, a lot of world building had to happen though, so this was expected, but then it sped up in the middle, with exciting tasks shown and then it was a fastpaced race towards the end and the ending left you just wanting more. I finished the book and simply couldnt think straight because I wanted to read Insurgent straight away. I want to know what happens next. No. I need to know what will happen now. Divergent is not a book that you can pick up and read just for pure entertainment. It is not a light, easy read where you can escape for a few hours in pure bliss. It is a magical story that truly pulls you into a different world, one that lets you escape your own life to live the life of Tris and her factionfilled world. It grabs you by your ankles and it doesnt let you go until you were fully submersed in another reality. Yes, reality. Divergent is one of the best books that I have read in an extremely long time and, dare I say it, rivals The Hunger Games in my affections. It is not a book for the lighthearted, or someone who just wants an easy escapist read, it is for the nittygritty book lovers who crave something more than most books give them. It is simply amazing and one that I am just so glad I owned and even feel a little guilty at how cheaply I managed to buy it. This book deserves to be paid full price for. And with all of that said, it is easy to understand why I am waiting on tether hooks for Insurgent, which is due to be released 363 days after the first on May 1st 2012.
My greataunts fatherinlaw, a jovial Italian, used to have a favourite saying of his: How are you tomorrow? He used to ask it with genuine feeling and curiosity, waiting for you answer as he sat in his usual chair, my greataunts dog Sam curled up at his slippered feet. At the time, I never understood it. I used to tug at my mothers hand and say, Mum  how can you know how youll be tomorrow? My mother brought up the memory to me a few months back and she said to me, He was telling us, in his own way, that there is a tomorrow. That though there is now, and the present moment that were stuck in, that this moment will move on and we will see and live in tomorrow. Now, being older, I find this idea bittersweet and it is with this quaint saying and the feeling that it brings, that I will try my hardest to review The Fault in Our Stars with justice. I decided to start the book today, bringing it with me as I clambered into the back of my familys car  trying to concentrate on the story amid the sound of Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs, which my younger sibling were watching. Immediately, I fell in love with the main character Hazel  her brutally honest analysis of her situation, the world and others utterly refreshing in comparison to the fake and massproduced view of the world that we are so often fed by the media. It would be so easy to start off this review with Hazel, a fighter of cancer... , or, Hazel, a girl battling with cancer... It would probably save me a lot of time and effort  I wouldnt have to analyse her in depth. But thats where that kind of description is just wrong. Because Hazel is so much more than a girl with cancer. One of the most striking features about her is that she is simply a girl. Normal. Sure, she has cancer, but that doesnt make her any less of a person, or make her the person she is. I especially loved how Hazel referred to depression as A side effect of cancer and cancer as a side effect of dying. I know Im probably losing you, but I just wanted to be clear: she isnt Superwoman. She isnt battling cancer in an aweinspiring way. She isnt your typical Nicholas Sparks cancer fighter. She is a girl with a story  a raw, painful, but with flashes of sunlight and bubbly champagne, story of a girl who met a boy and who decided to read books, be loved and love in return. I had just read where Hazel met Augustus for the first time when our car pulled up at the Australian Museum. It was here at the museum where John Greens genius really came to life for me. I was in one of those discovery rooms, and I came across rows and rows of wooden drawers, all with neat little labels. Looking closer, I read the words Butterflies, Spiders, Moths, etc. Being a butterfly gal, I opened the one marked Butterflies first, and stared down into a collection of beautifully coloured butterflies, pinned in neat rows. I looked to my left and saw a few little children gawking at another draw of butterflies...and felt a little sick. I couldnt explain it. It was as if I couldnt quite believe that this was it. I stared at one butterfly in particular  one with turquoise wings, with delicate eyepatterns marking the tips of each wing. And I thought Is this really it? Such a beautiful creature has its life cut short simply to be forever trapped on a pin, in a draw in a dusty museum? And people will think Gees, this butterfly is so pretty! Oh, look at its wings! No one will ever think, Maybe this butterfly had better things to do than just sit there and look nice. Because in this life, often the most beautiful things arent seen. We ignore them. We overlook them. We refuse to face them. This does not mean I hate museums, or insect displays! It was simply drawing a comparison between the display and The Fault in Our Stars. Hazels heart in a notsoliteral sense is quite like the butterflies I spotted today. She doesnt allow it to live, to be free  she refers to herself as a grenade, because she accepts that when she dies, she will probably hurt those around her and close to her. Shes also cautious of allowing Augustus to be with her and to love her. One of the sweetest sentiments Gus expresses to her is Oh, I wouldnt mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you. Lives are meant to be lived. Lungs are meant for breathing. Eyes are meant to see. And hearts are meant to be used, too. Love is meant to be expressed and sometimes it is painful. Sometimes when it is stolen from you, you will be left breathless and stricken  but it is always worth it. Augustus message is always clear to Hazel  that everything is worth it, and that you do not have to do extraordinary things to be extraordinary and beautiful. Even if you dont leave an impact of the world, you can still be an extraordinary person and can be remembered for simply being. This is not a cancer story. This is not a sappy romance about two kids who fall in love and have to deal with the tragedy which is cancer. No. This is a story about a girl named Hazel, who was sixteen and Okay  and who met a boy named Augustus who smoked unlit cigarettes, liked watching V for Vendetta and didnt understand that the point of videogames was to win, not to sacrifice the players life to save the prisoners. Them falling in love is not the point. Them fighting cancer is not the point. The point is that they both liked books, drank champagne, disliked literal hearts and found beauty amidst the foggy chaos of everyday life. They lived. It reminded me of a part of a Sarah McLachlan song I once heard: I will remember you. Will you remember me? Dont let your life pass you by. Weep not for the memories. 
Repaired by Melissa Collins was absolutely FABULOUS!! Im a conservative reader... I read the same type of books over and over. I know what I like. But when I read the synopsis for this one I knew that it was going to be a must read for me. What I didnt expect, because I wasnt familiar with Melissa Collins work, was that I was going to have my heart strings tugged in a way that I cant even express. Love isnt exclusive to any specific group of people... EVERYONE deserves to be loved. PERIOD. I love Liam and Parkers story. They are both broken inside but its not an obvious broken. Theyre both successful in their field. A pothole, an expensive norun flat tire and chance bring them together. I fell in love with them also. I found myself thinking when I was on the train, He could be Parker...or Liam. My heart hurt; it soared with love found. Wed never know how our past would affect our future. Wed never know how today would tumble on into tomorrow. All we could ever do is hold on tight and have faith that somehow it would all work out the way its supposed to. This quote is so powerful and will stay with me for so long.  Heather, 5 stars  Argh, a new MM read, and from one of my favorite authors to boot? That makes me a happy camper. Well, as happy as you can be when someone is punching you in the feels and making it hurt so good... Liam Davis is running from his past. He doesnt want to let anyone in, he cant let anyone in, and hes determined keep it that way. Until Parker Ryan. Parkers future is all planned out. And its going to be an endless cycle of failing in the eyes of his father. Its not what he wants, but its all he has. When luck brings Parker into Liams world, he finds what he wants. He just has to show Liam that he can be the man he needs to help him repair his broken pieces...and to let Liam do the same for him. On the scale of one to God damn it, Melissa, you made me cry again, Repaired rates about an eight. I most definitely felt for these characters as they attempted to make their relationship work despite their lessthanperfect lives. I may not have experienced the brutal ugly cry that Ms. Collins previous works have wrung from me, but there were times in the second half of this book that I feel it in my gut. It? That sick, sad, hurting feeling that makes you want to wrap the characters up in a big hug and hold tight. The first half of this book, on the other hand, had me feeling a little detached. As much as I enjoyed the meetcute for Liam and Parker, as much as I liked the secondary characters that gave support and love where needed along with some sound advice, it felt a little slow and uneven at times, and didnt give me that overwhelming urge to press on despite time constraints. But press on I did, because I had faith that Ms. Collins would get me there. And she did. I fell in love with Liam and Parker; Parker for his strength, his morals, his faith in his us with Liam, and Liam for his bravery in trying to move on and build something real and lasting despite his doubts. Repaired was, in the end, a book that made me feel the words. Made me feel the past and the pain. Made me feel the heat whoa, did it ever...!, but it also made me feel that ache inside. Every page that brought me closer to the final one was blessing and a curse  I was gradually finding the story I had wanted from page one, but I was also getting closer to the end just as I was starting to get attached. As always, when I finish one of Ms. Collins books, Im already chomping at the bit for the next one; another one thatll make it hurt so good, Id imagine.  Beth, 4 stars  Liam Davis is a man with a past hes spent the last ten years trying to forget. Hes done well with thatliving his solitary life one day at a time, happy with his small family of his boss and his bosss wife. Parker Ryan is living a dream lifetoo bad its not HIS dream. Seen as a failure in the eyes of his father, Parker is wanting to break away from the daily criticisms and live his life for himself. The day Parker meets Liam is forgettable and unforgettable. Forgettable because Parker has had an incredibly crappy day. Unforgettable because due to his bad luck, Parker was forced to bang his way into meeting Liambanging on a door, people. Is this random introduction, just what both men need in their lives to help mend the past and move onto the future? Or is it fate? I was so excited to review this new MM book. I love Melissa Collins numerous others and I have to admit I struggled through the first 50. There is quite a bit of internal monologue and seemed repetitive and slow in some parts. Even though I was a bit concerned, I knew that if I continued to push through and keep reading, Ms. Collins wouldnt let me down. And Im damn glad I continued. Liam and Parker are so wonderful together. Especially once they truly understand where the other one is coming from and just what each of them need. Add in the supporting cast of characters who fully enrich the story and you have a winner!  Missy, 4 stars
Its been a long time since I loved a book so much! I cant begin to describe my views and feelings for this amazing book, I am spellbound! I will still try in my humble words to do justice to the work. This book is a love story and yet not just a love story. It has so much to it than the falling in love of two individuals. The book is substantial and intense and very real and is the place where fiction and reality meet. It is one of those books after completion of which you dont start reading just another one immediately; That for a couple of reasons: Firstly to pay respect to this piece of art and depiction of life; and secondly, to live in the reverie of the book for some more time even after its last page is turned and ponder over all the nuances and intricacies of the work. Every line of the book is written with such thought and intelligence as to disable me from finding any part redundant or boring or wanting any skimming. The story is about Margaret Hale, daughter of a country vicar who is uprooted from her cherished home and compelled to take residence in a drastically different manufacturing town. Here she comes across various social dilemmas existent in the town and the disparities within the social classes. Here she meets the rough and proud mill owner and her fathers pupil John Thornton and is thrown in an antagonistic friendship with him leading to a growing respect, regard, admiration and love albeit through various misunderstandings. It also majorly deals with the problems and difficulties of the socially poor and has a parallel storyline dedicated to them. The story is dynamic and major changes can be seen in fewer words throughout the book. In the beginning the detailing of the feelings, majorly of the protagonists is brilliant. I absolutely loved it, especially the parts where Mr Thornton firstly denies and later after the riot, how he realises and acknowledges his undying love for Margaret and later still when he is declined by her and the journey of his emotions throughout the book. The depiction of his pain after the rejection is so intense that the heart wrenches at it. Mr Thornton is a very strong, straightforward and admirable character with a great amount of pride in him. As the story progresses his growth is apparent as can be seen with his growing acquaintance with Nicholas Higgins and his striving for his hands welfare. A remarkable hero who no doubt steals all my awe. Margaret Hale is one of the strongest heroines Ive ever read. A profoundly humane as well as a regal and proud girl with the physical appearance of a princess. What touch the heart and portray her situation are the lines where she thinks how she has passed from childhood to old age without experiencing the pleasures of youth, so immense are her cares, worries, miseries and sorrows. It gives an ache to the heart seeing her forlorn condition after her parents deaths and there being nobody to whom she can look for the same kind of love and support, and her loneliness coupled with the immense guilt and grief of being abased in the eyes and good opinions of Mr Thornton. How she deals with these difficulties and braces her heart and prepares herself for a lonely future is indeed worth reading. Even her growth can be remarked throughout the pages right from her initial dislike of Mr Thornton to her unrealised growth in respect and love for him which seem very real and touching. She is one of my favourite heroines till now. Mr and Mrs Hale are a very soft and attached couple contriving to pass through tough circumstances together. Mr Hales liking of Mr Thornton and their bond is also very beautiful and it feels really bad to see him missing Mr Thornton after the strike is over. Mrs Hales death is weaned onto the reader but what shocks is Mr Hales sudden death. It was really a rude surprise! Same was for Mr Bells demise! Unexpected and sudden. Mr Bells was a very endearing and jolly character which I enjoyed reading. Mrs Thornton is an amazing woman. Proud and strong yet a mother at heart. Nicholas Higgins character is very different and still natural. His pains, sorrows and grief over his daughter and his acceptance of Bouchers childrens responsibility along with his behaviour towards Mr Hale as well as Mr Thornton give him all the shades of a fantastic character. The Lennoxes and Mrs Shaw I thought very shallow though caring towards Margaret, but still they possessed a streak of selfishness and ignorance about them. And she is thought about more only after she becomes an heiress and could possibly have given Henry Lennox a major break. Towards the end of the book the story is kind of forcefully wound up but the author is not to be blamed for that. I found out from a preface to another edition that initially it was published in weekly chapters in a magazine and it was the publishers who compelled her onto a hasty end while she had a somewhat different plan of bringing about the closure. I would give a lot to know what exactly she had meant to write! That is because I had begun to expect much intensity in Margaret and Mr Thorntons reuniting because of the forced repression of their feelings and misunderstandings that had been brought upon them; and those being cleared there should have been an equal intensity in their reuniting as had been in their being drawn to each other and the intense pains that they both had to go through, but sadly that was not to be found! Moreover the readers missed what Mrs Thorntons reaction to Margaret and Mr Thorntons reuniting would be! A thing that I liked is the book gives the views of every individual character and not just of either of the protagonists. Even the secondary characters views are vivid. Also, the couplets and extracts from various prominent poets and writers were beautiful and amazingly relevant. I just did not want the book to come to an end, I was so eager for more! It is indeed A Pride and Prejudice set against a manufacturing towns background. Any fan of classic English Literature must read this book! It was my first Elizabeth Gaskell book and has probed me into delving further into her amazing works! She enlists on my favourite authors list for sure!
Clockwork Princess was more than I could have ever dreamed of. I have been waiting for it for such a long time. Been dreading it forever, because I did not see how it could possibly end happily. But I was surprised. Because Clockwork Princess is amazing. It is a perfect book, and now that I have read it, I know I will reread the entire trilogy in a few short months. I was lucky enough to get my box set of this trilogy yesterday, four days before release date. I just preordered it from book depo months ago, and Im just so happy that they shipped it early to me, because oh, this book was perfect. I had to read it right away. And like always, I just had to peek at the ending before I started A For me, personally, Im glad I did it. But I also think that you all should not peek at the ending, because there are more than just one thing being spoiled. Plus, its so exciting to read it all : Clockwork Princess needs to be loved. My review will not contain spoilers. As in, I wont say who ends up with who, who dies, who lives, and all that stuff :D But I will talk a bit about the book. Some things I loved. And the one thing I might have disliked a tiny, tiny bit. Overall, though, Clockwork Princess left me feeling happy. After Clockwork Angel left me a bit sad, and Clockwork Prince left me feeling destroyed. But then Clockwork Princess happened. And I cant help thinking about all my favorite parts, although most of the book is just a whole favorite part. Everything was amazing. Lots of heartbreak at times, but it is so perfect. Clockwork Princess was truly amazing. I loved this book with all of my heart. Im having trouble finding words for it. But Ill try. First I want to say that there is a lot of love in this book. A lot of relationships. Like Gideon and Sophie. We see a lot of them in this book, which I adored, because I just love Sophie so much, and I think they would make an amazing couple. We also see a lot of his brother, Gabriel. Who I kind of hate because he hate Will :p But I do think that he would be perfect for Cecily, to be honest. He changes in this book. I approved. We also get to see Charlotte and Henry a whole lot. And I loved that. Although it did make me a bit depressed, because things arent going very well for Charlotte with the Counsol. But still. Charlotte and Henry are adorable together, and I loved that she was pregnant. I just loved reading about them all. And oh. We get to see more of Jessamine. It broke my heart. It still hurts. But it was so perfect, and I loved it, and oh. It was amazing. We also see more of Magnus, and he is just so damn perfect. Love him so. We also learn so many other things in this book. More about Tessas clockwork angel. More about the automatons that belong to Mortmain. More about him too. Yeah, we see more of him too. And I kind of loved reading about him; perfect villain. Meaning, I hated him. But yeah. We also learn who Zachariah from City of Lost Souls is. And that was pretty amazing. But oh. The ending. The epilogue. Made me just about die for the last Mortal Instruments book. I need to know what happens! Cannot wait. 3 This book is mostly from Tessas point of view. I think. Maybe. There is just so much Will that I cannot seem to remember. I adore Tessa. I really do. She loves two boys. Jem and Will. And I must admit that I still dont really see Jem as a love interest. But I do adore him. But yes. Tessa is amazing. I didnt hate her for loving them both. I really didnt. Which Im just so glad for. She is also special. Shes immortal, which is kind of sad, but also pretty amazing. We get to know for sure what she is in this book : Then there is Jem. Who is engaged to Tessa. And that just broke me so much in the second book. Did not approve. But oh. I do love Jem. Just love Will more. But yeah. Jem is an amazing character. I love the love he have for Will. Even for Tessa. And I do think that Tessa really loves him, she just loves Will too, and its sort of breaking her in half. I enjoyed reading about Jem. There is only about one small passage from his point of view, though, but it was amazing still. I can see why people love him. Maybe. But my favorite character in these books is and will always be Will Herondale. He is just all kinds of perfect. In book one he was broken. Book two broke him even more. And book three. Well. I wont say much about it. But oh. Will is perfect. Hes funny and sweet and kind and so damn selfless. He loves Jem so much. He would do anything for his parabatai. I loved that. I loved his and Jems relationship. I just really loved reading about Will and Jem together : And Will and Cecily together. Adored them all. Then there is him and Tessa. I want them together more than anything. He loves her so so much. And it breaks my heart all the time. Just see my teasers.. Its heartbreaking. And amazing. And ah. I wont spoil anything. You just need to read this book. And I want to talk about it all. I really, really want to, but I wont, because it would just spoil everything. Just know that I loved this book. I loved everything that happened. Every. Single. Thing. Especially page 419. Best pages ever. Really, truly the best. Clockwork Princess is amazing. Like I have said a billion times now. But it is. Im so glad I read it. It was just so worth the wait. And I think everyone will be pleased with it. Some might not, but I hope all will. I was, at least. There is a small thing I disliked a little. The epilogue and the end. I loved the ending of the book. I really, truly did. But I kind of wish the epilogue hadnt happened. You know, the 130 years in the future thing. But I also loved getting to know some things. But it is also heartbreaking. Like really heartbreaking. There was one thing I wasnt thrilled about, but it made sense, so I kind of enjoyed it. One thing you should know. If you get the Clockwork Princess first edition, do NOT look inside the book cover until AFTER you have read the book. Because yeah. The family tree is there on the cover, and its kind of easy to notice things ;p I didnt check it first, and Im glad I did, but yeah, its very spoilery, so dont do that at first : But oh. You need to go buy Clockwork Princess. Because it is amazing. A perfect ending to the trilogy, even with my mixed feelings about the epilogue ;p Read it, love it. You need it. While reading Clockwork Princess I wanted to take a picture of all the pages, to save my favorite quotes and lines. I actually ended up with a lot of pictures. Most are way too spoilery to share, though, but I will share at least one teaser below. And if I do say so, its pretty awesome. Clockwork Princess was just amazing. So much better than I had believed. And it has made sure that I will be reading the first two books again. It felt like I had forgotten a few little things, but not that much : Hope you all love it. Want a couple of teasers? See my review post on my blog here: 
As this is the fifth book, there will most likely be spoilers in this review. When I first started this book, I knew it was going to be intense. I just wasnt expecting it to be as intense as it was. There was so much going on, so much that happened, and my mind was reeling after reading it, trying to comprehend everything that happened, everything that is to come, and so much more. And to be quite frank: I absolutely enjoyed it. I found that the plot followed a steady stream from where it left off in Queen of Shadows and took a lot more darker turns, a lot more sexual turns, and showed a lot more teamwork, friendship, and hardship. It was one that I found to be full of action  and a lot more devastating action than before. There were heartbreaks and upsets, but there was also hidden joys and bits of happiness that could also be found. So lets take a look into the characters, shall we? Aelin continues to grow stronger in her magic in this book, which I highly appreciate given I wanted more after the last two books from when she really started to hone her skills into the Fire Wielder she is now. Holy crap, shes powerful, and at times I felt like she was too powerful, but I was also glad to see that even her magic has limits, that even she is susceptible to burnouts, and that she needs to replenish her magic just like all of the others who have magic have to, too. I found Aelin to be more arrogant in this book, even if it was a front sometimes, but I also found her to be more unwilling to share any sort of plans with her comrades. I felt that that was where her downfall was, because then maybe some certain events could have been prevented more, but at the same time, probably not. Despite having so much arrogance, its not that Aelin doesnt trust her friends with things she does tell Lysandra some things, but its that she feels that if her plans fail that her friends will hate her for it  again, another character flaw, but one that was well done, in my opinion, because her friends got that and understood it even if they did get a bit mad afterward. She was such a strong, kickass version of herself in this installment, and I need to know what happens to her next because she just got into a lot of shit at the end there. Oh man. Rowan was ever the protective Fae male warrior who definitely lusted after Aelin a lot, but as those scenes between then grew and grew until they practically burst, I found that I was growing to like it more and more. Even if it was a bit much sometimes. Its not that I didnt enjoy what went on between them, but I feel like we lost a bit of the warrior Rowan we saw in Heir of Fire in these last two books. I mean, he still kicks ass and hes still fierce, and willing to take down a whole arming of ilking if the need arose, but I wanted more of that stern, snarky warrior we once had before. Manon. Oh, my ever loving heart, Manon. She was phenomenal. She was still cool and calculating, ready to rip peoples throats out, but I saw that humanity in her, the one she thought didnt exist, especially when it came to a brutal decision that was forced upon her and her Thirteen. When she stood up to her grandmother, you bet I was cheering for her. Shes powerful and strong, and cunning, and I love that even though she says she doesnt need anyone, she really does. I dont know if shes truly realized that yet, but shes definitely a powerful force to be reckoned with and Im really interested to see how she goes about accepting her bloodline, what will happen next, and if there will be any resolve as a result of it. ELIDE. FREAKING. LOCHAN. Where the hell were you hiding, girl!? Elide definitely grew on me in the last book, but in this one? Oh, she has my whole heart now, because she just showed so much growth and strength and heart, and I thought that she was just incredible in this book. Not only did she set out on her journey to find Aelin, to do what she could for her queen, but she also showed that shes not this frail little thing, but she has a fighting spirit. I loved her time spent with Lorcan, strained though it was, and I thought that the two were two sides of the same coin in ways. We got to learn more about her, how she uses her cunning to get through many situations, and that shes willing to risk a lot for those she cares about. I need more of her in my life. Now. Speaking of Lorcan, I love him. And yes, Im totally 100 shipping him and Elide together. Even though he was kind of a jerk at the end and all of that, I want them to be together. He was very hard to crack at the beginning, very serious and hellbent on completing whatever mission he had set out to complete, but as time progressed alongside Elide, I thought that he softened a bit and slowly came to realize that there is more to life than fighting and death and destruction. I think hell really try to atone for his mistakes in the next book for sure. Dorian was so cool in this book no pun intended. He really got a hold over his magic and I thought that he did really well in learning just what that magic held. He was still kind of a lost puppy at the beginning, but he still proved that he was worth something as the book progressed, and that he was still hurting when a certain scene happened that I feel didnt really need to happen, but there it was because ohmygodthatsexualtension. Anyway, I thought that Dorian was strong in ways even he didnt realize, and I really appreciated that. Aedion and Lysandra just need to get together already. Both of them proved how strong they are in different ways and how far theyre both willing to go for their companions. I found that Aedion was just as protective and hot headed as ever, and that Lysandra was really a cool calm before the storm. They really mixed well and balance each other out nicely, thats for sure. I love how much potential each of them holds and am anxious to see more of what theyll have to show in the next book. As for the rest that happened? Oh, where do I even begin? There was so much more added to the story, and bits and pieces of the story from before we even knew certain characters that was shown and unfurled as the plot progressed. I loved seeing a lot of it and felt that it wasnt too much or overbearing, but just what the characters needed in that time. Also, can we talk about Erawan and Maeve? I seriously feel like theyre conspiring together, but both of them are so good at hiding things from everyone around them, I cant be sure that thats actually true. And I really dont like Maeve. At all. ALSO, all of those characters that came back from the novellas!? I loved that! Seeing Rolfe, Ansel, and the others was just so, so awesome and I hope that they play a bigger role in the next book. There were just a few things that nagged me and bugged me that happened in the book that is causing this to not be a full five star read for me, and that is the amount of sex scenes in the book. I mean, Im all for a good sex scene and it being a positive experience for the characters and all that, but I felt like there was just too much of it going on amidst the chaos of the rest of the book. Maybe it was to break up the tension, but maybe it could have been done in different ways. Like, every other character pairing wanted to get into each others pants. Chill your hormones. Im very interested to see what happens in the last book insert sobbing here because there is going to be a LOT of action, a LOT of heartbreak, and I can already feel my heart sobbing in many different ways. I rate this book 4.755 stars and highly recommend it if youve read the rest of the series.
Warning: Spoilers! Alrighty, lets start this review! In the long run, I really liked the concept that this book was trying to convey. The idea of 4 different worlds very, very different from each other, like blocks placed next to each other. Something out of the ordinary to me. Which is a great thing! Theres Red London, a world enamored in magic. Magic is the way of life, really. Then there is Grey London, and like the name suggests, they have a duller way of life. aka the way we are The magic has gone and become something of myths and legends. On the other hand how many hands do humans have again?, White London is bleeding itself dry over magic. They want more and will do anything to have it. And of course, there is Black London. A place nobody ventures since the doors to it are sealed, and probably wouldnt even if they could. The magic there became corrupt and took over. Not exactly a friendly place. As for the characters, there are our MCs, Kell and Lila. Lets make it clear at the start, Kell was wonderful to me and Lila was...lacking. Kell has a depth of emotion and this was made clear during his chapters. And Lila, although she has the potential, she felt very boring to me. I understand that her life was hard and she never complained about it. In a way, she embraced it and loathed those with more than her that took it for granted. There were moments I liked her and what she stood for. But there were other moments far more numerous when I disliked her. Shes headstrong and strong willed, but for being a thief someone that has to think of their every action she didnt think of what she was doing and frankly I dont know how she survived as long as she did. As for Kell, besides the overused trope of how blatantly special he is, I liked him. I may just have a bias for male MCs, but I preferred his chapters as I begrudgingly read through Lilas. He has compassion and loyalty, even with his doubts and feelings of being an object to the crown. His feelings towards his brother, Rhy, were very strong and he would do anything for him, Im sure. In my mind, his love potential towards Rhy is far above that of his with Lila, if there is going to be any at all. I dont think Im imagining it and I really hope that Im not. Id love to see him struggle through the process of his feelings for his stepbrother far more than Id like to see him fall for Lila. Anywho, that aside, Kell was willing to sacrifice his life for his world. He didnt think of how to get around this, he simply accepted that it would be the easiest way of saving them. Very noble of him. Id have liked to be able to feel where his loyalty towards his world came from, but I guess when you know what the other options are, youd want Red London over anything else. I suppose since I mentioned him Rhy should be on here as well. He is the prince of Red London and a very likable and charming person. Its made very clear that he has a wide taste in his sexual life. He wasnt seen that much, and if I have one gripe, it would be that Id like to see more character relations. I was merely told that Kell and Rhy have a strong relationship, but I didnt see it. Id love to develop a stronger sense of their bonds. The main villains of this book were bland to me. They seemed ambitious and mean for no reason other than power. And while Im sure that there are people like that Im looking at you GoT, Id still like depth. Background. Something! For instance, what was done with Holland, who seemed to suffer through his entrapment and made me pity him. He wasnt flat. He had character, and though his motives were hard to understand that made him all the more enticing to read about. The world building is lovely and enticing. I loved the sharp contrasts between the worlds and their people. Although it took me a while to wrap my head around the different worlds, I understood by the time I needed to. Schwab has a wondrous way with words and I applaud her. I also like how the different worlds have their own languages. It helps deepen the lore. I was left guessing at the cultural influences used for each world, but I cant quite figure it out. I assumed some sort of Scandinavian for White London, though. The plot was fast paced and so much happened! It would be hard for me to explain all the different points in a few words. A big thing for me was that the romance was left to a minimal. It was barely there and it wasnt lingered over. And that means so much to me. Something else lacking for me was the fight scene between the villains and our MCs. It felt like it was over far too quickly and easily. Overall, though, I really enjoyed ADSoM! There were some elements missing, but not many. I try to not critic a book too harshly, as many times, there is no flawless book. I base a lot of my review on how the book made me feel and this one was easy to get lost in. Also, I havent mentioned, but look at that cover! Its fantastic! Final Rating: 4.5 of 5
Well damn, this was a really cute book. It follows a teen boy named Simon who is gay but hasnt come out yet, and he is emailing this anonymous person he calls Blue that is also a teen that goes to his school but is not okay with coming out yet. One day this kid named Martin finds all of Simons emails and blackmails him saying if Simon doesnt put in a good word for him with this girl he likes, then he will post screen caps of their emails on the schools tumblr page. I thought the premise of the book sounded intriguing and I got so much more from this book than what I was expecting. Not only is this book a light cute contemporary read about a boy discovering his sexuality, but Simon also has a lot to say about our society, and he makes some really good points. He constantly brings up the idea that everyone should come out because straight shouldnt be the default. And he doesnt understand why he even needs to come out in the first place and declare his sexuality because he doesnt understand why everyone just assumes youre straight. I never thought about it in this way and hes absolutely right. Its kind of messed up if you think about it. By assuming everyone is straight it makes it seem like its not normal or not okay to be anything but straight. I just love that Simon really makes a point of this during the story. White shouldnt be the default any more than straight should be the default. There shouldnt even be a default. Simon is a totally relatable character. Even though he has a close group of friends, he sometimes feels left out and sometimes his friends hang out without him and he feels hurt, and this is something I can totally relate to. I felt the same way in high school. Also, he struggles constantly with debating whether or not to come out to his parents and his friends and he doesnt want to make it a big deal but he thinks it is and it was just really fascinating to watch him grow and develop and learn more about himself. Even though I am straight, I found these moments with Simon to be so inspiring and encouraging. He talked about the ocean between people. And how the whole point of everything is to find a shore worth swimming to. I was trying to figure out who Blue was throughout the entire book and I was so wrong. I thought I knew for sure to. I had two different people I thought it was and it was neither of them, so props to the author for actually being able to surprise me because it doesnt happen often. I absolutely adored Simon and Blues emails back and forth. They just put a smile on my face every time I read them, and it was adorable. I love their thing with Oreos, its just so unique and I love when books include random cute things like that. Things like that are what make a book different from all the other books. I love watching Simon experience all these new things, like drinking his first beer and really falling in love for the first time. I also loved reading about Simons very strange family. The force him to watch The Bachelorette and then skype his sister whos away at college to discuss it with her; and I mean really discuss. Its hilarious. I also love how on Christmas they play Facebook Scavenger Hunting and they have to find a post related to: Someone visiting somewhere tropical, someone who just broke up, someone who posts song lyrics, etc. Its just so unique and hilarious and Ive never heard of anything like that before. That also has a lot to say about our society when you think about it. Our Facebook posts are so shallow and repetitive you can literally play a scavenger hunt game with them. Just another one of the many reasons I dont use Facebook. But Im tired of coming out. All I ever do is come out. I try not to change, but I keep changing, in all these tiny ways. I get a girlfriend. I have a beer. And every freaking time, I have to reintroduce myself to the universe all over again. Simon is also very sarcastic and its freaking hilarious to read about. Like this: I spend all Sunday in my room switching between the Smith and Kid Cudi at top volume, and I dont even care if its too random for my parents. Their minds can stay blown for all I care. Its little things like that that really made this book great for me. Its so funny and he shares the same sense of humor and use of sarcasm as I do. Its just wonderful. I think my favorite side character is Abby. She is so supportive of him and its really sweet and adorable. But I also did like Leah and Nick, even though at times their relationships got a little dramatic. I couldnt believe Martin and how he constantly threatened to blackmail him, it was ridiculous. He was such an asshole throughout most of the book. People really are like house with vast rooms and tiny windows. And maybe its a good thing, the way we never stop surprising each other. Overall, I really adored this story. Its just so cute and fluffy and everything you would expect it to be and more. Its mysterious as you try and figure out Blues true identity, and its adorable and rewarding when you do. I love the relationships he shares with his friends and his family. Its just a hella cute read.
I hope you never allow yourself to believe I went through with it because you failed me in some way. All those nights you held me and just let me cry...you have no idea how many times youve already saved me.  Losing Hope So if yall didnt know Hopeless was my favorite read in 2012 and my second favorite read of all time  which is amazing because I have read a lot...So when I found out that Holder gets his voice and Colleen was giving us his voice I was ecstatic. I was so very eager to get my hands on Losing Hope because I wanted to know every little thought, every little whisper, every little emotion that Holder felt in Hopeless and Colleen Hoover did not disappoint. I was in a constant state of emotion while reading this, I felt like I was right there in the story I connected to Holder and SkyHope so much and I felt everything. I felt every smile, every laugh, every tear, every fear, everything and when an author can make a reader feel everything you know that, that author is an amazing storyteller and Colleen Hoover has proved to me again that she will give us more wonderful stories in the future. When reading Hopeless did you ever wonder what Holder was thinking after Les died? When you were reading Hopeless did you ever wonder if their lives ever crossed paths after Hope was taken? Did you ever wonder exactly what Holder blamed himself for? Well in Losing Hope we get it all, we get Holders story. It is beautiful, heartwarming, devastating, and filled with so much love and hope and I am so glad we get to hear his voice. So this is my review for Losing Hope but I urge you if you havent read Hopeless yet please do not read this review and go get Hopeless, read it and fall in love with it than come back and read this. The boy who lost Hope Losing Hope I cant say enough about how perfect this book was  it just was! You learn so many new things that you didnt read in Hopeless and I have to say some of it shocked the hell out of me. Its the same story but so much more because you get to see everything that was happening to Holder and let me tell you THERE. WAS. A LOT. We all know what happened to Les but we learn so much more about Les and how Holder dealt with losing her. He opens his soul in this story and I wanted to grab it and handle it with care because I could tell how badly he was hurting just from his words and it broke my heart. I experienced the ugly cry again in Losing Hope and I cant get over this story. I went into this story thinking that we would get Hopeless from Holders POV but boy was I wrong  I learned so much more about him. His past, present, and future apart from HopeSky, we learned about him apart from Hopeless, this is really HIS story not his POV from Hopeless! Every single time I close my eyes I see Less eyes. Every time my mother looks at me, shes watching me tell her that her daughter is dead for the second time. For the third time. For the thousandth time. Every time I take a breath or blink or speak, I experience her death all over again. I dont sit here and wonder if the fact that shes dead will ever sink in. I sit here and wonder when Ill stop having to watch her die.Losing Hope Your heart will break for Holder learning all the things that he went through and all the guilt he held in himself for the things that happened to Les and Hope. It made me sad for him because none of it was his fault. I watched as he crumbled and lost all hope and all I wanted to do was comfort him and tell him everything was going to be okay. The journey that Holder goes on in Losing Hope is a beautiful and sometimes scary journey. Knowing what happens I found myself anticipating the next scene, the next chapter wanting to know exactly how he reacted over a certain situation or a certain conversation. What I didnt expect that I was so glad Colleen gave us was she gave us so much more of Holders reactions and so much more of his thoughts and it truly just made it that much more beautiful. I dont think she could have done it any better. Holder is still Holder and oh so much more. He is sexy, passionate, caring, loving, sometimes a bit confusing, but god he has a way with words. Let me inform you of something, I say, lowering my voice. The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if youve never felt anything when someones kissed you, then no ones ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you. Squuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuueeeeeee he makes my heart melt and I know he will make yours melt. He is just so Holder and just so Dean and just so everything that is beautiful in this world. I want my very own Holder to come home to every night because good grief the love that boy has inside him that he has to give is an all consuming love and that is the type of love I want. I found myself smiling a lot while reading Losing Hope because I was remembering so many wonderful moment from Hopeless that I got to relive again since I didnt write a review for Hopeless because it was before I started writing reviews which I am kind of sad about that I dont have a review for Hopeless because it defiantly deserves an amazing review. I smiled and remember the moment that Holder spoke these words to Sky and it quickly brought butterflies back to my belly. I live you, Sky, I say against her lips. I live you so much. Now you too can smile and gush over all things that are Dean Holder. I even fell in love with Daniel in Losing Hope and Breckin too. You know Daniel is Holders closest friend and Breckin Skys second very best friend in the entire world. Daniel and Breckin brought a bunch of humor to this story and I found myself cracking up at some of the things that would come out of Daniels mouth! Why are you being such a cunt nugget? I thought Mormons werent allowed to have caffeine, I say to him. Breckin shrugs. I decided to break that rule the morning I woke up gay. I could continue to go on and on and on about Losing Hope because the pages within the bounds of this book hold so much and will pull out so many different emotions from you. But the point of this long review is that Colleen Hoover is brilliant. She gave us Hopeless and then gave us more of Holder in Losing Hope and all I can say is buy it, read it, and fall even more in love with Holder because I promise you Holder will forever hold a piece of your heart. He stole a bigger piece of my heart in this story and I can tell you, he will do the same to you! For the next few minutes, were completely lost in what feels like sheer perfection. Time has completely stopped, and all Im thinking about while we kiss is how this is what saves people. Moments like these with people like her are what make all the suffering worth it. Its moments like these that keep people looking forward and I cant believe Ive let them slip by for an entire month.  Losing Hope Hopeless and Losing Hope will stay with me forever.

Addie has a unique power where she can see the different outcomes of a choice in her life. She can only look into her own future and she usually doesnt look further than a few hours or days. Too many extra memories to deal with. The farthest she ever looked was one week when she waned to see how a date to the dance with Bobby would have went. It was awful so she kept her memories. Laila could erase them but if she erased them then Addie wouldnt remember why she should stay away from him. When Addies parents decide to divorce they give her the choice of where to live. It is a huge decision since her dad will be leaving the compound to live with Norms. Addie will look a full six weeks into both futures in order to make her choice. The lives are told through alternating chapters. Choice 1 or Team MomParaDuke as I like to call it lol Addie is sad that she doesnt get to be with her dad so she decides to do some teenage rebelling that she read about in books. She is pursued by the very charming quarterback of the football team, Duke. Addie is usually into the reserved type but Duke peruses her relentlessly so it would be hard not to give into his charm. He says all the right things and makes her feel special and popular. I really liked Duke. He wasnt perfect but I felt for him and the difficult decision he was facing. During this choice we also got to know Addies best friend Laila more. She has the power to erase memories which makes them a perfect friend combo. If Addie doesnt like the way one choice goes, Laila can erase it out of her mind. Although Addie explains how she sometimes looks to the future and sees that one choice was so much fun but lead to getting in trouble so she doesnt take it. But she will always have that happy memory even if it never happened. Kind of sucks for Laila who will never live the choice with her though. I enjoyed this choice because Addie stayed at the paranormal compound. I really wanted to learn more about it but the book focused more on her choice. I really hope to get further into this world in the sequel. Choice 2 Team DadNormTrevor This choice is a big culture shock for Addie. The outside world is very different from where Addie originally lives inside the paranormal compound. She has no idea how to make friends with Norms especially when she has to hide a big part of who she is. Looking at things in our world confused her but made me laugh. She attends a football game and meets Trevor who she decides will become her new best friend. Trevor is exactly Addies type, shy and reserved, but then Addie learns that Trevor actually used to be a football player but was recently injured when playing against Lincoln High, Addies paranormal school. Lincoln High was actually the name of my high school! A new mystery of whether or not paranormal students are using their powers incorrectly. There is also a murder mystery that her dad researches. Trevor was so sweet and a perfect friend to Addie. He saw the real her but Addie desperately wanted to tell him the truth about her powers. The compound had strict rules about who to tell. I also didnt understand why Addies dad was looking into the murders so undercover. The compound seems to be hiding too much. Laila is really distant since Addie left her. Laila avoids a lot of her calls and hangs out with Bobby who Addie used her power to see that he would have been a big jerk on their date. I didnt like Laila in this version. I understand that Addie left her but was sad with the way she treated Addie. About both choices It is so hard to review and explain this book without giving too much away and also trying to explain what I liked about each life at the same time. lol I have no idea how the author kept both worlds lined up! That is what I really loved. Both choices have events line up and there are little clues scattered in both lives to give you hints to the mysteries. I somehow didnt guess it. Looking back maybe I should have but my mind was everywhere at once And mostly on the boys as it always is! It makes me really want to go back and read it a second time. Especially since I was literally up all night reading. So many emotions and trust issues while reading. I couldnt decide who or what choice was better and who or what to trust. It was crazy in a perfect way! I also liked that it didnt feel like a love triangle. Even though there are two love interests they are both in separate lives so there isnt any of that cheating or the guys fighting over her. I loved the build of both relationships. No instalove at all. They felt very real to me and very close to the way I fell in love in high school. I had butterflies with Addie. Then is slowly becomes clear which guy is best for Addie. Of course I still really liked both guys but one guy was better for Addie. Making a choice As you can guess both lives have good things and bad things but one life had something horrible. I kind of expected her to make the choice she did but at the same time was a bit surprised. To try to change the choices would risk something even more disastrous happening. Like in Sliding Doors I guess no choice is perfect and no matter what choice you make shitty stuff is going to happen but maybe in the end you will always end up where you are supposed to be and maybe you couldnt avoid certain things no matter what. My mind was reeling for days off of it! It makes you wonder...where you might have been if... Anyway it was a brilliant book and I want Laila to erase my memory of reading this book just so I can read it again for the first time! It didnt end exactly how I wanted but what I did love was that it was fully wrapped up with no cliffhanger! Although I still thing about it often and cant wait to see what happens in the sequel!  First of all, I cant just ask the universe if Duke likes me. It doesnt work that way. I have to be faced with a choice. There is no choice here. Second, even if I did get the opportunity to find out my future with Duke, I wouldnt, because if it tells me I end up liking that guy then Ill just kill myself now. You know what else the average girl whos acting out does? Duke asks quietly. I glance once at Laila, but its obvious she cant hear us. What? She starts spending her all her time with the boy whos no good for her. And that boy would be...? Me, of course. No, its not that. Its that if everyone else likes something, that something usually knows it and has a huge head because of it. The things I have to hunt for dont even realize how awesome they are. Smile, Im about to embarrass you. Please dont. But before I even finish the words, Duke stands and says, Everyone, this is Addie, my girlfriend, and her best friend, Laila. Introduce yourselves when you get a chance. He shrugs.Doesnt help to waste my time thinking about wouldvebeens. Laila whispers, He says to the girl with a mind full of them.  I received an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review
When It Rains by Lisa De Jong 5 emotional very teary stars!! We tend to regret our yesterdays, live in our todays and forget about our tomorrows, but Im trying to cherish them all. WOW, see that splodge there  , those are tear stains and a lot of tears were shed whilst reading this book and writing this review. This is one emotional rollercoaster!! But once you are on it, you just dont want to get off...you have to read until the very last word is devoured. Kate was an outgoing girl, until one night, something happened and her outlook on life changed. She changed and it wasnt for the better. She had a best friend called Beau, they had been friends since they were 5, even he couldnt get through to her. Noone knew why she had changed, just that she had. She kept herself to herself. She would still talk and text Beau but not on the same level they used to. 2 years had passed and Beau was going off to college, Kate had decided not to go and was taking a year off. Beau needed to get a few things off his chest before he went, it pained him to see her so withdrawn and distant and he just wanted to try and get through to her. The talk, left their friendship in even more tatters than it was before. Kate begins to shrink further and further away, she wants Beau to have the full college experience so she starts ignoring texts and phone calls, separating herself even further from the one person that has been there for her and kept her grounded. One day, in the little diner where Kate works, in walks Asher...handsome, cocky, but has an ability to see right through Kate. He perseveres, breaks down her walls, they become friends and then lovers. Kate has her secrets, Asher has his, will all be revealed or will some secrets not be told till it is too late? I feel like he was sent here to awaken my soul, but he chose not to stop there. He awakened everything This book is emotionally powerful, it will make you laugh, cry, love, hate, guttural stomach wrenching ugly sobs and more love. It has everything, we have friendships, hardships, falling in love, passion and lots of angst. You dont live because of me. You live because you let me love you. You made the choice to breathe all on your own...I just helped you find the strength to inhale. As usual, I cannot go into too much detail else it will spoil it for you all, but I cannot convey how this book affected me. My eyes were big puffy balls and red rimmed , my nose lets not go there! but you get the picture, not pretty at all! It takes a lot for an author to get you into that state but Lisa De Jong managed to do it with ease. The writing was fluid, the story flowed beautifully, but most importantly, you felt it in your heart. Kate became your friend and you were living through it with her, you went through everything she did and you couldnt help but be drawn into this story with your heart, body and soul. I also realise that theres a difference between soul mates and true love. Looking at the surface, they are similar, but when I dug deep down inside, I found they were different. I felt so sorry for Kate, I wish she had the strength to talk about what she was going through, but she kept it all inside. It was hard to read about her become so broken, you felt her on that downward spiral and that she felt that there was nowhere else to go. She loved Beau but couldnt give him back the kind of love he deserved so she felt she had to let him go. This killed me! My heart broke for Beau at this point so I was not a happy bunny when Asher came on the scene. Asher, he steals your heart, I always struggle when I fall in love with both characters. This is not a love triangle though, so dont panic! I didnt want them to get together at first, I wanted her to go with Beau but once he crawls under your skin and into your heart you do not want to let him go. He really was such a lovely character. Yes he has his past but he has tried to not let it dictate his future, he has left that to fate. He now feels that life is punishing him for his sins, but since he has met Kate, he has been a totally different person, these two really do bring the best out of each other. They truly have a forever kind of love. I told you that every star in the sky was made for you, and they were, Kate. You light up my world even in my darkest moments. I am glad that Kate had people that cared for her, she needed them throughout this book and they stepped up to the plate when needed. There was one point I could have slapped Beau, but I forgave him as we are talking about Beau, he was adorable. Yes, Kate, Im going to miss you. Im so damn in love with you, I can barely stand to spend a few hours apart from you, and now were going to be miles apart. It sucks. It really effing sucks. Just have a read and savour the story, have a big tub of icecream, your favourite chocolate and a box of tissues handy as you will need all the comfort you can get! Lisa de Jong, an amazing story, I cannot wait to see what you write next. Loving you is easy, but it makes this so much harder. www.theromancecover.com
HOLY SHIT  I AM ACTUALLY FAN GIRLING OVER THIS BOOK SO BADLY. This book has given me the biggest reading slump EVER. I have never EVER not been able to carry on ; reading other books after a really good one... I seriously wanted to read this again after I finished the last page.. and I kept looking to my shelf for something to read and catching my eyes darting back to that book. RAINBOW ROWELL WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!?!?!?!? I have to admit this is one of my alltime favourite YoungAdult novels ever. It was so fun and light, that I just couldnt stop reading. This is definitely a novel that I would pick up time and time again, or recommend to anyone that loves a relatable, comical and very witty story line. The plot contains a multitude of main characters; Wren and Cather Avery, Arthur Avery, Levi Stewart, Regan, Nick Manter, Professor Piper, Alejandro, Courtney and Laura Avery. I wont go through all of them  but I will talk about the main characters I like. The novel sets off with meeting the twin sisters Cather and Wren Avery who are freshman at the University of NebraskaLincoln. The twin sisters who are identical are completely different in personality. Cather who is a shy, introverted and anxiety ridden young adult compared to her boisterous, extroverted and confident little bit older twin sister Wren. Cather and Wrens relationship begins to strain when they get to the university, as Cather who is so anxious about change comes to the conclusion that her sister doesnt want to room with her. Wren who takes university life a little far becomes distant with Cather, drinking herself into oblivion even on school nights. Until she has a wakeup call and has her stomach pumped. Im not much of a drinker but I have heard getting your stomach pumped is by far not a pleasant experience in the slightest. Cather is roomed with a girl named Regan who is hard to get along with in the beginning because she is sooooo BLUNT and down the line. I can totally relate to Cather in regards to being anxious in social settings with other people. Regan and Cather form a really solid relationship in their own quirky way, I love that they are so different. Chalk and cheese, ying and yang. So it leads onto Levi Stewart who crashes and hangs out in their room with Regan Who is Regans first boyfriend from her home town but now just friends. So you can see where Cather would feel MAJORLY AWKWARD at this point. Cather at first doesnt really like Levi hanging around so much... BUT Levi who is a protective person feels obliged to look after and even guide Cather through her freshman days. I am so glad that Cather finally realised after screwing it up with him result of being socially awkward and nervous that she actually loves him. So glad because they helped each others selfgrowth through the book, and taught each other what it is like to care and really love someone with all your heart. Cather who writes fanfiction Carry On about a book which is about Simon Snow and Baz who live in a world where they are magicians and attend a magical school, they are sworn enemies due to Baz being a vampire. Cather blogs the chapters she has written, which has a HUGE following. And of course Levi loves Cathers fanfiction. It is sooo nice to see the relationship, as awkward as Cather thinks she is Levi still loves her for exactly who she is. Faults and all, which is ssooo great BECAUSE I feel like people are so obsessed with the stereotypical appearances, rather than focused on the good attributes people have. I think that was my favourite part of this whole book, that two completely different people could come together and love each other for exactly who they are. The fanfiction really makes me happy, because Cather is out there doing something that she loves, regardless of what anyone thinks of her and or the blog. I as a young adult and growing up in the world of social media feel the pressures of needing to be in the norm where to be honest I am far from it... so in hindsight, Cather keep doing what youre doing because regardless of what anyone thinks, as long as you love it and it brings you joy then thats all that matters. Cather is currently studying English where she is pushed to her limits in a fiction writing class where her Professor pushes her to step outside of the box from fanfiction, Due to her love for Fan Fiction she manages to write something really great, which wins an award at the University. The book is pretty much just a light hearted day in the life of Cather the freshman at university, away from her dad who is now on his own and suffers from bipolar I believe. After their mum left them when the twins were eight years old  because she just couldnt be a mum anymore SUCH A LAME EXCUSE  which made me hate her even more than I did. I could totally relate with Cather in regards to the hurt she felt. Cather the more reliable and responsible child feels obliged to help her dad stay on track. I found Cather just a relatable character. Down to her low selfesteem, quirkiness, her love for fanfiction which I think is awesome, being socially awkward and just down right funny in her own little way. This story warmed my heart; I have never read a book that I loved as much as I did this one. The story flowed, the plot wasnt boring and the characters only got better as it progressed. Rainbow Rowell, you are a damn great writer and I will never stop rereading this book!
8717 update: Its past time I gave this a proper review. This is my fifth time through this two on audiobook, so that should say something. Its surprising that I would love this so much since Im largely indifferent to books about social justice, and thats a huge chunk of this story. I will point out that the only part that annoys me is chapter 23 where Atticus flat out preaches on the evils of the justice system, class warfare, a bit of racism, etc. I dont even disagree with him, but its the delivery that irks me. Ill let Bill Cosby explain it. I guess its ironic that hes a black man whos dealing with his own issues with the court system right now, but if you need any proof that weve come a long way since the 1930s, and the 1995 OJ verdict didnt provide ample evidence for you, then the Coss situation should be it. For what hes charged with hed have been tried and fried in about three minutes during the great depression, even in the north. But thats neither here nor there. Tell it, Bill: You got a steak. Just imagine you got a porterhouse and no white lines in it at all. Now, what would you like to go along with it? Crispy potatoes! Now, you got mushrooms. You can smell it, cant you? Smell the potatoes? Smell the mushrooms! Sauteed! MMM, boy! Huh? All right, now, Im going to present it to you, right? But, I dont get a plate. I take the garbage can lid, and I turn it upside down! After taking it off the garbage can, I take your steak, your potatoes, your sauteed mushrooms, and I give it to you! Not too appetizing, is it? Its in the presentation. Thats how she brought you here, on a garbage can lid! And thats just what Harper Lee did with chapter 23. She crescendos along using other literary means throughout the book showing rather than telling, then all of a sudden... IN YO FACE! The mask is ripped off, and all her views on everything are in front of you, stark naked, with Atticus acting as spokesman. He doesnt break the fourth wall since Jem is asking questions, but he might as well have; that section is clearly intended for the readers edification. The moral instruction is more ambiguous in the rest of the book because everything is seen through the eyes of Scout, an innocent child. Even the courtroom scene which contains one of the best speeches Ive ever read gets away with its moralizing due to the nature of the situation, but the living room chat in chapter 23? Not so much. Its just a minor annoyance because the change in tone and technique is a little jarring once I realize whats going on. She starts to sneak it in there, but its easily identifiable rather quickly. But enough about that. This book is still fantastic. I love the setting, and some of the imagery. Its also very well crafted and everything fits together all the way through to the end. A major benefit is that Scouts interpretation of events going on around her makes those events hilarious. The side stories add color no pun intended to an already rich tale. E.g.: The kid who was locked in the furnace room and forgotten during Sunday school telling her eventual rescuers that she didnt want to play Shadrach anymore. Ingenious. From what I understand a lot of these anecdotes are things that actually happened to Harper Lee. I wonder which ones are real and which are complete fiction, but I dont think theres any way to find out for sure. It was neat to find out that the character of Dill was based on Lees reallife childhood friend Truman Capote. He had given Lee the same treatment in his own novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms, and I suppose she was returning the favor. Atticus parenting style is most admirable. Its a shame its fiction, and my attempts to copy it with my own nieces and nephews sometimes fall flat. Well, the kids might still get the point, but it doesnt go anywhere near as smoothly as it does in the book. Course, Im nowhere near as eventempered as Atticus, so that plays a part as well. If I came across a Bob Ewell spitting in my face, Im pretty sure wed rumble. Turning the other cheek is not something I do very well, though I admire people who can manage it. One thing I did appreciate is Atticus compromising his standards at the end of the book when Sheriff Tate convinces him to let the Boo Radley matter lie right where it is. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Tell it, Heck! . As much as I love Atticus, I must confess he lives in a fantasy world. He insists on believing the best of everyone, and his children nearly died because of it. Optimism is great, but not when it causes you to deny reality. If someone tells me hes going to get me, it behooves me to be prepared for the possibility that hes going to try just that. Since Go Set a Watchman has come out, Atticus is now the winner of the most ironic line award when he tells Jem The Ku Kluxs gone, itll never come back. I never paid much attention to this line in previous readings even though I knew Atticus was wrong, but I sure picked up on it this time given what I know about Atticus future. Every time I read this I want to get a copy of a Rover Boys book, and two of the Seckatary Hawkins books, Stoners Boy: A Seckatary Hawkins Mystery and The Gray Ghost: A Seckatary Hawkins Mystery, but theyre a little expensive and I have so many other books I need to read. The Rover Boys are on the Gutenberg Project website since theyre over 100 years old, but reading it on the computer is no fun; I want a real book. Granddaddy had some of them when he was a kid, so they might be at the farm. It would be quite a treat to read those, but they might also be long gone. As for Seckatary Hawkins, Ill bite the bullet on that one day. I want to read them because these are things Jem, Scout, and Dill read. They were also very important to Harper Lee as a child, so important that she sent a signed first edition of To Kill a Mockingbird to Robert Schulkers the Seckatary Hawkins author with an inscription saying how much she enjoyed them. Atticus says Seckatary Hawkins as the author of The Gray Ghost, but it turns out Seckatary is a character in the book. That had me quite confused for a while, but its possible Seckatary was also a pseudonym when these first came out. I understand why literary types love this book because theres a lot of literary stuff in it. Themes, cultural references, etc. I also understand why sensitive types would just as soon it go away because its not for the faint of heart. It tackles some tough issues and a rather ugly side of American history. I think everyone should look at those things from time to time, and this book is a good way of doing that because its so well written. Its a joy to read in spite of its subject matter. Check it out if you think you can handle it. 71915 update: If youre into audiobooks, I strongly suggest the one read by Sissy Spacek; its fantastic. 71510: An excellent book; Ive read it thrice. It gives a fantastic picture of life in the Depression South, and shows how life isnt always fair. Atticus is a great character, though he gets a tad preachy a couple of times towards the end. I love his childrearing style, though, and actually try to emulate it when dealing with my nephew and nieces if they hit me with difficult questions. Another thing about the book is that its very wellwritten with a dry, comic style that kept me engaged. I would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good turn of phrase, and enjoys a good story as well.
Warning: As always, I try to stay relatively spoiler free. But it doesnt hurt to proceed with caution. Okay, okay, I think Im in love. This book was AMAZING. And I dont say that lightly. I know that, as far as book bloggers go, I am very easy to please and I probably give out way more fivestar ratings than I should if I want people to take my judgment on bookish matters seriously. But I would give this book eleven stars if I could. In a nutshell, ILLUMINAE follows Kady and Ezra as they escape the destruction of an illegal mining colony by hitching a ride with the Alexander and her fleet. However, the company that attacked the mining colony, unwilling to let any witnesses survive, pursues the fleeing ships for months. Matters worsen when a strange illness breaks out on one of the ships and the malfunctioning Artificial Intelligence takes drastic measures to prevent its spread. But the story is much much more than that, so obviously I need to explain to you why I love this book so much I would pry it out of the hands of a crying baby if I had to haha, ahem, just kiddingI would never be that mean to a baby...probably. AIDEN. I. Am. In. Love. With. AIDEN. Although he is a computer AIDEN stands for Artificial Intelligence Defense Analytics Network, he is more than just an amalgamation of algorithms and code. Whether it is his programing or his damaged hardware, his thought processes transcend binary into poetry. There is something so tragic and pathetic about the way he falls for Kady. Actually, theres something so tragic and pathetic about the way he processes the world in general. And when I say pathetic, Im speaking in terms of pathos rather than ridiculousness. He may be one of the main antagonists, but he does not see himself as an aggressor. Always he tries to act in the best interests of the majority, and he constantly justifies and evaluates his decisions. His programing may be cold and sterile, supposedly devoid of human feeling, but there is still something so distinctly moving when he asks himself, Am I not merciful? His thoughts, both in wording and presentation, are works of art, and I daresay he is more human in the end than most of the humans on the Alexander. I think he is hands down one of my favorite characters of ever, and I will probably talk about him so much over the coming year that you will want to duct tape my mouth shut and throw me out the airlock before the end of it. Sorry, not sorry. The Phobos. I actually felt a little misled here because one of the blurbs on the jacket mentioned zombies and I was like, Ooh, yay, zombies. Except they arent zombies, not really. Granted, the people effected by the virus behave a bit like the zombies in The Walking Dead in that they are attracted by sound. But Phobos victims are basically just uber psychotic people. Extremely terrifying, extremely violent, extremely psychotic people. And they are far scarier and far more dangerous than mere zombies. So Im totally not disappointed. As Phobos progresses through their systems, they become increasingly unreasonable, paranoid, and violent. But they retain enough of their intelligence and enough of their humanity to make them far worsemore awful and more tragic. And if you read the book, youll understand why I will always fight panic every time I hear someone say, Dont look at me. There is probably something really deep and symbolic about the Phobos victims behavior, but Im far too busy donning my hazmat suit and barricading myself in my closet to analyze this aspect of the book any further. Kady and Ezra. The story literally begins on the day Kady and Ezra break up. Talk about poor timing. And its fascinating to see where they go from therehow the tumultuous circumstances affect their strained relationship, and how the big, awful things around them help the two to see the small, awful things they have done to each other along the way. Normally Im not a huge fan of romance, but when it comes to Kady and Ezrayeah, I ship it. Also, Kady is a skilled hacker with more than her fair share of sass, and I want to be her when I grow up. Unique Format. As much as I was excited about the formatting of the novel, I was a little dubious for first the first two hundred pages or so. Maybe I was reading too quickly. Maybe it was that the narrative just felt a little different, like I was on the outside looking in. But I struggled to ground myself in the characters heads, and there were times I felt a little vague on the technicalities of the action, like maybe I had missed something important. I sometimes feel this way when Im reading books in FrenchI understand French, but its also not my mother tongue, so theres a bit of a mental lag. Despite my initial mild confusion, I did find myself getting more and more and MORE invested as the story progressed. Now, having finished the book, I can tell you I am entirely sold on this form of storytelling. Its not something I would read all the time because Im fairly certain most authors couldnt pull it off. Its also a style that doesnt lend itself to every story idea out there. But in this case, I dont think any other method would have fit ILLUMINAE quite so wellany other form of narration would have robbed the climax of its power. Woes and Whatnot. Nevertheless, I did have some qualms about ILLUMINE. First of all, this book is censored. All the major swear words are blacked out as a part of the story. And I like what that says about the culture in ILLUMINAE, that awful things can happen and violence can be presented, but God forbid we cuss. On top of that, its also an excellent example of the way censorship backfires. Blacking out or not, there was never a moment where I was unclear what the intended swear word was. Blacking out the vulgar words only draws the eye and the mind to them, thus completely defeating the point. Or maybe that was the point. That being said, there was a good deal of swearing in ILLUMINAE, and while strong swearing doesnt generally bother me enough to make me stop reading, it does make me a little more squeamish about recommending the book to just anyone and everyone. I would rather not sully the virgin minds of innocent younglings. ILLUMINAE also packs a significant amount of innuendo and general crassness. To be perfectly honest, I was planning to give this book a lower star rating for that very purpose because I think the story could have been told just as effectively with significantly less swearing and innuendo. When I give a book five stars, I see it as my giant stamp of approvalthat I will shove this book in the face of anyone who listens. But I also want to be responsible about the books I shove into peoples faces. Which explains why I was initially hesitant. The Ending. So, why did I give ILLUMINAE five stars if Im such a grandma about the language? Im glad you asked that question. I loved the ending. I loved the ending so much I almost cried because it was so beautiful. And I am not the type of person to get emotional over beauty, at all. I just dont. But there are no words for how wonderful the ending was. I know that people often say something like, This story took my breath away, and they generally mean that as a figure of speech. So let me clarify. I literally had to keep reminding myself to breathe for the last two hundred pages or so. This book was so good I could have asphyxiated. It was prefect and intense and mindboggling, and I havent felt so completely blown away by or invested in an ending since I read Enders Game. I cannot stress enough how wellwritten and unique ILLUMINAE is, how authentic it feels, how it carries such a big punch my poor little heart is still bruised. Both in formatting and in story, ILLUMINAE is a work of art. If I could, I would buy fifty million copies to line my walls as decoration. Obviously the sequel, GEMINA, cannot come out quickly enough.
Initial Impressions 12216: 3.5 stars Well, that was a fun and cheeky ending! Very clever and lots of fun. Unfortunately, I had a lot of issues up until then. This book was the least mysterioussuspenseful. I was totally bummed that I didnt have as many omg or wtf moments as I had in the first two books. Book two was just out of control with crazy moments and RETRIBUTION kind of took a turn... There was a lot going on in this book but things started to feel way more farfetched. I mean, were dealing with possible paranormal, possible scifi, possible mindmessing, but things started to really stray here, I think. Here are some spoilery thoughts: Noah was missing for like 70 of the book so that was a bummer. I wasnt in love with him to start BUT I did like his rapport with Mara and they had a nice balance. I also was totally lost with all of the Horizons stuff... Well, not LOST but it felt a bit too far removed from the feel of the first two books and it really wasnt doing anything for me. End spoilers! This was also incredibly violent and gory. I mean, it doesnt really turn me off but I was like HOLY COW, things are getting intense and that also started to carry me away from the logic and believability. Maras body count started to get plain ridiculous and the scene with the EYE? shudder When it comes down to it, RETRIBUTION did provide a lot of big questions for me. My issue was that I wasnt a big fan of how those answers came to be. I did like what the answers were but I wished things had played out a little differently to get there. Some scenes felt unnecessary and overdone when something simpler could have happened. It was paranormal, it was science, and yet it was neither. I was sadly not super impressed with the conclusion to the series but I was left on a high note with the very ending of the book itself. I wished parts in the beginning of RETRIBUTION had been more condensed and maybe played out a little differently. Overall, the series was fun but felt a little too dramatic to me when it could have been more suspenseful. The suspense and mystery was absolutely GREAT but I wanted so much more of it in the last book. Full review as originally posted on The Book Addicts Guide 2816: RETRIBUTION was a very weird case for me in that the entire book was actually a bit lacking for me but the ending was so clever and very fun! It actually left me on a good note with the series which was nice because I was kind of frustrated with the overall feel of this book, especially as a series conclusion. It sort of felt like it should have been the sophomore slump you so often see in trilogies except this happened in the last book instead. Very strange! RETRIBUTION was the least mysterioussuspenseful for me. There was a lot of action and some straight up I cant believe heshe just did that moments but it felt more like shock value than actual suspense. I was totally bummed that I didnt have as many omg or wtf moments as I had in the first two books. Book two was just out of control with crazy moments and RETRIBUTION kind of took a turn... There was a lot going on in this book but things started to feel way more farfetched. I mean, were dealing with possible paranormal, possible scifi, possible mindmessing, but things started to really stray here, I think. Without spoiling anything, I will note that there seemed to be a major character shift which really threw me off. There are new characters who gain more spotlight and other characters who end up moving to the backburner or are completely physically absent for large chunks of the book. It kind of screwed up the dynamic for me and just plain felt odd to do in the last book when relationships are solidifying and answers are finally happening. I was also not impressed with the new settings and scenery change. Again, it felt like the sophomore slump since that so often happens to me in book two even though this was the last book in the trilogy. I just really didnt like the turn the book took and I felt like an inordinate amount of time was spent in this new setting with this new concept. I really felt like things could have been wrapped up quicker  or just differently all together  and the story could have continued with more suspense or crazy answers. When it comes down to it, RETRIBUTION did provide a lot of big questions for me. My issue was that I wasnt a big fan of how those answers came to be. I did like what the answers were but I wished things had played out a little differently to get there. Some scenes felt unnecessary and overdone when something simpler could have happened. It was paranormal, it was science, and yet it was neither. I was sadly not super impressed with the conclusion to the series but I was left on a high note with the very ending of the book itself. I wished parts in the beginning of RETRIBUTION had been more condensed and maybe played out a little differently. Overall, the series was fun but felt a little too dramatic to me when it could have been more suspenseful. The suspense and mystery was absolutely GREAT but I wanted so much more of it in the last book. SERIES THOUGHTS Mara Dyer was a lot of fun and really did keep me on the edge of my seat! Im glad I ended up reading all of these backtobacktoback because I would have lost a lot of details if I had waited. The second book was definitely the most thrilling and twisty for me and I really wish the third book had continued on that pace. It was definitely a bit crazy but it also started to become a bit too wild for me in the sense that I wasnt quite believing it anymore. I kind of felt like Michelle Hodkin was trying to combine too many things all into one series. There are some series The Raven Cycle comes to mind where the books blur the lines between genres and you dont end up falling into any one specific category. I feel like thats what Mara Dyer should have been for me and it almost was, but things started to fall apart once the answers started coming into play. The answers to the mysteries did resolve things but I wasnt a big fan of how we got there. The romance was definitely a lot of fun and I loved the balance between Mara and Noah! They played off of each other nicely and their opposition really made them a good pair! I wasnt wholly sold on the romance the way some readers are. There was definitely chemistry there and I dont know if it was because I was listening to the audiobook but I could have used a bit more development of the feelings before the whole falling in love thing. BUT I do get it in the long run! I absolutely loved the humor in these books. Lots of sarcasm, quips, banter, and jokes based on pop culture. I love how every day humor really brings characters alive and Michelle Hodkin did an amazing job with that! Although I wasnt totally satisfied with some of the plot developments, I think Michelle Hodkin does an amazing job at character development. I feel like I got a really good sense of who everyone was and Michelle Hodkin really let each personality shine! Overall, I was hoping for a bit more suspense and mindmessing! Each book definitely had its moments but it didnt quite seem consistent throughout the series. I also really enjoyed how thing wrapped up but I wasnt a big fan of how book three got there. It was a solid series, though, and I definitely want to pick up the Noah POV thats coming out in 2017! I actually feel like I have the potential to enjoy it more than this one... Im pretty excited for it!
I loved the second book! The first one was good, but this was awesome. I loved seeing in detail the culture of District 12 and all the other districts. The book did a great job of fully growing the characters from the previous installment, making Katniss more likable and more caring, and also a little smarter. You could see the pieces slowly coming together, but it wasnt until the end that everything made complete sense. I cant wait for the next installment, but the ends were tied up well so that while cliffhangereque, its not horrific for the wait. I also really liked all the new characters and how no one is as they seem...I really cant wait to see what President Snow does in the next book, hes a truly wonderful villain. Full Review: It has been six months since Peeta and Katniss defied the government and were both crowned victor of The Hunger Games. Six months where things have achieved some sense of normalcy. Katniss family and Peeta now live in the victors village with Haymitch and they are now, more then ever before, an extended family. Katniss still hunts and is uncertain how things are with Gale, there was a tentative kiss, but that could mean anything...But now the tour of the Districts is upon them and Katniss has a rather terrifying visit from President Snow. There is disquiet and rumors of rebellion and Katniss must quell these uprisings with her overwhelming public displays of affection to Peeta to prove once again to the world that she and Peeta are not revolutionaries but two kids so in love they didnt understand the meaning of their actions. But it is obvious that the actions of two kids can not make up for the horrors that people have suffered at the hands of the capital, not even the prospect of Katniss and Peeta getting married can put out the fire that has been lite under these people. The only questions remains...with this year being the 75th anniversary of The Hunger Games, the thrid ever quarter quell...how can the Capital make Katniss pay for what she has done? While I enjoyed the first book in Suzanne Collins series it really did not grip me like Catching Fire did. I think this is down to two distinct factors, more of a glimpse into the post apocalyptic society that is Panem and character growth. In the first book, while I loved what we saw of District 12, it just wasnt enough, we were too quickly taken away to the candy coated world of the Capital, which I dont really like, except as a contrast to the lives in the Districts. While I can see the reasoning for Collins doing this in the first book, seeing as each District is kept compartmentalized from each other, I really wanted to know more. But in a book written in first person narration, we can only expect to know what Katniss knows, which at the beginning is not so much, seeing as she lives within this compartmentalized society. Once she wins though she becomes something more to society, and Im not talking about as a rallying point for a revolution, Im talking about being above those she grew up with in her District, but also being not on the same footing as those in the Capital. Even more so because in District 12 there are only three others like her, but three others who when combined with the other past victors are an oddity to this society, but eventually they become something so much more. So with her new found other status she starts to learn more and therefore we learn more. We get to see the other Districts, though not in as much detail as I was initially expecting within the context of the Victory Tour, it was enough to show Panem more completely. Also later on through Katniss interactions with the other previous victors we learn more about each district, where the seafood comes from, where electronics come from, and by the availability of these goods the uprisings can be charted. Its a whole fascinating structure of Districts as basically serfdoms, and I just cant get enough of it! This is what I was looking for in the first book and I finally got it delivered! But what I find most important is the character development. In the first book Katniss herself as such an autonomous little person, she has her few people who matter to her, but she has basically shut out the world around her. Again, this was on purpose, but she really kept infuriating me with her obliviousness to the world around her, her inability to see that she was loved and respected by those near her, Peeta in particular. When she won, when she finally grasped that the game she was playing meant something entirely different to Peeta, a wall finally cracked, something actually broke through to her. Therefore the Katniss we see in Catching Fire is a little more mature, a little more willing to let people in, a little more willing to expand her family circle and help others. Also a little more willing to fight for those she loves, and not just Prim this time, but for Peeta and Gale and for the past victors. She has forged alliances and not ones that will be easily broken when the time comes, but ones that mean something, ones that she will be willing to risk the wrath of the government for. She had to come to this realization of the world around her in order for her to become the person she needed to be in order to embrace revolution. You can not fight for something you cant grasp. When all you see or feel is that which affects you, then you are never going to hoist the banners, sound the trumpet and fight for the greater good. Katniss has become an empathic being, as have others, even some of the Capitals residents, and as an empathetic person I can relate far better to someone who feels the same and is not so self reliant and walled in. This is a Katniss I can like as well as admire. And who knows...empathy could easily be the emotion that could end these games forever...
No one deserves you like I do. No one sees you like I do. No one understands you the way I do. No one makes your heart beat like I do. He presses his palm against my heart. And no one else deserves to be inside you if they cant get there through here first. Cue tears and inaudible screams of feelings O.M.G. O.M.G. O.M.G. O.M.G. O.M.G. Im sorry, but I somehow cant stop saying that expression after reading this book. I mean, wow...Just WOW! I cant believe that Colleen Hoover has managed to do it againeffortlessly. I dont think Ive ever hated a book of hers, and honestly, I dont think I ever can. Every CoHo book just brings me to that book high that I absolutely loved being in. Before this, I just finished a book that I equally loved, and I cant express how much its such a gift to be reading two of my favorite books back to back. I am beyond happyheck, I am beyond myself. I cant even think straight because I just love everything right now, all thanks to this book. AMAZEBALLS! But in the end, I think theres only one thing perfect to say about Confess: O.M.G. Its amazing how much distance one truth can create between two people. Me during most of the read: PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT THE SECRET IS!!! I NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH!!! I CANT TAKE IT WITH THE HINTS ANYMORE! Yes, I was a monster. CoHo just creates the perfect plot twists and surprises, but of course, she has to torture her readers on what it is, and I just lost it with this bookin a good way, of course. I just loved how CoHo managed to intrigue me every single time, and of course, this piece of her did not fail! Some secrets should never turn into confessions. I know that better than anyone. I dont think Ive ever been uniquely fascinated with confessions until now. Before starting this, there was a note by CoHo that all confessions in the book are all true and were submitted anonymously by her readers. There were quite a few times Ive been intrigued by a confession, while some made me ache in the chest, and some made me smile. With this, Im grateful that those who sent in their confessions had the courage to share them, whether bad or good. Im scared Ill never stop comparing my life without him to how my life was when I was with him. One element I superbly loved about this book is the art. Id like to consider myself as someone who greatly appreciates art, but I wouldnt go to the extent of calling myself an enthusiast. But after reading this book and seeing all the beautiful paintings that CoHo managed to incorporate in this, I was overwhelmed with beauty. I think the confessions add an element of realness to your paintings that cant be found in other art. I definitely dont regret buying the hard copy, and every penny spent on it was entirely worth it. Also, I just have to say that Confess is one of the most physically beautiful books with a very engaging cover that I have ever seen. Here is one of my favorite paintings: Im in love with every single painting in this book. A big thanks to Danny OConnor for bringing to life Owens artworks. One big KUDOS to you, good sir! My mother says there are people you meet and get to know, and then there are people you meet and already know. I feel like Owen is the latter. Our personalities seem to complement each other, like weve known one another our whole lives. Okay, now lets go to the two main characters with the same middle name: Auburn Mason Reed  Owen Mason Gentry...OKAY IM SORRY BUT I CANT CONTAIN MYSELF! I LOVE THEM BOTH LIKE I LOVE MY OTHER FAVORITE OTPsand that says a lot! Can I just cue my tears again??? I just seriously loved them together. I am a sucker for soulmates we meet again we are destiny fate brought us together type of crap AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED AUBURN AND OWEN BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST THAT. I try to tell myself again that this is nothing more than a coincidence. Her showing up at my doorstep tonight. Her connecting with my art. Her having the same middle name as I do. That could be fate, you know. I just loved their relationship, and how simple it has been for them to connect with one another. I lived for their witty banters and sweet exchanges, but I died slowly inside whenever they were brought apart. Lies, confessions, and the truth: this book has been a mixture of these. But these three were present because of one thing: sacrifice. Both Owen and Auburn has decided to push themselves to the limit and even act beyond to their accordance all for the people they value and love in life. In the end, it was all selflessness. Selflessness. It should be the basis of every relationship. If a person truly cares about you, theyll get more pleasure from the way they make you feel, rather than the way you make them feel. These two shook my shipper heart, and I wouldnt have it any other way. I dont want you to remember what it feels like when Im inside you. I want you to remember how it feels when I look at you. I want you to remember how your heart reacts every time I kiss you. I want you to remember my hands, and how they cant stop touching you. And I need you to remember that anyone can make love. But Im the only one who deserves to make love to you. He kisses me like Im his canvas. He grabs both of my hands and intertwines his fingers with mine. His forehead meets mine when his kiss comes to an end. And of course, a big appreciation to my new book boyfriend: Owen Mason Gentry who makes me OMG to no end! I loved this guy beyond the worlds of the universe. He makes my heart paint a picture of how much I admire him. Everything about him is downright swoonworthy, and its no surprise why Auburn loved him just as well. His talent, I think, was the one that won me over. Well, that and his selflessness. I want to paint you, he says, breaking the silence. His voice is full of all the confidence I lack. Apparently my heart is worried I forgot it existed, because its giving me a loud and fast reminder of its presence in my chest. I do my best to swallow without his noticing. You want to paint me? I ask in an embarrassingly weak voice. He nods slowly. Yes. I smile and try to play off the fact that his words just became the most erotic thing a guy has ever said to me. O.M.G., you make me OMG! His initials are very appropriate for the way hes making me feel right now. I want to whisper, OMG, over and over.  Right on, Auburn! My sentiments exactly! Tonight, everyones focus is on my art, but my focus is on her. Shes the most interesting piece in this entire room. Again, wow...JUST WOW! I loved Confess, and I dont know how CoHo did it again, but I think she is one brilliant author! Coho, you take me to the clouds with your books, and I absolutely am grateful for that! You deserve all the love and appreciation you get! Just, thank you for this. OMG! I ALSO LOVE ADAM SO MUCH! AND HIS CONNECTION WITH OWEN! I WAS LIKE OMG!! OKAY IM FANGIRLING AGAIN TO THE EXTREMES! BUT YEAH LOVED IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT! I love you so much. His voice is breathless and full of fear. Ill love you forever. Even when I cant. My tears fall harder at his words. And Ill love you forever. Even when I shouldnt. Im afraid if I listen to my heart once, Ill never figure out how to ignore it again. And listening to my heart, it says that I give this book 5 stars!!!
Review originally posted on my book blog here As a fairytale retelling with a cyborg Cinderella, and set in New Beijing, Cinder promised to deliver a story containing some of my favorite themes. Ive had high hopes for this one so when I saw a contest for an ARC, I made sure I signed up. This review is based on an ARC copy I won from the publisher. The Premise: Its now 126 T.E. and in the teeming city of New Beijing, Linh Cinder is a talented mechanic who works out of her stall at the Weekly Market. While shes a teenaged girl, not your typical store owner, shes also a cyborg, and thus the property of her stepmother Adri, who uses Cinders income to run the household and keep her two daughters Pearl and Peony in relative comfort. Adri has no love for Cinder, and the feeling is mutual. Cinders life is not easy, but even the limited peace she has is gone when the plague comes to her home. While things are at their lowest point with her stepfamily, Cinder finds herself entangled in international politics and in the life of Prince Kai, heir to the Eastern Commonwealth. Somehow this is all tied to her own past and the ruthless Lunarians poised to take over the planet. My Thoughts: This story starts off very well. It begins with Cinder at her usual stall in the market, a space that is obviously her own. I loved the way Cinders skill as a mechanic and her ostracization as a cyborg are incorporated with the sights and sounds of the New Beijing marketplace. When Prince Kai arrives, incognito and carrying an android for Cinder to work on, he has no idea that Cinder is part machine. Cinder, faced with a cute boy that every girl in the city has a crush on, isnt eager to reveal something that shes vilified for on a constant basis. It was a great opening scene and the tension of secrets between the two characters added something to the whole meeting. Another great dose of drama is added when there is an outbreak of letumosis nearby, and the reader is made aware of this deadly and horrifying disease and how its victims are treated. That was all on the first chapter. I was happy with just the thought of a story that contained Cinder, the prince, and letumosis, but the story becomes much larger in scope. Beyond Cinder and her stepfamily whom we are introduced to soon after Cinder and the prince, are worldwide machinations. It isnt long before Cinders world is upended and she is involved in a frantic seesaw between trying to save a loved one from letumosis and trips to the palace where she continues to run into Prince Kai and discovers surprising things about both herself and the Lunarians. All the while, Kai has his own problems. His father has the plague too, and the diabolically evil Queen Levana wants the seize power through marriage to an inexperienced young monarch. I really liked Cinders character. She is a girl who doesnt have many supporters but she makes the best of what she has. She knows how to fix things, she has a realistic attitude, and shes rather scrappy when things go south. I adored all the little reminders of her cyborg status like readouts and her leg compartment that liberally peppered the story. Kai struck me as a generally nice guy trying to do the right thing under trying circumstances. There are brief sections of this book told from his point of view. Overall, hes not as well fleshed out as Cinder, but his frustration at his fathers sickness and the way the Lunarians are exploiting the situation is palpable. Theres an obvious intent for there to be a romance between the two characters but the romance is not quite there yet. I had the impression that there was an instant like between Kai and Cinder, but thats as far as it goes. With the weight of the world on their shoulders and with moments in each others company, it was a stretch to believe Kai would have any interest in Cinder being at his ball. Thankfully, the book didnt try to sell me on a fullblown love between the two, which saves things somewhat, but it does skirt on the edges of disbelief without really going over. I think that the real romantic development is being saved for later books. I hope that the characters can spend more time with each other before the romance really happens. Actually, a lot of this story felt like it was set up for later books. There are several ongoing threads that deal with Cinders past and her true identity which obviously wont be resolved in this book. Unfortunately, there was a bit of frustration with having Cinder kept ignorant until the books climax. I could see where the story was manipulated there. I think that with the intent for this to be the series, it also necessitated that the Cinderella formula wasnt adhered to in Cinder and the introduction of the ultimate bad guys  the Lunarians, in particular their evil queen. As bad guys go, I much preferred Cinders stepmother, who misdirects her anger and grief at her losses toward Cinder. Andi was a villainess with a motivation I understood. The Lunarian queen is just felt evil for no reason. Yes, fairytale bad guys are usually like that, and taken from that perspective, she is typical, but I wish Cinder could have stuck more to the original than it did. I also was hoping to have a better sense of place in this story than I did. Other than the marketplace introduced all the way at the start of the book, there was little to show that the story was set in New Beijing. The only thing to indicate where everyone lived was their names. Even while preparing for the ball, the ballgowns sounded western: satin and tulle, big and fluffy, rather than silk and embroidered. I felt like the author had a missed opportunity in not making New Beijing a presence in the narrative. Okay, so I have my complaints about this story, but none of them were deal breakers. There were things that I think affected my enjoyment of the middle part of the story, even though Cinder is well written and flowed well. I just found the middle part of the story not as compelling as the beginning and the end. There were parts that dragged because I felt like I could see what was going on behind the curtain. The ending was a good one though  it sealed my like of Cinders character and I enjoyed how the fairytale elements showed up. Were left with plenty to look forward to in the sequels. Cinder continues with Scarlet inspired by Little Red Riding Hood, Cress Rapunzel, and Winter Snow White. I will be interesting to see how the series plans to keep Cinders story within the frame of stories meant to be about other characters. Overall: I loved the premise of a cyborg Cinderella so much that I wanted this story to really wow and excite me the way the premise did. The execution was good, but it didnt thrill me like I wanted to be thrilled. The beginning and the end were great, but the middle suffered under the weight of being set up for a series and I had several qualms with the setting, romance, and antagonists. In the end, I liked Cinder, but it wasnt a home run. Id recommend this with reservations. Other links: Glitches  a short story that prequels Merissa Meyers CINDER
A powerful and evocative read. It has been a good 24 hours since I last read the book, and I still cant get it out of my head. Its pretty much plaguing my mind every chance it gets, pouncing its awful reality on my brain like a headache I could not easily get rid off. This book ended me. In the truest sense of the word. Colleen hoover bared her soul with this one. This is the Colleen Hoover I fell in love with. This is the Colleen hoover hitting it where it hurts the most. This is Colleen Hoover not just telling a story for entertainment but so much more. This is digging deeper. This is flaw and perfection. This book hits home. When you literally drop everything youre reading just to read this one book. That constant curiosity and want gnawing at you. That feeling when it is all you think about every goddamn hour waiting for a minute, just one fucking minute you could spend with it. Waiting for unadulterated time, and actually being thankful for traffic or for idle time because you can read a page or two. It is really hard to contain ones emotions when you just wanted to explode and tell every single soul you come across with how erratic your heart is beating, how theres this quesy feeling down the recesses of your being. The adrenaline rush., my heartbeat in 140minute. Gahhh that was what happened to me, I was so attached to it, I practically couldnt function well. There are so many things going on inside my head, Im not even sure where do I get the energy to write this review because I feel like I am so emotionally exhausted. Boy I had to compose myself, I had to pace my room and contemplate about what I just read. It was as powerful as it was raw. It was as heartbreaking as it was real. Hats off to people who have read this and not one bit messed up, because I for one cannot deal with all the rush of emotions Im having all at once. I have so many things to say and I am afraid I may not be able to say everything there is to say. So let me just compose myself a little more. Give me 10 seconds more. You still there? Okay good. You ready to talk about it? To be completely honest, Im not. First off, I heard few friends who didnt like it. Which I completely understand. There is no one book that is for everyone. I guess it is just a matter of how much of yourself can relate to the story. And to tell you, this book hits home. Like it really nailed it where the wound had been and let it bleed anew. Im not one to go into details how much I related to this book. But this book gives you that bigger perspective, that sense of maturity of having to make an intelligent choice. God I wish I could say so much without giving anything away. Since Im always the one to give spoiler free reviews, I will try my best to give the book justice by not delving too much about the details of the book. Lets talk about the characters. There is Lily, a character I was able to relate in more ways than one. I loved how Colleen Hoover made her character reach out to readers, they may not have experienced that same thing her character went through, but she portrayed every woman faced with a predicament but was able to make choices that are selfless and intelligent. Her character was the one that made the biggest impact, she was someone who may have made wrong decisions along the way just like most of us but had conviction to stand by what is right. She was resilient and courageous and I adored Colleen Hoover for sharing such an amazing character. Then there is Ryle Kincaid, a man who has everything but is deeper than what he let on. His character was not hard to love. in fact his character was the one youll immediately fall for, until something happens gahhh I cant tell. And then there is Atlas, that guy from the past, to me he was perfect, to me he was the guy I wished I met or have my own version of. It is pretty obvious that I am Team Atlas from the very beginning. And of course I cant fail to mention Alyssa and Marshall, god I love those two!! So funny! They seriously make the book a little lighter. Colleen Hoover made flawed characters, she made characters that are relatable. She made her characters into this real individuals with demons they have to deal with day in and day out, this was the magic of this book, how it was able to transcend from the pages of a book into the real world. How you can very well imagine that there is someone who is actually just like them in this world. The only issue I had maybe was how every character looked gorgeous and perfect, maybe we could change that? Now lets tackle the whole story. I never read the blurb, I went to this book as blind as one could get. I have literally no idea what it was about when I started reading it, and again I am reminded that there is beauty in that. Not knowing what it was about, not knowing what to expect, not knowing where the story will take you. And I am so glad I didnt read the blurb, I am so glad my judgment was not tainted by what others thought about it. It was as pure as it could get. The story was a powerful one. It tackles heavy topics, something we should be talking about more, something we should not be afraid to read about, something we should challenge ourselves to understand more, something we should not shy away from. This book sent a message, loud and clear. Breaking the pattern, before the pattern breaks you. I had goosebumps whilst reading this book. Not only because I was able to relate to some extent but also because this was a bold and brave move by Colleen Hoover. Not many can write what theyve been through, but Colleen Hoover made this book so significant and relevant you cannot miss the message she was trying to send across. It Ends With Us was different and mature. It was a sad book yet a satisfying one. It was as heartbreaking yet as surreal. It was real life magnified and detailed, it was real life painted in a different light. It was a book everyone should read, not just because it is loved by many but there is a very important message that you could learn from. This book is an emotional rollercoaster, something you thought you are ready for but as it progresses through its loops and big drops, you will realize why the hell did you even ride in the first place, but after all the scare and the heartstopping moments you will learn how rewarding it is. That is exactly what I felt when I finished reading this book. Plethora of unwanted emotions came rushing in, and I could not contain it, it felt like my heart was going to burst, I literally had a hard time breathing, it touched sensitive topics that I would rather forget but I took the plunge, I was all in, and couldnt be more glad that I did. So Im gonna stop here, drop everything and read this. You can thank me later. And oh please read until Authors Note. Hands down to Colleen Hoover! Thank you for being BOLD and BRAVE!
Suburban middle grade teacher Celeste Prices is undeniably beautiful, everyone can see that. Her husband is rich, hardworking, determined and most people think they are the perfect couple. Thats because no one knows Celestas secret, her singular sexual obsession for fourteen year old boys. After all this is the real reason she became a teacher and is working at Jefferson Jr. High. There are three main reasons people will try to avoid this book. Firstly the protagonist is not likeable, how could she be? Secondly, the sad truth is I found a lot of people tend to avoid Juvenalian satire; Im not entirely sure why but maybe they dont appreciate it or they forget to remember it is not an indication of the satirist persona. Lastly and probably most importantly, this book is disturbing; probably the most disconcerting book Ive ever read American Psycho held this place for a long time and I found myself having to put it down just to recover. So why read it? Tampa is a well written debut novel and arguably one of the most talked about novels at the moment. The reason its talked about is the subject it satirises; lets face it, this is a topic that is often never talked about because of its disturbing nature. A female sexual predator is something Ive never read in a book but this seems to works in Alissa Nuttings favour. I have to take a moment to talk about the subject matter because this is important. Young teenage boys all seem to have similar fantasies; an older woman, normally a teacher or a babysitter. Its a common sexual desire for a boy with their budding sexuality; the experienced, already developed older woman, but they dont realise just how destructive that can be on them. They have no idea how to separate their emotions from the sexual act and this is a slippery slope that can only lead to being hurt. Not to mention the emotional and psychological damage it can do to them. Then you have the discussion of sexual addiction being covered in this novel as well. Celeste Prices acts with sociopathic meticulousness; lying and manipulating everyone in order to get what she desires. Not just the people around her; she deludes herself as well, always trying to justify her actions. I think it was interesting how Alissa Nutting was able to look at the problems with this fantasy young boys have and how damaging it can be and at the same time have the reader think about sex addiction and how it effects the person. Tampa is written in the first person perspective of Celeste Prices so as a reader we get to see her trying to justify her actions to herself and the reader. Though as the reader we can see how off her justification is and maybe even remember times in our own life were we have tried justifying making stupid mistakes with similar lies. The thoughts and the desire that Celeste has to the fourteen year old boys is disgusting and are sure to make you feel sick, which is the reason I couldnt read this book in one sitting. In fact every time I put down the book, I worried that if I showed my wife any sort of affection that she might get the wrong idea. I found out later that she was worried that if she showed any affection, I might associate it with the book. So Im glad it was short and I didnt have to spend too much time reading it. Im sure my poor wife got sick of me wanting to discuss this subject matter with her, its not an easy topic but this novel makes you want to talk about it with someone. She tells me a similar thing happened in Glee where one of the teenage boys was molested by his babysitter when he was young and his classmates thought it wasnt that bad as its every boys fantasy. The fact that you cant help wanting to talk about this novel and the themes would make this book the perfect choice for a book club which scares me a lot. I hope and pray that this never becomes the next book club book at my local book club. I love the Mary Who? Book club and this is the best indie bookstore in Townsville but I am normally the only male and most of the other people are slightly older than me. This would be the most awkward book to discuss and because I have so much I can say about this novel it would feel really weird, so I hope that it never becomes the next pick for book club. This has been compared to Lolita and I can see why, the sexual predator and the satirical nature, but personally I think this comparison might do more harm than good. Being compared to a masterpiece like Lolita would put so much pressure on this book and I dont think it lives up to the beauty of Vladimir Nabokovs writing. I get why it is compared but I think it tackles different topics and they both should be analysed separately. Having said that it might be a good book to partner with Lolita if your book club has that kind of structure set up. Lastly I want to quickly talk about the covers because I think they are worth mentioning. In the UK and Australasia the cover is a pink shirt with a button hole. I love this cover, it is very suggestive and makes people look twice and it really suits the book. Apparently, in America, the black cover that I thought looked boring in comparison, is made from black velvet, which might give the same suggestive tones when you pick up the book rather than looking at it. Interesting choices and I think both seem to work really well but I prefer the buttonhole cover. I should warn people that this book contains graphical sex scenes which are ghastly and off putting, so this book is never going to be an easy read but this is a topic that needs to be discussed more and the book does this really well. I really enjoyed having read this book, but not really while reading it. Im surprised how much I wanted to talk about the subject, so I think Alissa Nutting achieved what she set out to achieve. I hope people read it soon; I look forward to discussing the book with others. This review originally appeared on my blog; 
3.5 stars What I expected from Summer Days and Summer Nights was twelve fluffy, shippy contemporary romance short stories. My expectations were not met. The stories herein do take place in summer, though some are not about summer. They do also have romances. However, a surprising number really arent fluffy at all, and many of them are genre fiction. Head, Scales, Tongue, Tail by Leigh Bardugo Its really weird reading a mostly contemporary story by Leigh Bardugo. Head, Scales, Tongue, Heart is somewhere on the paranormalmagical realism border. The storys a bit slow at first and a bit too fast to end, but overall I liked it. So far, with Bardugos published books and two of her short stories under my belt, her fantasy works much better for me personally. The characterization of the storys okay, but the plot resolution didnt make a ton of sense tbh. 35 The End of Love by Nina LaCour Though the premise of this story seems a bit unlikely who a loves geometry and b would sign up for a class theyve already taken in summer school just to have something to do, but it was so well done. Floras parents are getting divorced, and shes trying to deal with her life as she knew it falling apart. Though the divorce is at this point amicable, Floras emotionally compromised by the way the house they all built together is being sold off piece by piece. She finds some comforts in the arms of a crush. Adorable ff is adorable. 45 Last Stand at the Cinegore by Libba Bray Brays contribution to Summer Days and Summer Nights is horror. Its selfaware, postmodern horror of the style found in Whedons The Cabin in the Woods, though the plots are obviously different. The storys very clever, a send up of horror, including the inevitable romance. The plot and writing shine here, but the characters are eversoslightly generic, lining up with horror tropes. 3.55 Sick Pleasures by Francesca Lia Block Blocks fiction often doesnt work for me, and Sick Pleasure is no exception. This story is weird, about two groups of kids one girls, one boys who go clubbing and never interact until one of the boys asks the MC to dance one day. All of them are known only by initials. The couple breaks up, but the ending suggests they could get together again in the future. I didnt enjoy reading this one. 25 In Ninety Minutes, Turn North by Stephanie Perkins Its no surprise that Perkins story became my new favorite, since shes so great at ships and character. Of all the stories thus far, this ones the most characterfocused and one of the most romantic. Its also new adult fyi. Marigold Moon Ling returns to her hometown with the goal of convincing her exboyfriend North Drummond to move to Atlanta with her, because she thinks hes meant for more and she wants to rescue him from his current circumstances. The character names are the weakest link. The banter between Marigold and North is excellent, though tbh North could banter excellently with a wall so. Its very cute, and I would have a read a full book about them. 4.55 Souvenirs by Tim Federle Seriously why did no one warn me that so many of the stories in this collection werent happy? When you label the cover twelve love stories, Im expecting HEAs, goddammit. Federles contribution is on point with the summer theme and does involve love, but, as promised in the first line of the story, its the tale of a breakup. Then again, I can tolerate the breakup because its not exactly a ship of dreams. Its also not as funny as Federles middle grade series, so Souvenirs really didnt meet my expectations at all. 35 Inertia by Veronica Roth Another story that failed to meet my expectations. In this case, though, thats definitely a good thing. Its no secret that Roths Divergent series failed to please me. Surprisingly, Inertia, an eversoslightly science fiction story proved a vast improvement. Set in a world where science has advanced to allow for patients about to undergo likely fatal operations to sort of mind meld with friendsfamily to express their last thoughts. They meet up in shared memories. Here, the heroine gets the chance to make amends with her male best friend, estranged since a bad fight. The science is weak, seeming more like one of the trippier One Tree Hill episodes than the future, but the characters are welldrawn, the treatment of mental illness is good, and the romance is sweet. The season of the collection seems thrown in as an afterthought at the end to make the story work for this but whatever. 3.55 Love Is the Last Resort by Jon Skovron Not having read any Skovron, I had no expectations for this one. Love Is the Last Resort turned out to be a highlight. While not my favorite from a character standpoint, this one stands out in terms of cleverness and construction. Skovron has managed to tell a modern Shakespearean comedy set at a resort, a humorous comedy of errors and everyone pairing off at the end. As ever with short stories, I cant help thinking how delightful this could have been as a full novel, with the proper space for character development. As a short story, though, I find it a clever bit of craft. 45 Good Luck and Farewell by Brandy Colbert Surprisingly, Good Luck and Farewell is cute and shippy, though still much darker than I expected from this anthology. I say surprisingly not because Colbert doesnt have the talent, but because Pointe was not that sort of novel. Its nice to see more of her range in this short story. Good Luck and Farewell makes a nice companion to The End of Love. Here, the heroines cousin, whos been like a mother to her since the death of her actual mother, is moving away to California with her girlfriend. In dealing with this new loss, she meets a cute boy. Pierre doesnt fix Rahidas problems but he relates in a way that helps her take a new perspective. 4.55 Brand New Attraction by Cassandra Clare Huh. Something by CC that isnt Shadowhunters or remotely similar to HP. I hardly know how to process this. Actually, Brand New Attraction isnt bad. It lacks the pretentiousness of Shadowhunters. Its more like a YA Goosebumps with romance. Fun, though not strong on characterization. 35 A Thousand Ways This Could All Go Wrong by Jennifer E. Smith Color me completely flabbergasted. Ive read two Smith novels, and DNFed a third. I liked The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight enough to give it three stars, but I also had problems with it. I loathed with every fiber of my being The Geography of You and Me. This story, though, is adorable, almost bantery. Its not soaked in sentiment to the degree her novels are. Sure, theres some, but its that adorable burst of feelings as a crush turns into something more substantial. Theres no instalove, and both characters are genuinely lovely people. Smith establishes a believable connection, and I love the Autism representation in the story. Ill still be hesitant to pick up her full length novels, but Im quite impressed with this one, especially since it seems like it and the Perkins story may be the only fluffy, contemporary romances in the bunch. 4.55 The Map of Tiny Perfect Things by Lev Grossman What a nice place to end the collection. This ones mostly fluffy and does have a romance, though I cant say I ship it. The concept is, basically, Groundhog Day, but the voice is great, and I love the added concept of the map of perfect things. The inclusion of Flatland adds a lot, and Im ferociously glad that I actually got something out of reading Flatland in high school. The only weakness to this story lies in Margaret, who tbh goes to the manic pixie side of female characterization. The resolution was also cheesy as all get out, but overall a very strong story, and a rare one where I really think its best as a short story. 45 Conclusion So yeah, Summer Days and Summer Nights is actually a pretty good collection, but, gorgeous as its cover is, I dont think it markets quite right for what readers will find inside. Still, if you can get past the darker subject matter, its worth a read.
He also wouldnt say if he was a drug dealer or not. And he didnt even mention the gangbanging stuff. Does it matter thought? He didnt deserve to die. Well, holy crap. This book punched me in the gut. Repeatedly. I cried. Over and over. I cried reading it in my apartment. I cried reading it in the mall. I cried reading it in the dimly lit theatre before my movie began. You will feel angry reading this book. And you should. If you have experienced this, there will be the anger that comes from being part of an unjust shared experience. If you are privileged enough to have avoided this experience, like me, you should feel angry that this shit happens every day and yet we are adding names to the depressing list of unarmed people of color being murdered by the people who some of us were taught are there to protect. When I was a child, I was told to find a police officer if there was trouble. Others were taught how they needed to act and react to avoid getting killed. Corporate America dont bring jobs to our communities, and they damn sure aint quick to hire us. Then, shit, even if you do have a high school diploma, so many of the schools in our neighborhoods dont prepare us well enough...Our schools dont get the resources to equip you like Williamson does. Its easier to find crack than it is to find a good school around here. The first time I was really, truly aware of my privilege was embarrassingly late in life. I saw a cartoon that showed a race. The white man started down the track and had few obstacles in his path. The black man was positioned noticeably further behind with loads more obstacles keeping him back. This book is so important in that, among many other things, it highlights this issue. When your basic life circumstances put you so much further behind everyone else, it can be damn near impossible to catch up. Starr and her brothers are sent to a predominantly white school in an effort to help them navigate some of those obstacles on the track. Although they may be getting a better education than they would in their neighborhood, it presents an entirely new set of issues. Starr attends a party in her neighborhood and leaves with a childhood friend after a fight leads to gun fire. A cop pulls them over and shoots her unarmed friend. Along with the horror of seeing her friend murdered right in front of her, she must go back to her school and play a role. She has to watch what she says, lest her white friends think she is too ghetto. I should be used to my two worlds colliding, but I never know which Starr I should be. I can use some slang, but not too much slang, some attitude, but not too much attitude, so Im not a sassy black girl. I have to watch what I say and how I say it, but I cant sound white. Shit is exhausting. Everyone at her school just assumed that she would date the only other black student who wasnt a sibling of hers. They make comments that are racist without a second thought because Starr isnt like them. It was so uncomfortable to read. I frantically reflected back on some of the things that Ive said mindlessly as an ignorant teenager. I had no excuse. If I said anything as thoughtless as some of the things in this book, it can be blamed entirely on my privilege and ignorance, and I am ashamed. Im not apologizing for what I felt, I say. I dont care what your intention was, Hailey. That fried chicken comment felt racist to me. This point is so important. Words have meanings that go beyond their basic definitions, and raciallycharged language is just that  racist. Another good example from this book also said by white, blonde Hailey was the crack about an Asian character eating cat for Thanksgiving. I applaud Angie Thomas for addressing this, and I just hope that the people who need to hear it are reading this book. Hell, I hope everyone is reading this book. This book is a response to Black Lives Matter, and it is perfection. It is all of the things that make us human. It is gritty and dirty and violent and depressing and infuriating and hopeless and romantic and heartwarming and funny and brilliant and hopeful all at once. I didnt even think it was possible to encapsulate so many fighting emotions in the telling of one incredibly important story. God, I dont even know what to point out that stands out above the rest. Every page, every paragraph, every word is crucial to the incredible whole. If I had to pull something out, I would say that what I loved most were those tiny, beautiful glimpses into a strong, resilient community. I tense as footage of my neighborhood, my home, is shown. Its like they picked the worst parts  the drug addicts roaming the streets, the brokendown Cedar Grove projects, gangbangers flashing signs, bodies on the sidewalks with white sheets over them. What about Mrs. Rooks and her cakes? Or Mr. Lewis and his haircuts? Mr. Reuben? The clinic? My family? Me? Mr. Reuben remembers everyones order at his shop. Mrs. Rooks makes cakes that are unmatched in excellence. Mr. Lewis, grumpy though he can be, runs the barbershop. Starr and her family own a store where people dip in and out all day grabbing bags of chips, sodas, and any other convenience needs. All of these places and all of these people have the most incredible sense of community. I watch Foty Ounce help Mrs. Pearl. People around here dont have much, but they help each other out as best they can. Life has really screwed over a lot of people in this novel. Even the drug runners and gangbangers have stories. When your prospects are grim because you are a victim of circumstance and your family owes money and you feel as though youve been backed into a corner, desperation will win out. Despite that, the community comes together  to defend their own, to protest injustice, and to rebuild. All I can say is READ THIS BOOK. If the timely and critically important political statement isnt enough to get you scrambling to the nearest bookstore or library, then read it for the characters. I loved them. What a remarkable ensemble! Starrs parents are in my top three alltime favorite parental teams. I have something to add. Lord, bless my mom, and thank you that she went into her retirement fund and gave us the money for the down payment. Help us turn the basement into a suite so she can stay here sometimes. No, Lord, Daddy says. Yes, Lord, says Momma. No, Lord. Yes. No, amen! There is death. It is an unfair, enraging, and emotionally exhausting murder. It is so much more devastating when you see this happening in real life on TV and on your Facebook and Twitter feeds Every. Single. Day. There are protests in this book. There are riots. There is a mass of unquelled fury. BUT. There is also love. There is personal growth. There is the promise to keep fighting. There is determination. And there is hope. This book should be required reading for anyone who tries to speak over POC. For anyone who wants to erase the very real, excessive, and unnecessary deaths of unarmed black men and women. For anyone who overuses their All Lives Matter hashtags whilst simultaneously excusing the murders of these men and woman because of some real or perceived wrongdoing by the victim. As though falling in with the wrong crowd or making a poor life choice or even just being in the wrong damn place at the wrong damn time should be punishable by death. As if the crime of being black should be punishable by death. It may do nothing for the minds that have already been closed for good, but maybe, just maybe, it can pierce through and lead to a deeper understanding of this immensely complicated issue. This is a heavy book about heavy things. I expect a degree of sociopathy is to blame if you are able to read this novel and not leave it with a tearsoaked tissue or, at the very least, a respect for the complexity of these social issues. We have got to do better. TL;DR? Read this book.
Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales Quick  Dirty: I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes YA Paranormal books with Angels. It is captivating, refreshing and fun. Opening Sentence: In the beginning, theres a boy standing in the trees. The Review: Clara Gardner is part angel, so is her mother and her brother. All part angels have a purpose that they are destined to fulfill and Clara is trying to figure out what hers is. She has started to get visions of a beautiful boy standing in a forest fire. What do her visions mean? Is she supposed to save the boy from the fire or is her purpose something else? Her family decides to relocate to Jackson Hole Wyoming where she believes her purpose will take place. While attending her new school Clara learns that there is more to being an angelblood than she thought. She meets her mystery boy from her visions, his name is Christian Prescott and he is the most beautiful, intimidating boy she has ever met. Clara has always been slightly awkward especially when it comes to the opposite sex. As she tries to figure out her purpose she meets many new friends and happens to fall in love along the way, but will love interfere with her purpose? I really loved Clara she is a fun young girl trying to find her place in life. She doesnt always make the best decisions throughout the book, but I think she tries to follow her heart and do the right thing. She is a very strong heroine even though at times she does what she is told instead of what she thinks is right. It is so fun to get to see her make new friends and fall in love for the first time. It made it easier to connect with her because I feel what she goes through was similar to my high school experience. Christian is our mysterious boy from the visions. He is the total IT boy in school, dating the prettiest girl, rich, and a big time jock. I liked Christian, but at times I thought that he was a little clueless. I think he is a nice guy, but I felt that it was really awkward most of the time between him and Clara. I hope to see their relationship grow more in the books to come, because at this time I just see him as a friend and not a love interest. WARNING: MAJOR GUSHING AHEAD!!! Tucker Avery is a blue eyed, blonde haired hottie. Not only is he a sexy cowboy but to top it off he is sweet, respectful and probably the best boyfriend ever!!! Honestly, I think that he is amazing and one of the most wonderful boys to ever be invented by an author!!! I know that this isnt the case for everyone but he is the perfect boy for me :! Gushing has stopped Tucker is that boy that everyone loves and respects. He is popular because he is a good person not because he is gorgeous or way good at sports. I love his and Claras relationship; it grows very slow and is so sweet. He is that guy you wish you could meet, almost to perfect to be true. As you can tell I am a big fan of Tucker and I hope that we get to see him a lot more in future books. Angela is another angel blood that Clara meets in Jackson and they become friends. I like Angela because she is mysterious and unlike Christian or Tucker she is more of a loner, which Clara seems to really like and relate to. Angela has a fun attitude and is very fun to read about. She takes more risks in her life and she seems to have some secrets that I am excited to learn more about in future books. She is a great friend to Clara and really tries to help her understand more about angelbloods. This book is such a fun, fast read. It takes a little to get into because there is a lot of background information that you have to go through, but it is so worth it. I have read so many angel books lately, but this one has a new fresh idea that just captivated me. The characters are fun, the plot is interesting and the ending is perfect. You arent left with a horrible cliffhanger, but you are left wanting more. I also love that this book is set in Jackson Wyoming. I happen to live only a few hours from there so I can really relate to all the places they visit in the book. I know that this will not be the case for the majority of people but I think that its a plus. I highly recommend this book to any fans of a good YA paranormal read, it will not disappoint. Cynthia Hand has created a wonderful enticing world that you will be left wondering about long after you finish the book. Notable Scene: But then I see him. Hes standing with his back to me near my locker. A surge of electricity zings through me as I recognize his shoulder, his hair, the shape if his head. In a flash Im in the vision, seeing him both in the black fleece jacket among the trees and for real, just down the hall simultaneously, like the vision is a thin veil laid on top of reality. I take a step toward him, my mouth opening to call his name. Then I remember that I dont know it. Like always, its as if he hears me anyway and starts to turn, and my heart skips a beat when I dont wake up but see his face now, his mouth curling up in a half smile as he jokes with the guy next to him. He glances up and his eyes meet mine. The hallway melts away. Its only him and me now, in the forest. The vision comes from behind him, the fire on the hillside roaring toward us, faster that it could ever possibly happen. I have to save him. I think. Thats when I faint. FTC Advisory: HarperCollinsHarper Teen provided me with a copy of Unearthly. No goody bags, sponsorships, material connections, or bribes were exchanged for my review.
Warning: While some spoilers appear throughout this review, I dont think they give the story away. When I first heard HarperCollins was publishing a novel that had been deeply buried for decades by Harper Lee and her sister, I shared many of the same sentiments as the rest of the world: fear, disgust, nervousness. I did not want my image of Harper Lee to be ruined and I certainly did not want a major publishing company taking advantage of a vulnerable lady whom has decided to live her remaining years in private. As months passed and a publication date was declared, I decided to read the book regardless of whatever press it received. Love it or hate it, I would be better off just knowing. I preordered the book at my favorite independent store in the haunts of my sleepy vacation town instead of back home because I was dedicated to ripping off the bandaid as soon as I could. I cracked open Go Set a Watchman to the first page around 9:15 a.m. on July 14th the bookstore opened at 9 and spent the rest of the day reading. I was enthralled. Unlike my days reading and teaching To Kill a Mockingbird, the pages turned quickly. Scout, who can sometimes annoy me in TKAM because, lets face it, shes a sixyearold narrator, has grown into an independent 26yearold woman returning to Maycomb as Jean Louise. While she has outgrown Maycomb, she has not outgrown other features of her past. She may no longer fight against wearing shoes or washing her hands, but shes not beyond jumping into the river fully dressed. She may have adjusted to living in New York City, but the night chirps down by the river make her yearn for her quiet, sleepy town. She may still have no desire to dress like a lady, but she seriously considers marriage and her ideal husband. Jean Louise is pulled between two worlds just as as the rest of America was at the time mid 1950s. Shethey are pulled between what they have come to know and what society expects of them. To say Atticus is a racist in Go Set a Watchman is simply clickbait. He is not. He views segregation through the lens of the 10th amendment. I wouldnt even call him a segregationist, but since our vocabulary lacks the appropriate term for Atticuss nuance, I can see why writers would jump to such extreme terms. In Go Set a Watchman, Atticus is not the same idol he was TKAM and thats the point. Scout has idolized Atticus her entire life, and it is in GSAW that she must finally evolve as a thinker, a character, a person, and detach herself from her father and her hometown. Atticus is not what the story is all about. Scout, Jean Louise is the story. Jean Louises journey within herself is so wholly American that I want to lift her triumphantly. There are tones of Huck Finn in Jean Louises words as she struggles to understand her hometown and the father she thought she knew. Her experience as she grapples through the muck and grime is what makes this book shine. Harper Lee forces the reader to look beyond the idolized, commissioned TKAM and into a more realistic, complex world. Life is no longer crystal clear for Jean Louise, because Harper Lee understands that it has never been crystal clear for any of us. Lee forces Jean Louise to come into herself whether she likes it or not, because thats what happens to adults. We must confront the darkness in order to see the light. Thats what Atticus would want for his only daughter, right? To listen, to think, to participate. To find what she truly believes. For over 50 years the world has idolized To Kill a Mockingbird. We have taught it in our classrooms, we have bought commemorative editions, and we have yearned for more. It makes sense that when Harper Lee was taken to task by her publisher in the late 1950s to write more of Scouts childhood, she would produce To Kill a Mockingbird. Its the only story that makes sense, that could exist before Go Set a Watchman, the already written manuscript. Atticus has to be what Atticus is in both texts because Harper Lees finger is so accurately on the pulse of the 1950s in the south and on that of human nature. We idolize, we grow, and eventually, we think. Our impression of Atticus has to evolve as Jean Louise ages or else we shroud ourselves in the ignorance Harper Lee wants us to avoid. If we only hope to know Atticus as he is in TKAM, we have limited ourselves and our understanding of people. We must recognize the limitations in one another and in ourselves to grow and participate. We must open our eyes. We must see beyond ourselves and our idols, which is why Go Set a Watchman is just as important, if not more so, than To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lees unedited words are witty and insightful and coy. Shes funny. I read passages aloud to my husband because they were so enjoyable. I read passages aloud because they were so perfectly southern. As I read the book, I felt like Harper Lee got it. She was able to articulate honest perspectives and various sides to an incredibly complex, but important national discussion. Although this book was written nearly 60 years ago, lets believe that it wasnt published until now for a reason. Maybe our thirst for more from Harper Lee is better quenched now than it would have been in the 1960s. Maybe Go Set a Watchman can make us challenge the watchmen we establish in society and in our lives? Maybe we can evolve like Jean Louise? I cant help but think about why Harper Lee didnt want Go Set a Watchman published. Did she not want our perspective of Atticus to change? Did she not want additional publicity or national attention after TKAM? Whatever the reason, I am saddened to think that she may not approve of this publication. But, upon reading Go Set a Watchman, my appreciation for her writing and her characters is boundless. I will champion Harper Lee as a national treasure because she is. She is able to show us what is and what society expects of us.
Quite a few fans of the series have told me that they hadnt been interested in Butchs story and that it was a disappointing read. The weakest entry into the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. Either because there was too much side stories taking away from the main couple, or they didnt like Butch and Marissa. Um, hello! Butch was the only human male character in the series and I found him completely fascinating. For me Butchs official book was the one I had been dying of curiosity to read about. Not just because he was the only male human, but because hes been a favorite character of mine since book one. Butch and Marissas tango consumed me from the first book. Even Butchs disturbingendearinghilarious stalking warmed my heart. From the last book I was bleeding for Butch as he wants to be in the foray with his brothers. But he knows that he is still an outsider. It comes as no surprise that Butch would get a loop hole to become a vampire. In the end Butch has enough vamp blood in him to be turned, I was slightly disappointed by this my first go around. But I dont mind it so much now. Even if having a human as part of the group tickled my fancy. Maybe because the emotions and need for him to become part of the Brotherhood really hit me hard this time. Oh, and you wont believe who is blood line related to! Butch makes a great member of team blood suckers. Really. Besides things arent all hunky dory. At the beginning Butch goes through some scary shit. Hes forever changed, but it also opens the door way for a new stage in the war between The Virgin Scribe and the Omega. Im getting a strong feeling that with this series a lot of the relationship issues are mainly due to the characters not communicating. A couple of times I got frustrated with Butch and Marissa when the thing that would have solved their issue was a quick sit and talk. What do I know, tension makes the drama! AND miscommunications is the key ingredient to any dramaticangst filled romance. Marissa is an interesting character. I feel like I should be annoyed with her. However, she embodies the issues that the glymeraAKA vampire societyhas. This is old school sexist shit. The kind of stuff that makes my blood boil. Which makes Marissa such an amazing character. As she is forced away from the life that has repressed her. Its painful to realize how less she thinks of herself because of what society thinks she should be. I was moved as Marissa decides to do what she wants to do, and to make herself happy. Sure there were moments that I just wanted to bang my head against a wall. But then I realized this was the first steps of a rebirth for glymera and its sexist ways. Lover Revealed touches on how bonded males arent perfect, that domestic abuse is very much real in in vampire society. Its refreshing to see reality touch home here. Making these books legitimate and not so much some silly dark fantasy. Especially as it emphasized how easily women in the glymera are property with no true rights. I cant wait to read the later books to see womens rights transpire in the glymera. Especially concerning the Scribe Virgin. As always Ward is fantastic at including side stories. John Mathews side story was really engaging. The reader gets to follow him as his rage finally gets turned into grief at the lost of Tohrment leaving. Hes getting closer to the transition and the brothers are trying to help guide him. Zsadist makes fantastic little appearances as he tries to help John out. Its kind of sad as John struggles to accept his muteness, and he sees it as a weakness. But I adore that he finally gets some friends. As the trioJohn, Qhuinn, Blaylockare not only one of my favorite storylines but characters. Rhev and his head of security make a very interesting story here and Im ready for the dirt on sympaths already! Mr. X has been reinstated as the head Forelesser and hes out to find a permanent way to end his undead life, he does not want to go back to the Omega. Mr. X was the very first lesser we were introduced to in Dark Lover. I really enjoyed his story as he tried to find the keys to a prophecy that would give one man the power to devour lesser and really kill them. The fact that an evil guy like Mr. X was trying so desperately to escape the ultimate evil. The irony was not lost on me. Though I truly felt sympathy for the poor guy. Last time I found the story between Vishous and Butch really interesting. Well this time I was moved. Oh, my gosh. Bravo Ward. Bravo. Vishous comes to the conclusion that his feelings for Butch are deep. Not just Best FriendIdDieFor deep. But Idsellmysoultoprotectyou deep. Love that knows no gender. What I love is that once Butch realizes it the truth doesnt faze him. On some level hes known all along. Not to mention after a certain scene in the last book. Its explored that if Marissa wasnt in the picture there could be something between the two. My heart broke. But I truly love Butch and Marissa together. Ward does a wonderful job showing this love triangle some compassion, and Im thankful. I truly enjoyed it. It was handled with aplomb. Ill be the first to admit that I had a lot of frustration with Marissa and Butchs love story. Though I realize because of who they are it makes perfect sense. The inability to talk things out and just jumping to conclusions always annoys me. Not to mention that Butch again has thoughts about how angry hed be if Marissa was no longer a virgin. How he couldnt handle someone else feeding her even though he knows he can trust her. Otherwise this was a great story for Butch and I loved his backstory. Especially the family past. The whole side story of Mr. X was really fun as well as he tries to make the prophecy come true, and getting more details on the Omega was really interesting. As usual all the side stories are fantastic! Its one of my favorite things to see in PNR and I love that it continues throughout the series. This one was a little lighter then the otherswell coming off of Zsadists story it isbut its still dark and edgy! Man am I looking forward to heralding changes in the future books. Sexual Content: Humor, bedroom scenes, minor homosexual themes, and some other darker themes about rape. Also deals with domestic violence. A very realistic take on sex and losing ones virginity. 55 Fabulous, a beautiful obsession! Originally reviewed at Book Whispers. Initial review from 2010.
Kat tipped her head back, meeting my stare. Her throat worked on her next words. I think I might love you. Air punched out of my lungs, I held her tight and I knew right then I would burn down the whole universe for her if I had to. I would do anything to keep her safe. Kill. Heal. Die. Anything. Because she was my everything. And I wanted to tell her so, but I didnt want to tempt the universe, bad things happened to the people I loved. Daemon Black Do This the Right Way, Onyx Holy chocolate chip cream cookies! This book is simply awesome! I am so totally the self professed number one fan of Jennifer Armentrout right now. I am so in love with this series, that I am willing to sacrifice my Ohsoprecious Pokemon collectibles just to get my hands on the next books. Its sad, I never I thought I will see the light of day when I will trade my beloved Pikachu for something. But this shit just got serious! I am totally hooked and I need to have Opal and Shadows SOON! Like, right now. The Book.. oh, ONYX is just so hooot! The chemistry between Katy and Daemon is oozing and sizzling throughout the whole novel and I was close to combusting. If you think Obsidian is good then consider it just a foreplay because Onyx is definitely the main act! Ok, I freaking sounds like a pervert there, but I cant think of a more fitting description than that. Pretty dirty of me. winks The books started just after the events of the first book. After Daemon healed Katy in Obsidian, the two developed a strong bizarro connection. Sort of like an Icanfeelyouevenifyouarefiftyfeetawayfromme connection. Accidentally, Daemon also mutated Katy, giving her some of his alien powers. That made her more of a threat to the Luxens as she do not have control over her newfound abilities. Another thing that complicates the matter is the presence of the DOD, who comes to town to investigate the events of the night when Katy, Daemon and Dee fought the Arums. Apparently, the force of that fight destroyed a satellite. If a fried satellite is still not enough to convince you that this book is awesome, then there is definitely something wrong with you. Now Katy is not just in danger of exposing the Luxens to Arums and DOD, she is also in danger of exposing herself. Enter the new boy in town; Blake. Like Katy, he was also mutated by a luxen and he offered Katy his help to train her on how to control her new powers. Katy, wanting to protect herself and Daemon, agrees. so Blake trains Katy, hitting on her on the sidelines, too, because really, it is a requirement in YA books that at least two guys should have a crush on our Heroine. Not that Im complaining. However; unlike me, Daemon is not that thrilled about the arrangements. If you are one of those people who despised Love Triangles then I must warn you that there is a bit of that here, well, maybe more that a bit. But I advise you to just stick with it because the love triangle is actually tolerable. Come to think of it, its not even a Love triangle because honestly, who can compete with Daemon Black? Maybe Jace Wayland, but hes out there drooling over Clary, so yeah, Daemon has no competition. Daemon had me rolling on the floor with laughter many times because of those names he purposely mistakenly substitute for Blake. That is just sooo funny, freaking hilarious Daemon. you really need to read it to know what I mean. After reading Obsidian, I felt like there was a hallow inside my chest that only Daemon can fill Isnt that just so dramatic? MEH. I was so desperate for a Daemon Fix during those dark times. And then I read Onyx and I am beyond ecstatic. In Onyx, I get to see a lot more of Daemon, and dude, he is hotness personified here! I get to see a different side of him, a softer, sweeter and more loving and caring side of our most favourite YA Alien hottie. Of course, hes still grumpy, stabworthy and arrogant at times, but he wouldnt be Daemon if hes not a little bit of a Douche, right? And then Katy, she still has her smart mouth and her ever famous middle finger here. I love Katy as much as I love Daemon. I still think shes one of the most lovable kickbutt heroine there is. And man, did she kick ass in this book! I guess having alien powers made her more bad ass. Like charmander evolving to charlizard. Okay, not a very good comparison there, but you get what I mean. The romance in this book is beautifully written with just the right amount of steamy, swoon worthy and toe curling scenes. I applaud Jennifer Armentrout for that because she does know how to make her readers swoon and drool. Katy struggled a lot with her feelings for Daemon here. Shes caught between her growing love for Daemon and doubt regarding his feelings for her. She firmly believes at first that the only reason why Daemon wants her is because of their alien connection. And I love that about her, because she shows that Daemon needs to earn her trust first before she gives him her heart. And Daemon definitely proves that hes worthy of Kat. It is really sweet and heart melting, seeing Daemon opening up. Katy and Daemons relationship is also lovely. They are so perfect with each other because their personalities fit. They treat each other as equals and although Daemon is fiercely protective of Katy, not once did his actions border on abuse. And even so, Katy will never allow that to happen as shes no doormat. My kind of girl. Onyx is not all hearts and butterflies though. As a matter of fact it is has a darker and heavier plot. The revelations are heart breaking and the twists.. shocking. And even though Kat and Daemon sort of fix their issues in the end, there is no happy ending for the Luxens, in general, here. And that ending is just BRUTAL! Have I ever mentioned that I hate cliffhangers? Over all, I really really really love this book and I cant wait to read Opal and Bethany and Dawsons love story in Shadows. Buy or borrow? DEFINITELY BUY! P.S. I just need to get this out of my chest before I end this review... I hate the cover! It looks like an R18 Movie Poster. whats with the girls expression? She looks like shes having a bookgasm. My mom thought I was reading something nasty! Er. And I just hate guys on white sandos. Though the guy in the cover is hot, I much prefer his wearing something more PG13. for my moms sake, of course.
After being on hold for this book since the October of last year, it was very satisfying to hold the book that has been touted as the top read of 2009. I had once read the first page of this book, and loved it. This time, I can say the same for the entire book. My opinion The Help starts from the perspective of Aibileen, a black maid, who works in the house of Elizabeth Leefolt, one of Skeeters close friends. Elizabeth is to be the host of the bridge club, in which Skeeter, Hilly, another of Skeeters close friends, and Mrs Walters, Hillys mother, are to play. Before soon, Hilly is insisting on separate bathrooms for the women of the household and the help, for hygiene purposes. Minny, Hillys maid, sasses when ever she gets irritated or angry. She strives to hold her temper in, but it never works. Soon, she has lost yet another job. To compound matters, Hilly has been badmouthing Minny, thereby making it hard for Minny to find another job to feed her huge family. Skeeter has just returned home after graduation, without a job or any plan about what to do with her life. Her mother wants her to get married, but Skeeter isnt interested. She wants to write, and after much deliberation, she comes up with a very brave and controversial idea to write about. There starts a very powerful story of three women, or rather five women in my opinion, since in addition to the three main protagonists, Hilly and Miss Celia, Minnys new employer are very crucial to the story as well. Did you ever feel when reading a book, that you had to whoop in delight or whip any character to nice manners, or cry with strong heartfelt emotions, for the sufferings of some characters? The Help WOWed me on all factors. It touched me at a deep core, leaving me to think of the book for days afterwards. Not many good books bring every character to life, major or minor. Doing that makes a book great in my opinion. Feeling the presence of the characters around you makes their experiences all the more believable and credible. Minny, as the sassmouth, was the one I identified with the most. I loved it that she took no crap from others. On the one hand, she was scared of the consequences, but on the other, she couldnt just sit and watch. Miss Celia, on the other hand, enjoyed being pampered, but mostly, she enjoyed having someone who spoke to her or chided her with genuine intentions rather than with a smug perspective. Aibileen was the more mature and respected maid, whose opinions, fears and wishes have been shaped by years of experience as a housemaid  bringing up seventeen white children, watching them call her Mama more often than they would call their biological mothers, seeing the looks of distrust and suspicion, even disgust on the faces of the women she waited on. Hillys suggestion of separate bathrooms breaks some wall within her and its quite sorrowful reading how little power these women the help have in their hands. Skeeter was a perplexing character to me. It is evident from the start that she is repulsed by the racial segregation and bigotry that corrupts her friends thoughts. She yearns to do something about it, and while in the process of determining how to begin her career, she comes up with an idea to help the black women waiting in the white households. While I found her intentions honorable, occasionally I was wondering what the whole exercise was for Skeeter. How genuinely did she feel the pain and sufferings of the black maids? How much did she empathize with them? Was the whole project primarily a literary exercise for her or a humanitarian undertaking? I was never convinced of Skeeters position throughout the story. Although I had no doubt that she believed in the welfare of the help, it was not clear to me if her participation was passive or aggressive. The Help gives a lucid description of the difficulties faced by the black families. There is Hillys Home Help Sanitation project that advocates separate bathrooms for the residents of a white household and the help, reasoning that the black people carry different diseases and can endanger the lives of the people they wait on. Then there is the case of the black boy who is horribly assaulted, and blinded as a result, simply because he used a bathroom reserved for whites, when there was no board or notice beside the bathroom. In addition there are several subtle references such as when Elizabeths daughter, Mae, plays with Aibileens comb, and her mother insists on Mae taking her bath immediately. It has to be told that amidst this murkiness, there are a lot of positive stories too of white women helping the black maids. Such as, one woman leaving a note before her death to her maid, thanking her for taking care of her baby. The mother of the blinded boy was given paid leave to take some leave and stay by her son. The Help is not just a recounting of hardships, it is also an expression of the good happening in times of bad. It shows how even before Martin Luther Kings famous speech, white women were embracing their black maids, if not literally, at least as women who deserve equality and respect. In addition to being a story of the relationship between the black and white women, it is also a story of motherdaughter relationships. There are several overtones of this theme throughout the book, both in the minimal recognition by babies and toddlers of their biological mothers as their true mothers, and in the relationship between Skeeter and her mother. Skeeters initial reactions to her ailing mother broke me badly. Her increasingly weakening mother is not a perfect epitome of a woman in many respects. She holds bigot opinions against the help, and is not one to gracefully take to situations where she might be humiliated. In short, a woman who protectively guards her status in society. But she is not an evil woman. Her beliefs are something that she has been adhering to, from years of seeing and hearing the same things  an old womans hesitancy to let go of her past, however unjustifiable. I waited for a long time for Skeeter to wake up to her mothers health deterioration. When she does, it is with a sorrow hard to bear. Overall, this is a great book, in my opinion. The characters, the place, the events, all feel very real. And as I read the book, I couldnt help but vociferously celebrate the small successes of the human spirit, and cry in disgust at all the prejudices flying around. Title Demystified Before I started reading this book, I couldnt make head nor tail of what this title means. It seemed to me a weird pair of words, as if indicating a particular instance of someone helps on some matter, which probably sets the dice rolling. But after reading it, I berated myself for not guessing that The Help referred to the maids who served in the white households. So simple, yet so eloquent! Cover Art Demystified The book comes with a very peacefullooking cover, that try as I might, I cant decipher it. I do have several theories, but since I am not so sure of any of them, I will refrain from guessing. I would however love to hear your analysis on the cover, so please leave me a comment!
...But knowing that theres a whole lot we dont understand has made me reluctant to indulge in foreordination, destiny, or things that people say are meant to be. Saying something is meant to be is a cop out. Its a way for people to deal when they screw up or when life hands them a bowl of shit stew. The things that are meant to be are the things we cant control, the things we dont cause, the things that happen regardless of who or what we are. Like sunsets and snowfall and natural disasters. Ive never believed hardship or suffering was meant to be. Ive never believed relationships were meant to be. We choose. In large part, we choose. We create, we make mistakes, we burn bridges, we build new ones. Wow. I mean, just wow. This book was...wow. I think The Song of David rendered me speechless, and all I can say now is WOW! I dont know how Amy Harmon manages to do it, but she did it again without a hint of failure and doubt! I didnt know it was possible that I can fall for her writing more than I already did, but lo and behold. Everything she writes is just so brilliantly and magically woven, that I cant help but give a half of my heart on the line whenever I read her works. Of course, this book was definitely not an exemption. Just by reading the blurb, I was already undoubtedly ready to rate it 5 stars. And OMG just seeing that this is a spinoff of The Law of Moses, I was already reeling in sheer happiness. It seemed like the perfect gift from the literary heavens above. Sex is not the most intimate thing two lovers can do. Even when the sex is beautiful. Even when its perfect...The most intimate thing we can do is to allow the people we love most to see us at our worst. At our lowest. At our weakest. True intimacy happens when nothing is perfect. I love all her works, but this, by far, has got to be my favorite. The rawness of every single element of this book just brought me to tears. The story was unique, refreshing, and was even a tad bit lifealteringYep, it was that good. The story was told in such a clever manner, that you just could not put the book down. Seriously, take it from me. It definitely reels you in, and eventually, you just get attached to the story, and even the characters themselves. WE ALL DIE. Eventually, that is how the story ends for all of us. There is no variance. There is no exception. We all die. Young, old, strong, weak. We all go sooner or later. Ive come to accept that, maybe even better than most, though I dont think Ill ever embrace it. Knowing that Moses would get to be a part of this book, I was in utter bliss, but finding out that this book will be told in two POVs and one of them would be Moses, I was past the level of ecstatic. Tag and Moses told the story hypnotically, and in the end, it definitely did the book justice. If theres one thing Amy Harmon aces in, its the establishment of her characters. Oh ode to the literary gods, thank you so much for Amy Harmons brilliance! To say that I love the characters of this book is putting it mildly. I dont think I can ever express how much I love them all. Millie, Tag, Henry, Moses, Georgia, and every single one in this book gave their own magic to the story. GAH! It was like they were brought to life. I just seriously felt attached to them all! And because of that...GROUP HUG! But I watched Millie. I watched Millie because she fascinated me. She was a brand new species, an intoxicating mix of girl and enigma, familiar yet completely foreign. Id never met anyone like her, yet I felt like Id known her forever. And since the moment Id looked down into her face and felt that jolt of odetojoyandholyshit, Id been falling, falling, falling, unable to stop myself, unable to look away, helpless to do the smart thing. I am in sheer admiration for Millie. She has got to be one of my favorite book heroines. She isnt your usual damsel in distressshe was definitely far from that. Sure she had her own sense of vulnerability, but damn if she didnt know how to handle herself well. Shes spitfire and blaze, and I just love her to bits. But holy mother of all book boyfriends, dont even get me started on Tag! I. AM. ABSOLUTELY. HEADS. OVER. HEELS. IN. LOVE. WITH. HIM. No. Theres more to him than that. Hes special, and he makes me feel special. Sometimes I think theres something between us. I can feel it in my chest, the way I cant ever really catch my breath when hes around. I feel it in my stomach too, the way it flips when he says my name. And mostly, I feel it when he talks to Henry. Hes gentle. And hes sweet. I want to babble about Tag and Millie, but theres just one word to describe their love for each other: UNCONDITIONAL Its more than that. You cant see a song. You feel a song, you hear a song, you move to it. Just like I cant see you, but I feel you, and I move toward you. When youre with me, I feel like I glimpse a David nobody else knows is there. Its the Song of David, and nobody else can hear it but me. I dont know what else to say. This book was just perfect. I was in a huge feelsplosion because of this. This. is. the. perfect. reading. experience! 5 stars! Thats what makes it beautiful. Its devastating. I love it when a song devastates me. ... Ah, the sweet kind of suffering. ... The best kind. ... Ive been suffering for a while now, Millie. ... You have? ... Since the moment I saw you. It devastated me. And I love when a girl devastates me. ... Ive never devastated anyone before. ... Im guessing youve left a wake of destruction..You just dont know.
I received this ARC by winning a giveaway from Sabaa Tahir. This in no way influences my voice or opinions in the following review.  Gosh... Where do I even start with this one? This book was incredible. I dont even know exactly how to get out the words Im looking for to describe my feelings about this novel, so bear with me... This story takes place in two different points of view. You have Laia; the orphan girl, the slave, the guiltridden sister, the naive young woman who is starting to see the world for exactly what it is, brutal and unfair. Then, you have Elias: the unwanted boy, the soldier, the trained killer, the brutalized young man who sees the way the world could be, if only he could find it in himself to make it happen. These two are the burning embers in the ashes, preparing to light the world on fire, if only they can follow the right paths to lead them to their destinies. Elias is easy to love. A forlorn boy trapped in a world he wants nothing to do with. Seeing a future for himself better than the one he is destined to follow. Hoping for something, anything, that can free him from the imprisonment he was forced into as a child. Hes a young man who wants nothing more than to make a future for himself that doesnt involve killing everyone around him. He sees the world differently than the soldiers that surround him and knows that he doesnt fit in. Because of this, I fell in love with him instantly. Hes lost in this sea of armor and brutality and my heart just broke for him. He only wants what any normal person would want: happiness and freedom. As a reader, I followed him on his journey to try and find it, and I will tell you, my lovely readers, that his journey may surprise you. Laia, on the other hand, has not been so easily taken to by some readers and bloggers. Ive heard a few claims that she just wallows and whines through most of the book, and to that I say that I can see your point. Heres the truth though, you, as a reader, cannot go into reading a new book EXPECTING the main female character to be the next Celaena Sardothien, Hermione Granger, Meghan Chase, etc. In many ways, Laia reminds me of Sorcha from Daughter of the Forest by Juliette Marillier. Both suffer greatly and sacrifice for their loved ones, but they suffer silently and beautifully. Theres something to be said about a character who, rather than murdering and fighting through a problem, finds their strength within and chooses a less violent route. Laia faces the demons not only in the world around her, but in herself, to find out who she is and how she can make a difference for the ones that she loves in a world that is bent on tearing everyone apart. She is forced to dig deep to find the strength to stay true to herself and stand up, against all odds, for what she believes in. This is her bravery, her fighting spirit, and her strength. I can tell you that you will not find Laia brandishing a sword and cutting through some guts although you may in the sequel, not gonna lie, but you will find her fighting viciously for her life and the lives of those around her. She is strong, believe it or not, because she is human and nothing more. I have to tell all of you who have read this novel to ask yourselves this: would you have suffered as beautifully as Laia and still stayed on the right path if your lives were switched? I daresay that you would not  I would not  but Laia would, and she does... As far as the romance is concerned in this book, you DO have love triangles, I will warn you! I actually really didnt mind them though. You have a love triangle for Elias and a love triangle for Laia, but each person that Elias and Laia have to choose between someone else or each other, represent a different part of their life and a separate path towards an unknown destiny. Please excuse me as I try to explain what I mean without giving away any part of the story! I can see that if Laia does not choose Elias, she would end up in a very different sort of circumstance than if she does, and would probably develop as a character in the opposite direction. If Elias does not choose Laia, skies, his entire life could be in even more of an uproar and he would turn into a different person. Its a delicate balance between what is right and wrong, and which choice is the right one for them, as individuals. I loved all of the characters, including every single one in the love triangles. The depth and reasoning behind each character was true and well thought out. The beauty of this story and the love triangles it holds is that the main focus doesnt solely lie on the love interest, but rather the corruption and brutality, and each characters main goal. The love triangles, in my point of view, were formed, but the main focus stayed off them, which was really nice to read. I never knew which way Laia and Elias were going to sway and I am still not completely sure about the paths they chose for themselves in the end. I can guess at what will happen, but Im sure that Sabaa will continue to prove me wrong! In truth, I cant say anything more without giving the story away, but overall, I was completely in love with this book. I was considering giving my ARC away, but I found myself just clutching it to my chest and literally curling myself around it as if to protect it from my own thoughts. I preordered it that night. I told my friends that this may be the book that I have to have every single copy of, seeing as Im already keeping the ARC and the new hardcover Ive bought. I just... I cant... I dont even know how... JUST PREORDER IT ALREADY!!! Because Im holding on to my copy and every copy I can get my hands on unless you want to see a desperate blogger sobbing in the fetal position... Im not ready for that and Im pretty sure you arent either!! So, here, Ill make it easy for you. Its 6.00 off the hardcover right now if you preorder it. It comes out exactly ONE WEEK from today, on Tuesday, April 28th. I promise you that you wont regret it. If you do, than you can tie me up and throw me to the ghouls. PSSTT!!! The Amazon one is actually a few cents cheaper! Also, Ms. Sabaa Tahir, any publisher would be INSANE not to pick up your sequel because this book was pure brilliance. It was so beautifully written and just turned into this amazing masterpiece. I LOVE it and I know many other people do as well. I cant wait to read book two and Ill be jumping and crying for joy the day you announce that your sequel has been picked up by a publisher who knows your worth. You are a phenomenal author and I look forward to any other books I will be seeing from you. Keep at it. Youre wonderful. 3 Kelly
Moore to Lose by Julie A Richman 4.5 stars!!! The one thing that she would give up everything for was not a fantasy and she knew that. She had tasted it. She had savoured it. She had consumed it. She had been consumed by it. And now, even if she had a treasure map leading her to it, she would still be at a loss as to how to find it. Or what she would do with it, if she did find it. Moore to Lose is the sequel to Searching For Moore. I loved this book but I was also extremely frustrated at times, not because the story was poor or it didnt go the way I wanted, but there was a distinct lack of Schooner in this book and I wanted more Schooner Moore. This book explores Mias back story, what happened in those years that she was apart from Schooner. She has certainly led an entertaining life thats for sure. Her strong character is prevalent throughout the book but we also see her moments of weakness and some of these are far from pretty. There was one part of this book that absolutely killed me and I didnt see it coming a mile off, but it hits you like a freight train and I cried my eyes out, big fat ugly tears!! Mia had a few serious relationships in her life after Schooner. I will start with Tom, he was 10 years her senior and a teacher. He was an Irish charmer that had all the girls in his classes vying for his attention. He was a poet, had written screen plays and was seriously good looking but he knew it. Tom and Mia eventually get together but I must admit I did have a big problem with his nick name for her jailbait it just sounds all kinds of wrong. Whilst the beginning of their relationship made me cringe you do get a feel for their dynamic after a while, however, I never warmed to him at all, there was something there I didnt like and in the end my gut feeling was justified. Did you ever really love me, Schooner? Why the elaborate ruse? Flying high, a flirtation with the sun. She was Icarus. He was the sun. And that brief flirtation melted her wings. Who was she kidding? Her wings were the least of the damage. He had her heart. And she didnt know of shed ever get it back. Michael, Michael, Michael, I loved Michael, he was perfect, totally and utterly perfect. It is rare that I love two male leads in a book but I did love him, he was kind, considerate, gorgeous, just the epitome of a perfect gentleman. Although we got Mias insecurities a bit during their relationship I couldnt see how this relationship would end. Of course we know it does as she is single when she meets up with Schooner again later on. ...you got that, Buster!...Yeah, I got it. I love you Mia, I love you so much... Good, because youve got me as long as you will have me... Sounds great, lets get married... This book also covers everything else in between, times in Mias life that she genuinely wants to forget. There are one night stands and drug usage, times that she is totally embarrassed about but she manages to pull herself out with the aide of some amazing friends. Her friendship circle is amazing and they really were there for her throughout, she made a new family. However, Schooner was always there, gnawing away. Finally we get Schooner, Schooners POV when he eventually finds and meets with Mia and also what happens after, especially with CJ and his children. I did find this bit interesting and it did add to the story. I still hate CJ with a passion, which is actually hard to do, I very rarely hate a character despite how bad a person they are, but I actually couldnt stand her. And now Karma. Today the universe finally rights itself. Karma is truly going to be a bitch. Then eventually we get Mia and Schooners story going forward. Towards the end of this book me and Schooner needed to have words. Some of his actions were totally and utterly WTF moments. We all know the course of true love never runs smooth and Schooners family make sure they try and interfere at every available opportunity. However, I was seriously pissed at the end. I need Book 3 now!! I need to know what happens...my brain was mush by the time this book finished and I could have personally killed Julie A Richman. I should stop reading these trilogies until they are all out, but I am a sucker for them. At least they keep you on your toes and you have another instalment to look forward to. Another thing I love about this series is that the couple are in their 40s. It is refreshing to read a story about my own age group. Even though this series spans their life from their teens to their 40s you feel as if you have live their life with them and it gives you a greater understanding of the characters and to a certain degree why they act the way they do, Also, you are getting both sides of the story so you have the full picture. This book is beautifully written, a real page turner and once again I couldnt put it down. Seriously cannot wait for the next one. I need more Schooner and Mia in my life!! Fab series!! Well, its true. I cant think of anything but you. He was smiling eartoear. Its smoochal, Baby Girl. Its smoochal. www.theromancecover.com
Realitys what other people dream for you. Damn these books. Three nights worth of sleep because of them and Im just finishing The Dream Thieves. I need to catch up, but firstly  this book was magical and wonderful and set my heart on fire, gave it wings, plunged it into darkness and cemented the status of the series as a new favorite of mine. Go figure. Left with a shock back in The Raven Boys, we, or rather they, are still on a quest to find the longlost Welsh King, Glendower. But the plot thickens when Ronans secrets come to the surface and threaten to explode into dreams  quite literally. Turns out, Ronan is maybe the most special of the Raven boys. With the ability to make a reality out of his dreams, his destiny as a Greywaren is both fascinating and creepy, but thats the norm in Henrietta so lets move on. His selfdestructive, raw and intense mind has also the potential of bringing the world to its knees by draining it of life. It felt nice to see through his eyes, despite his head being a cruel and dark place to be. He has lots of issues, but sparks of the boy under the hard facade make him as lovable as the rest: his adoration of his father, his soft attention to Adam, his unwavering loyalty and admiration for Gansey and his almost paternal dynamic with his younger brother all paint him in a different light. His first secret was himself. He was brother to a liar and brother to an angel, son of a dream and son of a dreamer. My love for the spectacular girl named Blue Sargent knows no bounds. Blue is so imaginatively nuanced and incredibly cool. Shes the awesomest of the women at 300 Fox Way, despite her nonpsychic life, which says a lot considering the specimens waiting for her at home. Punkish, weirdish, but a great person. In that moment, Blue was a little in love with all of them. Their magic. Their quest. Their awfulness and strangeness. Her raven boys. The character of Gansey will be the death of me. HES SO PERFECT. His geekiness. His posh persona. His obliviousness. His kindness. His otherworldly drive. His insatiable curiosity. His sarcasm. His view of the world. Theyre all just simple counterparts of the same bewildering piece of fiction; hes a piece of art in his individuality. He shines as no other and remains as the foundation of the story from every angle. While Im gone, Gansey said, pausing, dream me the world. Something new for every night. My love for Adam diminished by a few shades. His admirable integrity was at the core of his beliefs, but after a while his pride and urgent need of independence became awfully tiring. Sure, hes messed up since the end of the first book, but throwing hissy fits does not bode well in any scenery. Hes broken, alright. A ticking bomb. He does reach a relative balance by the final of the novel but it did not make up for those gutwrenching fights with Gansey. Man, those broke me, because Gansey tried so much to help his friend, but it was simply not enough. Its like youre so keen on being Adam Parrish, army of one. Sadly enough, I realized a tidbit that did not struck me reading the first book: Noah feels like a secondary character. I love the glimpses into his personality and his strange sense of humor and his shyness, but he remains a sidekick, even if he is in the inner circle. Since we do not have his POV, Ganseys gravitational pull that manifests upon Ronan and Adam throughout their respective chapters does not appear in his case, implicitly creating a disruption between him and the squad since Gansey is the axis of their world. Perhaps its because of the fact that he is indeed faded, unlike the full force and lively flame of the others. Perhaps not. Another distinct element I felt was that, this time, the group or individual characters were not the focus; this time, the relationships, oneonone were developed so much more and I loved every piece of the process. For instance, Ronan and Adam, a pair that felt overlooked in the sequel, now felt like a powerful friendship. Adam and Gansey hit a few bumps along the road, but they were still an intricate part of the story. Ronan and Gansey suddenly proved the brotherhood and bromance that we were only teased with, sharing their history. Blue and Noah was a marvelous thing and so was the Ronan and Noah exhilarating dynamic, although few and far between since Noah was, as I said, inconsistent in his presence. Even Ronan and Blue with their babystepped improvement. Ronan, Noah said, I have a super bad feeling. Its called being dead, Ronan replied. Thats the sort of joke thats only funny if youre alive. Good thing I am. For now. And, of course, Blue and Gansey. Be still, my heart. The subtle romance unraveling between these two had me giddy with excitement and positively dreading the possible outcome of Gansey dying. That particular scene where it feels like theyre the only ones in the world turned me into a fangirl. Theyre just so perfect. So cute. Every Jane had me smiling, every hidden glance of Blues had me giggling and every single parallel universe Gansey conjured in his head dropped a bucket of sadness into the story. Theres gotta be a loophole. I want Blue and Gansey to create their little Henrietta heaven and live happily ever after searching kings and souls. Thered better be a loophole. My soul needs a loophole. THERE HAS TO BE A LOOPHOLE. Right? Right?! I wish you could be kissed, Jane, he said. Because I would beg just one off you. Under all this. He flailed an arm toward the stars. A surprising and curious addition to the cast was materialized in the face of The Gray Man. I dont even know what to call him  an antihero? A villain? A hero? Something in between all these, anyways. And he fit perfectly into this peculiar and odd gathering of strong, distinguished and well developed characters, primary and secondary alike. I am a definite fan of his. And, last but not least, I need to mention the Sargent women and their immediate nonrelated family. The trio was back at it again and it was a delight watching them playing the innocent devils. Honestly, Calla and Maura and Persephone made me laugh numerous times and I just love their familiarity, strangeness and questionable wisdom. I need to admit that my attention often wavered because were still talking about Glendower and energy and souls and all that jazz which, no matter how unique and interesting in principle, it does lose its appeal after a while. Fortunately, the focus on Ronan brought to table this imaginative seriously, wow idea of dream thievery and there were plenty of plot developments on that part, even though at times complicated to comprehend. The Dream Thieves was a great followup with a lovely blend of everything I love: adventure, romance, emotion overload, humor and thrills. I cannot wait to see what Henrietta and this little band of misfits have in store for me next. If you never saw the stars, candles were enough. ENJOY! 3
Her stare burned me from the inside. I wanted to worship her. I needed to. Every inch. I can finally and officially say that Katy and Daemon are one of my favorite couples! Even when Daemon was a douche and jerk to her in the beginning, he was actually like that for a reason and there were always reasons behind it. Even when he felt something for her and liked her in some way just didnt want to admit it or express it, it was sticking with him the whole time, he just had trouble showing it. Jennifer did a wonderful and amazing job with Daemons character and changed him in the best possible way I never really imagined. Oh Daemon Black, what are you doing to me? Nobody in this book is really the same. Theres death, violence, and lots of Daemon and Katy moments. Really, the moments I have been waiting for. Spoilers from Opal below. Just a warning. Unless you dont care or enjoy spoiling yourself : Origin starts off right where Opal left off. Katy is taken from Daemon to be tested and see who she is and how really is, while Daemon is tying to escape the community service and save Katy. Even though a lot of similar things from book 1 are happening, there are still a lot of differences. Even when I thought I would hate Katy a little and would end up always hating Daemon, I really didnt expect any of this. Her beauty struck me hard, like a bolt of lightning right in the chest. I froze there, how how long I dont know, unable to take my eyes off her, and then I took two long strides that brought me to the edge of the bed. Daemon has changed so much since Onyx. I really didnt see it and didnt pay much attention to it, but there were those small moments where his development grew in Katy and I was able to sense a small connection between them. I completely fell in love with him in Opal, and now, hes the sweet and caring guy who will do anything to save the girl he loves, even if it involves burning the whole city down or exposing himself. But when it came to the moments of them being together and enjoying the small time they were able to have, I couldnt stop reading or skim through some parts of their moments. Its not like if its something I completely enjoy reading, it was just something refreshing since I never knew it would actually happen. And let me say, boy do they have some moments. Katy has grown into a teenage who always expected to live her life exploring blogs and building hers while reading and thinking her life would go back to how it was. Well, she never expected this! Shes become a lot stronger and is someone nobody really knows what shes capable of. Shes someone different by a long shot and is still figuring out what she can do and how. Shes turned pretty badass since she risks herself trying to help and doing what she can and feels bad when she cant do anything because she isnt like the rest, but when it comes to being able to expose herself a little and letting go of some of her strength, I was happy to know this little kitten found out how to let her claws out. Blake isnt someone to mention a lot and talk about a lot. He deserved what he got and I was happy and glad it happened. I never liked him since the beginning and didnt trust him. I was on Daemons side even though at times I was confused finding out who he is and if he was different as well. He betrayed everyone and lied to everyone making them believe Chris was a real person when none of it was real. He was an asshole and was finally able to help Katy show her real strength and true power. Oh oh. Dee was finally back to the Dee I have always loved and missed. She was able to forgive Katy and missed her this whole time just was afraid to say it. Even with all the other things happening and leaving her a little broken and upset, she was strong and confident with whatever was happening. I was glad her character grew back and she was able to smile and laugh again, even more. Shes changed a lot and become a different person from who she was before. Shes still the same Dee with the cute but fierce attitude. New characters were introduced and my favorite was actually Archer, out of all. Luc is the same hilarious kid who makes everyone laugh including me because of how he talks and expresses things. Luckily he wasnt the one I expected to betray anyone even though so many betrayals happened. He stayed loyal and was the one who didnt mess with anyone and didnt let anyone mess with him. Archer sounded rude but when he was met by everyone else he was known as someone who actually cared and wanted to leave the place he was in as well. He wanted to live in a different place and be who he is without being caught or being treated differently. Hes different than the rest even though hes a little similar, just win more special abilities. I hope he returns to the final installment and it does look like he will along with Luc, but maybe theres something else awaiting for him. Then again, who was I kidding? When I set my mind to something, I did it. And mind was set. No pussyfooting around it. No point in waiting. It was right. It felt right. And thats what matteredthe only thing that mattered. I was in love with her. I would always be. I dont have much to say. JLA has made me love this series and even though I had to wait until the 3rd book to grow a love for Daemon, love Katy again, and finally be able to see them together, I think it was worth it. Im glad I kept going and didnt wait. I actually finished Obsidian and ordered Onyx right away because I wanted to see if anything new would happen and if my thoughts about the series would change. Not much happened but I didnt stop there, so I ordered the rest and here I am now, wanting to finish the series but not wanting to at the same time. Lux will probably end me because I constantly miss Daemon and Katy since they are so damn cute together. Im not expecting much from their relationship since it has shown so much and been taken to a new level, but I am expecting both of them to work together and see how their final journey will end and how everything will come to an end, to work out. I know Jennifer has done an amazing job with this series, so I have no low doubts but I have small expectations as well. Each involving the journey about to happen and the characters and see where they all will end up.
Oh my gosh, the rating is amazing. Ive never seen such a high rating for such a popular book! average of 4.62 out of more than 26000 people. WOW. Edit: Oh my god, I am desperate to read this book. This book is that kind of book that you dont have to read to know it will be amazing. I try to tell myself not to download the ebook version and wait to order it instead. Even if I have to wait at least a month to get it, I just know that the book is worth the wait. Edit 18 Jan 2013: FINALLY bought it at the bookstore today! Heard the paperback is finally out... Is half way through the book now and absolutely in love! Edit 19 Jan 2013: Amazing, Its definitely worth more than 5 stars. I dont know what to write because this book has completely left me out of words to say or write in this case. The Fault in Our Stars tells a story of how beautiful love is and how it doesnt matter if the two people arent perfect, its the love that counts. I will definitely be reviewing this book later but Im pretty sure I still wont do this book justice... Anyway, just want to give John Green a bow, this book is genius and amazing. Long live the nerdfighters!! Proper Review: I hate to write a review of a book that I love so much. Because I find myself ending up often annoyed and somewhat fidgety because I know I havent reviewed or expressed my feelings and thoughts clearly enough to do this book justice. Im honestly even frustrated right now just thinking about where to start and how to convey such powerful emotion I got from finishing this book into this word limited review. On the other hand, if I choose to not make any further comments on this, it feels as if Im betraying myself. I decided to write an honest review basically about how I feel and what Ive learnt on this journey with this book because Im sure a lot of people already know what the plot is all about.. So here I go. The Fault in Our Stars is amazing and beautifully written. I couldnt stress how much it changes how I view life as a whole. People often take their time for granted and never thought to stop once to appreciate such beautiful things around them. While I read this book, there is this quotation that keeps coming into my head and that is: Life is precious because it ends. John Green is brilliant and truly remarkable to create the wonderful Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who both fearlessly live their days as if it was their last. This novel is like a wakeup call to me and hopefully to a lot of other readers that life is fragile and so short; that love is found even in the most unexpected place in this case The Support Group, Hazel seems to hate so much at the beginning and in the most hopeless time. Even if their love lasts shortly, I believe that it doesnt mean their love isnt real or any less meaningful. Their love story got me crying like idiotic baby at my workplace full with people staring at me like they were dreading for me to start screaming and find a scissor to chop my hair. Life is so unfair, and the world is no wishgranting factory. It depends on how you look at life and the world itself, do you stop living and only wait for the sun to set each day not doing anything or do you embrace whatever comes along a thing at a time? Do you enjoy every second of life gracefully and optimistically or do you just stand there in the dark waiting miserably for it to rain harder? I adore the humor in this book, the light optimism that somehow finds its way in a conversation of these two fascinating characters. I honestly envy them. Not because they are surrounded by their family who loves and fully supports them, but because they make their lives matter, they make their lives significant in their own way that most healthy people couldnt do. They know and appreciate the power of love, they feel the warmth of being alive and I know they know the importance of time, all this in the midst of knowing that the end is near. How very inspiring and truly extraordinary. John Green mentions the ancient Greek word, hamartia, which means fatal flaw. Hamartia is not used that often but it strikes an impression on me for the reason is because everyone has one. Nobody is perfect. This book is a book full with flawed characters: Hazel and Augustus who are beautiful and funny but are cancer patients, Isaac who is hopeful and in love but ended up broken and blind, and Van Houten who is a great writer but an alcoholic and an asshole. However, their flaws intertwine and create a beautiful flawless story of hope and love. When I go through the description of how much pain the cancer patients, for instance, Hazel, has to struggle each day, it reminds me of my own father who has been unconscious and brain dead for 4 years since I was only thirteen. I feel as if I am going through another emotional phase of having to lose my father again when Augustus fell really ill at the end. From a person who completely understands what it feels like to lose someone you love and knowing that you can never get them back, John Green has done an amazing job at describing and conveying it. What hurts most is not the fact that theyre gone, but the pain comes from the memories you shared with the person you lost knowing that you can never make new ones but can only relive the ones you got inside your head. I learnt that John Green got the title of the book The Fault in Our Stars from a famous quotation from a Shakespeares play, Julius Caesar, when Cassius says: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.. Or in other words: Men can control their destinies. The reason that we are oppressed, dear Brutus, is not a matter of fate, but ourselves, because we dont do anything about it. In the old days, it was believed the location of stars and constellations depicted the future showing signs of good and bad omens. Cassius is saying that people control their own lives; however, they rely on things like stars to make their decisions for them and blame these stars when things go wrong which can be applied to religion as well. If you think about how John Green manipulates the quotation above into The Fault in Our Stars after knowing what the original one means then you will truly understand what the title implies. Stars in the title here represents fate and destiny. So, the fault or in other words the flaw, mistake, error, or a hamartia of the main characters  Hazel and Augustus  is not what they do or their actions but their own fate, the fact that they are ill and unhealthy and have a limited time, shorter than others, to live. The fact that they are unable to destine their own future even if they have the power to because god or in this case their stars draw a limit to their lives which if Im not looking too deep into this is a dramatic irony because the original quotation stated otherwise. Cassius says that we can destine our own destiny and that human has freewill but in this book freewill is applied but with limits. Augustus and Hazel fall in love with each other, go to Amsterdam to meet their favorite writer, kiss each other and even sleep together; however, they could not stop death from separating them apart. Despite the hardship that fate put them through, we are reminded that both characters do fall in love  and that is what matters most because love conquers all, even if death do them apart, Hazel will always have Augustus in her heart just like Augustus love for Hazel will live long after the collapse of our sun or even there is no one left to remember. Amen.
How do I feel about After You? First, when I say the title, I think someone is holding open a door for me. And Im ok with that, even though Im a feminist. As being a feminist doesnt mean that someone cant hold a door for you, at least not in my book. Especially when youre struggling to lug along a purse the size of a duffel bag because it is full of your kids med and whatnot. What being a feminist means for Louisas mum is something entirely strange, involving not shaving her legs and buying store bought cakes for Gramps birthday. Um, ok. That was weird. For a contemporary book, there were some seriously outdated notions in here. But maybe that is England, I dont know. Is Louisas dad really going to throw a flipping tantrum when the awful prospect of having SANDWICHES for Sunday lunch presents itself? Apparently, yes. I feel like I entered a time warp. But then I wasnt raised like Louisa. Even though my parents are quite conservative, and I dont think my mom would actually ever call herself a feminist Hi Mom! Feel free to opine : , they did set a good example of women and girls pursuing their education and careers. My mom went back to school and finished college while my brothers and I were in GRADE SCHOOL and graduated with honors, mind you when I was 10  oooooh, the horror. She left us with various babysitters when we werent in school and even left casseroles that we had to HEAT UP OURSELVES for dinners when she had night class, and this, back in the 1970s before we even had a microwave. The horror! Lets just say that my brothers have lots of stories of things not turning out as expected, or perhaps accidentally getting set on fire at our house while my parents were at work after we got off the bus and were supposed to be starting dinner in accordance with moms nearly illegible handwritten directions. Remember that time the pot holder caught fire and we threw it outside and scared the dog. Ha ha ha. Ok, so maybe my expectations for gender politics are beyond that of the average reader because of my advanced example of my parents. Mind you, my 78 year old father has never in his life changed a diaper. It wasnt Cagney and Lacy at my house. Ok, so the whole side plot of Louisas family and the conflict between her parents about her mothers new thirst for independence was a bit odd. I wouldnt expect not odd for Louisas parents though, so fine. Trina and Tom, good to see them again. I could have done without seeing weirdo Patrick jogging past their house, stopping to do squats right in front of Louisas window to show off his new fiancee. That was weird. And ishy. And completely unnecessary. Im glad Granddad was hanging in there too. Way to go, Granddad. Back to the main plot, Louisa, and her struggles with grief after Wills death at the end of the first book. Oh, sorry, spoiler alert, if you didnt read the first book yet, I think the title itself gives it away, but Will is dead. And now Louisa is trying, not always succeeding, to move on. Its been a bit of a wallow. There was crappy jobs in a number of cities, and nothing but short term one night relationships. In her latest crappy job, shes working at an Irish Pub themed bar at an airport, where she gets to wear an Irish dancing girl outfit. Ok, I have to admit, I like Irish dancing. My 10 year old son does it, and its been a wonderful outlet for him hes on the autism spectrum to get activity, lots of energy, but not have to compete and win or lose. And being surrounded by girls, less likely to have problems if he accidentally plows into someone while attempting to jig, as the boys are so few as to be a novelty in this dance school. So, I happily pictured Louisa doing jigs and reels all around the pub, but it is a rather lousy job. That Louisa stays at, because looking for a better job seems beyond her. Its a book about grief. As such, it is moderately successful. I rank it better than My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You Shes Sorry and Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer, but it isnt in the same league with Did You Ever Have a Family. If you are looking for a decent novel about grief, seriously, read the Bill Clegg book, and dont waste your time with the rest, or maybe this one after you finish that one. Louisa remains charming, but we all share Trinas and Sams frustration with her pace and her stagnation. Oh Louisa, seriously, lets move it along, shall we now? Then there is the surprise guest, a teen girl in need of a friend. She is a little annoying. Not Elsa from My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You Shes Sorry level of annoying, but on the right hand side of the bell curve for annoying 16 year old girls which mind you, is already a skewed set. I could have perhaps done with slightly less Lily in my life and in this novel. But how does it compare to Me Before You? Actually, I liked it a little better. I know, this isnt the conventional wisdom opinion. People LOVED Me Before You. But I didnt LOVE it. I thought it was ok, but I was very conflicted about Will and his decision. I empathized with Louisa, and enjoyed her sense of adventure and her loopy family. But Will, I wasnt a huge fan. I didnt think he seemed all the awesome of a person when he was the master of the universe business guru, and the depressed angry quadriplegic version didnt seem that much more compelling to me. I didnt buy the instalove they knew each other 6 months total, and was wondering just what was going on in Louisas head that she was so in love with him, when he really wasnt reciprocating because he was so depressed. Yikes. So, I liked this book better. The focus on Louisas grief journey was more realistic. I liked the people she met in her grief support group. And well EMT Sam, hes way more of a catch than angry depressed Will. But then, Im married to a retired firefighter  EMT, so I get the appeal of a man in uniform who rescues people for a living. That, with a nice personality and a hot bod, and hes building a house and raising fresh veggies. Well, that is way more appealing to me that Will, even without a castle and a fortune from his wealthy family and huge business success. But then I was apparently raised by raging feminists ha, I laugh, because they are so not but I did not ever see myself on the hunt for a prince to come provide a life of luxury for me based on my beauty. Im much more of a fan of lets do this together and make the most of what we have. Thanks mom and dad.
You know that feeling, she said, when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing close around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage, and you cannot let go or turn the course aside. This was essentially how Tessa and I approached the last book in Cassandra Clares Infernal Devices series. If you follow my blog at all you know that I have a pathological dislike of love triangles. I think the third book is where they usually fall apart, and I was upset by another triangle series that recently concluded that I had previously adored. Because this series has the trickiest love situation I have ever seen, I was very wary about starting Clockwork Princess. Thankfully, I have thus far had tremendous faith in Clares writing. I know she plots her series mercilessly, so I was hopeful that she would give her characters the ending they deserve, and that while undoubtedly painful, it would also be satisfying. In the end, I believe she accomplished exactly that. Of course, Ms. Clare doesnt make anything easy for her readers. Going into the final book in this series, she had created an impressively complicated knot of love between Will, Jem and Tessa. Lets break it down. Beware of SPOILERS for the previous 2 books in the listing, skip to the paragraph below this section if you havent read them. Jem loves Tessa. Tessa loves Jem. Will also loves Tessa. Tessa loves Will too. Will and Jem are best friends and parabati. Jem and Tessa are engaged. Jem does not know that Will loves Tessa. Will does not know that Tessa loves him back. Jem does not know that Tessa loves Will. Jem is dying. There is no cure for his disease. Jem dying will destroy Will. Jem dying will destroy Tessa. Will is determined not to benefit from Jems death and will not be with Tessa when Jem is gone. I dont think the fact that Tessa and I thought that she was barreling towards an enormous precipice of tragedy is that unreasonable under the circumstances. However, for me, the more important point about this complicated love triangle, and what has set it apart from any triangle Ive read before, is the fact that it is a true threeway relationship. Will, Tessa and Jem all love each other. If one of them falls, they ALL loose something. Throughout this story, I was continually amazed at how strongly Clare was able to emotionally tie them all together  and me to them. Even more, none of them had absolute power over the others, which is the case in most triangles where the girl is the one holding all the cards and essentially has to pick which heart to break. Every decisionoutcome came with a sacrifice for all of them. Another part of this story that I loved, for itself and also for how it enhanced the love triangle, was the Victorian setting. Clare for the most part kept her characters mentally within the confines of that world. People living in Victorian England lived under a very different set of social rules than we do today, including a strict code of propriety and decorum. I think the historical time period helped me to focus on the high emotional content of the triangle, without suffering through some of the more annoying features of most love triangles i.e. a constant back and forth between the two guys. Dont get me wrong, there are some great kissing scenes throughout this series, involving both guys. But that wasnt the focus of this series, as much as how their love for one another impacted each individual relationship. I think the story worked better because of that. Although for me, the main focus of Clockwork Princess  at least emotionally  was the love triangle, that is in no way all that happens in this book. These characters face very stressful life and death situations outside of their own personal dramas, especially from Mortmain and his Infernal Devices. If youve read the first two books and want a reminder about whats going on when this one begins, click here: At the start of the book, Mortmain is still out there plotting evil things with his mechanical devices, Benedict Lightwood has demon pox, Jessamine is in prison, Charlotte is pregnant and her position is being threatened by the Clave because shes a woman who thinks for herself, Gideon has left his family home and is in love with Sophie the maid, Cecily has just shown up at the institute, and of course most importantly Jem is dying, and there is no cure.  Amazingly, Clare ties off all the loose end from the previous books including questions about Tessas origins, and answers new ones from this book. There are also lots of incredible secondary characters, who have their own relationship issues, all of whose stories I was highly invested in. One of my favorite parts of this book was seeing the small connections between this series and the Mortal Instruments. You arent missing anything if youve not read both series, but it was a fun addition to the plot. Clockwork Princess is Cassandra Clares strongest written book. The story took me longer than it should have to read, because I was focusing so much on her characters incredible words and thoughts. Clare has said that this series is a loose retelling of A Tale of Two Cities, and the way that Dickens story weaves into this one, was particularly moving. One thing that continues to impress me about this author is how well she knows the inside of her characters, and as a result how very complex they all are. But most of all I appreciate the grace she has shown to Tessa, Will and Jem. Although this book is incredibly heartbreaking at times, and each of the three carries burdens and faces impossible sacrifices, I felt like they all would be proud of their place in this story and in each others lives. Love Triangle Factor: HIGH all around  but I still loved this book! Cliffhanger Scale: Series conclusion. Loose ends are tied. No room for a sequel for these characters. A personal note: As much as I loved this book, I still dont really understand love triangles. Although I got caught up in Tessas world, and can completely understand how you can love multiple people in your lifetime, I rolled my eyes a few times at how much Tessa was equally in love with both guys at the same time. I truly wanted it to work out for all of them  which is a testament to how well Clare crafted her characters and their story, but I think my heart will always romantically choose one over the other. But that just explains how amazing this series is, because I still believe that this triangle was extremely well done and satisfying, and that you should read it.
 spoiler alert  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has been called the 8th Harry Potter book. While this is true in number, it really isnt. I think one issue people have is that they expected this would feel like a direct continuation where the 7th book ended, like the magic and feeling would be exactly the same. But while it is the eighth Harry Potter book written about Harry Potter, I would say its a separate book with a different format and should be treated as such. Its also a play, which has been stated repeatedly, but people were expecting a novelization. I dont have issues reading plays, Ive done it growing up and I love dialogue and character interactions a lot more than anything else in books so this worked for me. Id say that this installment serves as a separate more satisfying epilogue than that last chapter that we received in book 7. I could go on about how that epilogue was one of the worst written chapters in history, but I wont. You get my drift. And part of me thinks that JK Rowling agrees, because she has given us this play. She must not have felt satisfied either. I am not actually going to speak too much about the basic plot except for the fact that it revolves around Albus Potter, Harrys second child, and Scorpio, Dracos son and their friendshiprelationship with each other and their fathers and trying to live up to or live apart from the expectations thereof. Ive seen complaints of how none of the original core group Harry, Hermione, and Ron are the same as in the books. They arent. They are in their 40s and now parents themselves. I thought in particular, with Harrys background, his character remained very true and consistent. I can only imagine having three children but all of his dearest father figures are dead his actual father, Dumbledore, Sirius Black, Lupin, and yes, even Snape. He must feel totally out of his element, in particular when dealing with Albus. I feel that Hermione and Ron also are very consistent. There are some issues with how Ginny and Ron are characterized, but honestly, the story is not about Ron, so while he has some of the best lines in the play other than Scorpio, he doesnt have a major role to play in the outcome. Ginny was never one of my favorite characters in the books, so if this is your favorite character, you may be disappointed. I felt she was a likeable and realistic character, playing a good foil to Harrys angst and issues being a father, but again, she doesnt play a vital role in what unfolds. I love the fact that Albus becomes a Slytherin. I think this is fantastic. I feel like the Slytherin house is completely underutilized in the original series, and honestly, are depicted as a Nazi group or Nazis in training without much three dimensionality to any of the characters including Draco, who is the most prominent Slytherin character throughout the series. I think its highly unlikely that all of the Slytherins were badevil kids that would definitely become evil people. Stereotyping a whole house like that never sat well with me. And I was hugely disappointed in the 7th book that all of them sided with the Death Eaters and then an entire house was forced to be jailed in the basement of Hogwarts. Draco too in this installment finally comes into his own. I felt it was clear from the books that Draco was not bad to the core, but had terrible parents, and was trying to just survive in a really terrible situation. While Harry had it hard for some reasons no parents, terrible adoptive parents, etc, I would say Draco had it worse can you imagine being told to kill Dumbledore??. Draco even says it at one point in this play, saying how jealous he was of Harry, to have this amazing core of 3 highly intelligent individuals who would back each other up through everything and together they were stronger than apart. I loved that Ginny also remarked that she was jealous of the trio. Draco had no one, just Crabbe and Goyle who hardly had a brain between them. And I loved how he fell in love with a woman who gave him a reason to change for the better, and then is trying his best to raise Scorpio. The fact that Scorpio is such an amazing character spoke the most to how Draco is as a father and how he must treat him so much differently than his own father treated him. I loved this so so much. Scorpio, oh Scorpio. I dont even know where to start. He is so amazing. A kind, loveable goofball with most of the scene stealers and best lines in the play. I love that he makes Albus see what a twit he is being later in the play. I mean seriously, while I get where Albus is coming from, he really does have it good in comparison to Scorpio, who has lost his mother and who everyone thinks is the son of the worst villain in the history of Wizardom. I absolutely love the time traveling in this book. I know there are problems with this. I am a scientist and usually time travel drives me crazy, but in this particular situation for me, it totally works. I love the idea of going back in time to change Cedric Diggorys death as this is when things started to take a turn for the worst. And then I LOVE the idea of alternate worlds, allowing us to explore what might have been, sort of like the best Choose Your Adventure book ever. Some of how this comes about is kind of ridiculous and honestly, lame, like how in one alternate world, Hermione and Ron dont get together and this apparently makes Hermione this old spinster teacher at Hogwarts who is really mean to everyone. But to me, this whole time traveling makes it possible for what I believe is the absolute best best BEST scene in the whole Harry Potter franchise, which is where Snape finds out from Scorpius that Harry in an alternate world has named his son after him. I didnt realize how much I needed to see this amazing scene, for this incredible man to recognize that his sacrifice wasnt for nothing and that he is remembered by Lilys son. I couldnt help but choke back a sob. The climax of the piece was also great, but for me, that was the shining moment that made this play completely worth it. I feel all of the emotional payoff in this story and most of the zingers in the dialogue are all vintage Rowling I did steal that phrase from my sister so she gets full credit. And I respectfully disagree with people who say that this reads like bad fanfic or that this doesnt sound like JK Rowling at all. Her imprint is all over this play. Overall, it wasnt perfect but I absolutely loved it and after reading it, felt an incredible satisfaction I didnt have after the 7th book, which to me, given what an incredibly hyped, beloved, and rich legacy this series has left the world, is a bit of a miracle. So just for that alone, I give it 5 stars. I hope that some of you have a similarly magical experience because it really is quite fantastic.
Forget tears or sobbing. Try ugly crying for like the entire last 30 or so pages. It was so hard to read but I couldnt look away. Never before has a book inflicted me with so much pain so easily. To be honest Im not even 100 sure what happened at the end but I know it fucking hurt. Picking up from Half Wild the witches are at war and the Alliance is doing there best to stand up against the council. Nathan is reeling from Marcuss death and is aiming to exact revenge on Annalise for her shooting him. However rumours abound of an amulet that make the wearer invincible and Nathan wonders if it would help him. This book is quite the journey and Sally Green is a very direct writer. It isnt flowery descriptions or flamboyant metaphors. Its blunt and harsh like Nathan. His perspective has grown so much from Half Bad and he is such a strange character that I love dearly. Hes broken but can be fixed but sometimes life is too hard. Spoilers ahead. Okay the scheming and planning for this book is so efficient. We dont get long debates because Celia is a brilliant leader. She knows whats up. She is not messing around. Even when Camp One is destroyed she is onto her next plan. The Hunters get an incline of their end plan and she powers on. She is absolutely leader goals. Nathan throughout he book has a lot of anger and for a while he directs it at anyone he can find. Its only after directing it at precious baby Gabriel and Gabriel getting angry with him that he begins to change. He focuses his anger mostly on Soul, Wallend and Annalise which is understandable. His main motivation is anger and revenge and thats fine. It works for him and it makes him so much more real. He also pushes himself so hard with his inherited Gifts and getting better and being powerful all because he has motivation. Even if its from a bad place it keeps him going right to the end. Action sequences in this book are hard and fast. Nathan taking down the band of Hunters at the beginning was violent and quick. Then he captures Donna who is an absolute cow. I hated her. From the minute she was introduced she sketchy. The whole sequence in the council building was absolutely intense. First Wallend catches him offguard with his weird potiony stuff but Nathan kills him anyway. Then Soul uses the one weakness of the amulet and almost wins but its Nathans hatred for Annalise that wins out. Then he kills Soul. This amulet was interesting because it could have been ridiculous. Invincible Nathan to the rescue every inch of the way. No because it had negatives. Plus the journey to Ledger was interesting. Ledger was interesting as a sort genderfluid aspect of witch Gifts. Also Ledgers hints of the Essence and what gave them the gifts feels like an easy way into a spinoff series. Nathan learned more about his powers and after all his resentment of witch bottles uses it to have the amulets protection. Its interesting. Then we have the visions. They can be cheesy or overly revealing. This gave us a tease. The first vision of him being shot I presumed was going to happen at the end. But it didnt it came to pass with bloody Donna shooting him and almost killing him. Then we get the second vision of him and Gabriel living happily. Which was so fucking cruel. There is no other way to describe it. It was brutal. Lastly Im going to talk about Nabriel. Because this ship tore me to pieces. Gabriel is totally in love with Nathan has been from practically day one. Nathan was hella confused about it all. But he did kind of make out with him in Half Wild and with Annalise out of the picture we get some brilliant Nabriel moments. Nathan being mean to Gabriel was tough but Gabriel lashing back was brilliant. Gabriel was more than a love interest he was strong in his own right. Nathan apologising to Gabriel gave me life. Then the kiss scene the kissing apology I should say. It was hot lets be real. Not only that but they consummated the relationship which can I just say is the first time Ive seen a lead consummate a relationship with two separate characters of opposite sex. They always talked about Wales and being happy after the war and then vision made me think for a moment we were going to get that. They were so happy when they were together. Even when they scouting the Roman Tower they captured little moments together. The hand holding, the sweet kisses I loved it so much. Then the end happened. The attack was going so well. But Jessica. This fucking bitch. She has Gabriel and Adele captive but Nathan manages to free them only it goes horribly wrong. Jessica is shooting at Nathan but the invincibility stops it from working. It deflects them. Into Gabriel who he was shielding. And Gabriel dies and its the single most horrible thing. Whats worse is that the moment before they could have saved him. Arran is there doing his best but Nathan has one gift he hasnt mastered properly. Well one important gift. He tries to stop time and give Arran more time but he cant do it to both of them. Instead we get him saying his final goodbyes to Gabriel as Gabriel is frozen moments before death. Then hes gone. And then the next chapter is all a bit weird. Because Nathan has basically fallen off the deep end. He keeps hoping or hallucinating Gabriel is still alive. But hes not. He took him to Wales and buried him. And he goes rabid. He sees Arran and Adele occasionally finds out he has a son from Annalise but hes broken beyond repair. And then Celia, I think its Celia comes and lives there. He brings her food in his animal form and draws lots but it brings back an old conversation he had. That if he can transform into living things can he change into a plant, specifically a tree. And he does the book ends with Celia reading stories to a tree. It broke my heart so much. Not only is Nathan basically gone so is Gabriel and Nabriel is dead and it hurt so much. The Half Life trilogy is important. It is a mainstream series with a young lead who questions his sexuality and plays both sides. He never states he is bisexual but he is somewhere around there on the spectrum and he has a solid relationship with a guy and a girl. He is such a fabulous lead and Nathan is so refreshing because he is such a modern teen in terms of his sexuality. Its okay to be confused and he was fine.
From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance Blog:  4.5 stars At A Glance Daughter of Smoke and Bone is not like any other book I have read before. The writing and imagery is beautiful and the premise is completely unique. I die a little inside every day having to wait for the second book to come out. The Good Heres the Story Karou has a unique life. Her days consist of drawing fantasy scenes in her sketch book, learning language through wishes, and collecting teeth for her monster friends. She was raised by monsters, nice monsters who have cared for her since birth and now have her collect teeth for a mysterious reason they have yet to reveal. Its a lonely life sometimes but at least she has some sort of family. Then everything changes when winged strangers mark certain doors around the world. These marks change Karous life forever. Now separated from her family, Karou finds solace with one of the winged beings who hates the monsters shes involved with but loves her for everything she cant remember. A New Favorite Author... The biggest thing I want to gush about is the beautiful writing. It was so descriptive and lyrical. It flowed flawlessly and rhythmically almost like a poem. I could picture everything in my head to precision. I almost feel like I had just watched a movie because all the pictures and scenes are still running through my head. Taylor knows her way around words, thats for sure. She built up the mystery and suspense in a way that made it hard to put this book down. And she is perfection when it comes to showing instead of telling. I cant wait to read more of Laini Talyors work. Karou... Karou, our bluehaired artist, was everything I would want in a protagonist. She has a mysterious past, she is smart, funny, and strong, and she has depth beyond imagining. I was drawn into her world and her role in it. I knew there was more to her than meets the eye and when all is revealed it is both heartbreaking and mesmerizing. Her part in the supernatural war is far more important than anyone can guess. Well, thats what I think anyways. Akiva... Akiva is on the opposing side of the war. But even though being with Karou is against all the rules, he cant help himself. He is drawn to her, its a pull that goes soul deep. He just has to convince her that she is more than just Karou. Akiva has many up hill battles ahead of him. His life is closely tied to Karous but he is hiding things that can ruin everything they ever had together. I feel bad for Akiva because I believe he is a great person but he has done some unforgivable things. But I have hope for him and Karou. Zuzana is the Sh!t... I had to give Karous best friend, Zuzana, her own paragraph. I just love everything about her. She is my favorite best friend character in all of bookland. She is beyond hilarious, she cares without prejudice, and...and...did I mention she was hilarious? I actually couldnt wait for her to come on the scene. You have to experience her to get what I am saying, its hard to explain her because I cant do her justice with just words, thats Lainis job. This is a SPOILER: I have to mention why I loved this story so much but it will spoil the surprise for some people who have yet to read Daughter of Smoke and Bone. You have been warned: I loved the concept of this story. Two races, the monsters below and the monsters above, call them demons and angels if you will. They both fight a war for war sake. They do not discuss compromises because neither will yeld to the other. And thousands are dying for reasons barely remembered. One side sees the war through gilded eyes and the other wants freedom but at the price of their souls. Neither will stop to see reason, which means this war is far from over. Is there ever really a winner when a society sacrifices its own to win a war? The Bad Only a few things to mention here. First, the POV shifting took me a little while to get use to but in the end I barely even noticed it. When I thought back to this book after reading the last page I realized not a lot happens for a portion of the book. The first half is amazing, descriptive and beautiful, then the second half focuses on Akiva and Karou and them doing...nothing. Bad, bad pacing on Lainis part. The whole point of this book is finding out who Karou really is, which we only find out in the end. When it comes to action and story climaxes, it lacked a little in the second half and then was awesome again at the end. The Snuggly There is definitely some yummy chemistry between Karou and Akiva. I like how deep their bond went, even farther than any of us could have imagined. It felt pure and...right. Any sexual activity or mention of it is YAish, so its pretty safe for the teenager crowd. But it is still very hot and romantic. I love everything about Karou and Akiva being together. Overall I enjoyed almost everything about Daughter of Smoke and Bone. It has mystery galore, it has a romance like no other, and we get left on a cliffhanger that was actually very exciting and not annoying like so many other cliffhangers I have read. This might just be my next favorite series. Highly recommended. Quotes Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe theres no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic.  She craved a presence beside her, solid. Fingertips light at the nape of her neck and a voice meeting hers in the dark. Someone who would wait with an umbrella to walk her home in the rain, and smile like sunshine when he saw her coming. Who would dance with her on her balcony, keep his promises and know her secrets, and make a tiny world wherever he was, with just her and his arms and his whisper and her trust.  It is a condition of monsters that they do not perceive themselves as such. The dragon, you know, hunkered in the village devouring maidens, heard the townsfolk cry Monster! and looked behind him.
This review is also available on my blog, Qwerty Some may say that you should never read a book because of the author. But looking at numerous cases of authors throwing temper tantrum throughout this year especially, Id say, I am one of those people who would read a book because of the author. Call me judgmental, but I think the readers deserve to be appreciated and treated with respect especially when they spent their hardearned money for your book. David Estes is one of my GR friends, he was the one who added me. We dont interact very often because usually he reads books which I havent read or have no interest to read. I am not very comfortable with the idea that he has more than 1200 friends, he rated his own books five stars, he voted for his books on listopia and he likes the positive reviews Im not sure what he does to the negative reviews, probably just not responding to them. But I guess as an indie author, you have to be out there, promoting your books, or who else is going to do that. As his updates keep popping on my newsfeed, my initial skepticism slowly diffuses away. Hes on GR mostly TO READ, he responds nicely to comments on his updates, he is active in group discussion, and I thought Wow! This guy is really nice. I must read his books no matter what. I got Angel Evolution sitting on my tablet but as soon as I found out The Moon Dwellers was almost out, I was more drawn to this book as its the latest and should be the best book yet by David Estes. So, there you have it, my story of how I decided to pick this up. : First, I have to take my words back. This book is nothing like Legend. What made me feel like that at the start was because we got these two main characters coming from two ends of spectrum in a dystopian society, Tristan and Adele. And oh, how sweet the author is to name Adele after his wifes name  What I liked: 1. I wasnt impressed with the cover at first. But it sort of grows on me. The colour scheme is really nice and IT ACTUALLY FITS WITH THE STORY. Oh well,I guess Im just tired with girlinaprettydresscover that makes no sense whatsoever with the story itself. 2. The characters. I think this is a first book Ive ever read where the male lead actually has a male best friend. And its so appealing because the bromance is portrayed with such loyalty and purity. My favourite character is Roc, hands down. Hes cocky and funny, I think the story would lose its luster without him. 3. The writing was very neat and precise. I read this in the plane, during a transit, in the next plane, and at the airport. I usually have trouble reading in public because for start, I do show my emotions while reading which is quite embarrassing, second; well, for obvious reason, I need total silence to concentrate on the story. But reading The Moon Dwellers was effortless, you can easily get back to the story if you got distracted. Haha! 4. Some of the scenes were very moving. Coles background, Elsey and Adele reunion, Coles death, Rocs loyalty. 5. The romance is very sweet and innocent. Damn it! Tristan is such a sweetheart. To counter the insta love, see things I didnt like below, the author was very clever to shape Adele and Tristan relationship slowly and steadily after they finally met. They were just holding hands for God sake, and I was already squealing in my seat. It is just so nice to find a book with this kind of clean romance. Ill gladly recommend this book for my 16 years old niece. 6. The fight scenes were told in specific details and well, made sense. Not just, he punches me, I block the blow yada yada. 7. The right emotions were shown by the characters at the right time. For example, Adele still remembered the lost of her friend, Cole when she finally be with Tristan. What I didnt like: 1. Guess it. Itas if theres an invisible tether between our eyes linking us together. There is no doubt I felt something for him. I feel something for him. Although from a distance her eyes look dark. I know they are a deep, enchanting green, almost feline. I half expect them to glow in the dark. Nonsense! All nonsense! I cant possibly know what color her eyes are as if I know her. Ive never met her. Oh Lord, the insta love. No, wait. The ala Disney insta love which is worse. Honestly, I dont know how to keep the story going if the author lets the attraction between Tristan and Adele grows slowly because the story dictates that they hardly had a chance to see each other. 2. This book lacks that special something. While the premise is refreshing, at the end of the book, it reached a point where almost all dystopian books have been there The Hunger Games, Divergent, Shatter Me. A chance for a revolution. Again, if we minus that, it would still come short from earning five stars from me because it is not one of those books where I found it impossible to put down and I got a book hungover long after I finished it. Its good, no question about that, but it doesnt stay in my heart. 3. The awkward analogies and similes. Have human lives become like a tube of toothpaste? Something to be used up and thrown away? Her beauty resonates from her like radiation from uranium. 4. Sort of. This phase appears 17 times. Thats A LOT. 5. Sometimes, the plot just got too convenient. The explosions detonated at the right time, Tristan saw Rivet chasing Adele at the perfect moment and so on. The story seems to be planned, too well planned. I wished for more spontaneity. So, the verdict: 7 pros versus 5 cons. Congratulations to David Estes for earning more plus points from me; a reviewer who is very hard to be pleased. Hehe.
Rating: 3.5 Stars It has been said before, but it bears repeating: Me Before You is not a love story. In fact, despite the fact that this mantra has been stated and restated in nearly all of the reviews Ive read of this book, I still got it into my head that it was a romance and a damn depressing one at that, considering the subject matter. Well. Its not a romance. And its not quite depressing, just...sad. But only in parts. Me Before You follows Lou, a bright young girl who has never left the comfort of her hometown. For Lou, working in the cafe, visiting her steady boyfriend, and staying with her parents is a perfectly respectable life. She isnt the ambitious daughter that her sister is, but she also isnt a singlemother the way her sister is, which seems to balance out the ordinariness of her life perfectly. When Lous cafe shuts down, however, leaving her jobless at a time when her parents need the cash flow, she decides to take on a job as a carer, caring for Will Traynor. Will lived a vivacious life, scaling dangerous mountains, skiing down steep inclines, trekking through vast jungles...you name it, Will has been there and done it. Until, that is, a car accident leaves him paralyzed, stuck in a wheelchair and unable to do much on his own. For the past two years, Wills life has consisted of hospital visits, listening to the radio, reading novels, and watching the television. For a former adventurer, it isnt much of a life, particularly when there is practically zero chance of his condition improving. When Lou enters Wills life, hes bitter and sarcastic, unwilling to succumb to her natural goodwill and charm. Naturally, hes furious with the cards life has dealt him and, coupled with the fact that his exgirlfriend and former coworker are engaged to be married soon, his temper is caustic. Lou, used to the genial atmosphere of the cafe where customers greet her, speak to her, and want to meet her, is taken aback by Wills temperament and is reluctant to continue her position. However, knowing her family needs the money, Lou persists, visiting Will with a tentative smile day after day, despite the fact that his mother terrifies her and him more so. But, the relationship that develops between Will and Lou is so, so precious. Both of them come to a slow compromise, learning to get along, and eventually that develops into a tight friendship neither than step away from. Will, despite his cynical outlook on life, is surprised by Lous small existence and takes it upon himself to expand her horizons, introducing her to foreign films, different novels, and world news. Lou, in turn, opens Will up from his despondent lifestyle, forcing him to see the small miracles in lifeeven his own. What I appreciate about Me Before You, though, is the fact that Moyes never sugarcoats their relationship. Although Will and Lou are beginning to get along, Will constantly has his bad days; days when sickness keeps him in bed, days when the injustice of his situation hits him anew, days when he cant leave his house without feeling embarrassedwithout feeling like a burden to those around him. As these feelings fester inside him, they bring along with them a fresh slew of problems as Will must consider whether or not he truly wants to live for a desperate few more years in pain or simply end his life while he can. Its a disturbing situation, but one Moyes deals with aplomb, which I greatly admire. From her nononsense writing style to her matteroffact prose, she never romanticizes the predicament Will is in, which only makes this story all the more heartbreaking. Of course, there is a fair dose of romance in this novel as Lou falls in love with the man Will still is, but her Will and the Will before the accident are two entirely different men who Will himself cannot reconcile, which presents issues in their relationship. Whats more, Wills disability prevents him from pursuing a relationship with Lou in the way he truly wants to and the weight of that sacrifice weighs upon him, nearly always. In the midst of these inner turmoils, though, Moyesquite unnecessarilythrows in a variety of other hurdles. Most notably, Lous longtime boyfriend, Patrick. Patricks presence in Me Before You is a mere annoyance, simply because his character lacks development. Patrick and Lou are an easy, convenient coupleone whose spark has long since died. Patrick is now focused on marathon training while Lou becomes increasingly involved in her new job as Wills carer, which only further wedges the gap between them. For me, their relationship never felt like a true obstacle in Lous path and though it further represented the comfortable bubble she lived in, it lacked true purpose throughout the story. Me Before You is solely Will and Lous story, thus the twodimensional and flat secondary characters merely acted as roadblocks in the pacing of this story. Even with side characters such as Wills parents, his nurse, or Lous family members, Moyes attempted to develop them by featuring one sole chapter interspersed in the narrative from their perspective instead of Lous. While these chapters certainly shed more light on these characters, it felt cumbersome in such an allconsuming tale such as this one. Id have loved to see these secondary character further developedperhaps through more than one chapter from their perspectivebut this taste of depth which Moyes provided wound up being far more detrimental to the storyline. Another point of contention for me in Moyes acclaimed novel is the viewpoint shared of a life wellspent. At some point in Me Before You, the message of this novel became lost amidst the contentious tension between Will and Lou and their fate. Its an emotional ride, which I can appreciate, but I do not think I am alone in claiming that readers will likely close this novel feeling a range of feeling instead of reflecting on the themes Moyes hastoo subtlyweaved through this tale. Me Before You is all about living your life; really living your life. Its about encouraging people to go out there, leave their comfort zones, and experience the vastness of the planet we live on. However, while these are incredible messages to get across, I dislike the fact that Will is rich and privileged, enabling him to live the type of vibrant lifestyle he considers worthy. Its a complaint Ive seen emerge from novels such as Gayle Formans Just One Day duology, but where that series differs for me is in the fact that Allyson, the protagonist, finds ways to make her life meaningful by simply making friends, meeting people, and attending new classes. Forman, though writing of rich characters who have the money to travel the world, never fails to mention that life just can be just as profound and worthy doing small, meaningful activities opposed to the grand gestures of cinema. Now, thats not to say that Moyes misses this message entirelyfor she doesntbut I felt as if it became buried under Wills constant advice for Lou to travel to the places he had been and leave her hometown. Instead, what I wanted was the acknowledgement that though Wills life felt fulfilling because of his adventures, the lives of people such as Lous parents could also be considered more than fulfilling because of the love and family and support present in their lives. John Green, in The Fault in Our Stars, writes of how each and every one of us want to achieve greatness and make our mark on the world, but often the most profound manner in which we achieve that is by making a mark on the people around us. Moyes has written a novel that follows these messages perfectly, but the fact that I never felt itthat such important themes were never palpable on the page the way the feelings and lives of these characters wereis slightly disappointing. Nevertheless, Me Before You is widely loved by many, many readers and, trust me, theyre not wrong. Although I have my fair share of qualms with this novel, it still remains an excellent reademotional, thoughtprovoking, and educational. It isnt your typical contemporary read, but perhaps thats what makes it so special.
So... I was very uncertain about this book. I wasnt even sure if I should request it but a lot of people were liking it, so I thought to give it a shot. The problem is, the impression I got was of a sad story about a girl struggling with cancer, doing a list of things before she inevitably dies, but then bam, shes alive and faces the consequences of her actions, but you as a reader deal with it alongside her and you all get closure or growth or whatnot. All right, essentially this is what the book is about more or less BUT I didnt get closure. Or sense much growth. Im giving you guys a rant warning here, there may be spoilers. Alice was diagnosed with cancer, and the first thing that came to mind to her when she thought she was going to die soon was to make a list of things she wanted to do before she died. She couldnt do it alone so she recruited her once upon a time close friend who shes pretty sure loves her to help her scheme and accomplish things. All goes well for Alice until she goes into remission... then? Not so much. She has to face the consequences of her scheming, which is not something she had counted on. The idea of the story was intriguing at most. The going back and forth in point of views between Harvey and Alice both now and in the past, wasnt the best part of the story since there was no chronological order to the now and then, it could take place any time in the past and any time in the assumed present. I was prepared to deal with the entire book and hoping to be pleasantly surprised by the turn of things, and hopefully enjoy the book. I was pleasantly surprised, but sadly, not for long. What I didnt anticipate was hating the protagonist so very much. I think Alice is one of the worst people ever. Shes the most ridiculously selfcentered, selfish, arrogant, egocentric, and vindictive people Ive read about in quite some time. I guess one of the great things of having a religion or faith or even Karma, is that when life hands you bad news, like really really bad news, as in your much closer than anticipated imminent death, you kind of start thinking of your purpose in life, what youre leaving behind, what your legacy would be, how people will remember you. You start thinking about praying, or making it up for people, or helping others deal with your death when your gone. But oh no, definitely not Alice. I laughed. We were so different. Harvey wanted good. He wanted to leave the ones he loved in a good place. Id just wanted the last word. But I wouldnt be sorry for that now. Its too late for sorry. Instead of trying to forgive the transgressions that were committed against her, instead of thinking above it all, since shes dying and should probably be at peace rather than anything else, she plots her revenge. She wants to cause havoc, wreck things and people, so she can remain the centre of attention. All she cared about was making the year she was going to be alive for the most heavenly experience for herself, and if it included Harvey  because hello he makes her happy  then so be it. Who cares if this experience was tearing him apart? Who cares if he would never recover from the experience when she was gone? Who cares if she was potentially scarring him for life? What mattered was that she got what she wanted, how she wanted, when she wanted, and thats that. Why think of what she wouldnt be there to witness anyway? I think Im going to die. There was an eerie calm to her voice that terrified me more intensely than any cancer. Dont say that, Alice. We all die. We are dying. Im just in the fast lane, I guess, dying faster than the rest of you slugs. The most thing I personally loathed her for, was her treatment of Harvey. Shed ignored him for years, but once she was about to die, she decided she might as well let him in her life again, because now that she has an expiration date, she can let him love her the way hed always wanted to and just give him hope for the year she was staying alive. She dragged him through hell, put his heart on a freaking grinder and just tore him to pieces. Over and over and over again. She kept leading him on, giving the poor guy the impression his feelings were reciprocated and that even though she was dying, they were something. Until of course she was in remission and the poor lad excited over the potential of a future between them realizes that the Alice that survived was back to the one before she was diagnosed with cancer. Except much worse. I was upset for the poor guy. The thing is, she didnt want to be with him anymore, she treated him like freaking crap, but she had the gall to not want him with anyone else either. Id always heard that when you truly love someone, youre happy for them as long as theyre happy. But thats a lie. Thats higherroad bull shit. If you love someone so much, why the hell would you be happy to see them with anyone else? I didnt want the easy kind of love. I wanted the crazy love, the kind of love that created and destroyed all at the same time. And boy did she destroy. The problem is, I never got why Harvey loved her in the first place, not one freaking redeeming quality in this atrocious human being. Okay fine, Ill give her one act of kindness. But thats not enough to love someone so heinous, full of hatred and ugliness inside, so not worth it. Whenever Harvey talked about why he loved her, there was nothing solid, nothing from her core, just that she was a beautiful dancer, he loved her looks... I dont know, nothing about why he loved her made her sound like a person that one could love. More like an addictive drug thats so horrible for you but might seem just good at the time, except later on you realize the amount of damage its inflicted, the harm it can do and you still come back for more. Harvey was one of the most singularly amazing people out there. I think I would have had a very big book crush on him if it wasnt for the fact that he was a doormat to Alice, a slave of her every whim, no backbone to actually save and protect himself from her. The poor guy was a hopeless goner. His life turned upside down when hearing she might be taken away from him for good. I have leukemia, Harvey. Your life changes sometimes and it only takes a few words to bridge the gap between now and then. In conclusion, the story had an interesting plot. However, hating Alice and her character as much as I did, made it very difficult to appreciate it. Alice did attempt to redeem herself, but not in anyway that matters. I didnt get the right confrontations, I didnt get to see her understand how screwed up she made everyone, she never got to understand how wrong she was to treat Harvey the way she did, not in a way that counts. I didnt get closure, I was more angry by the ending than anything. Rating: 25.
I want to start my review by saying that I did thoroughly enjoy this book. It won the vote on what I should read next, and so many of you were recommending it. I am so glad that you did, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Im just going to admit it right now that it isnt a 55 read for me, like it was for so many of you. There are just a few things that bugged me when I was reading that stopped it from becoming a perfect read for me. There was just one small aspect of the story that wasnt explained properly, it made it feel like a really huge plot hole. Plot holes grate on me so much when I am reading, I really obsess over them and that takes away from my enjoyment of the book. Hopefully this part will be explained in greater detail in part two, so that it will make more sense to me. Im going to move on from the plot hole issue for now and instead concentrate on why I absolutely adored this beauty of a book. First of all, I must comment on the writing  its beyond stunning! Renee Ahdieh really brings this world to life, with all the vivid descriptions of the landscapes, the buildings, the clothes and, lets not forget, the food. Her descriptions of the food actually had my mouth watering and my stomach rumbling. I truly longed to fall into this world, just so I could devour all of the delicious food she was describing  usually book descriptions have zero affect on me. Next we have the characters, and there are quite a lot of them in this book. I love complex characters and there are so many of them here, characters I know we have barely scratched the surface of so far. Everyone had their own distinct personality, and they all had different motives that were driving them. Shahrzad fascinated me, especially since she willingly offered to be sent to the palace to marry the Caliph. Shes strong and determined, good with a weapon, and is a girl with a mission. She lost her best friend to the Caliph, and she wants her revenge. But then shes conflicted and torn, and I loved that side to her. Khalid is more of an enigma, a puzzle that needs solving. You know there is more to him then we initially know. We are well aware of the fact that he kills his brides the day following the wedding, but we are not sure why. Its obvious to us that he isnt just doing it for laughs, or because he loves a great hanging in the morning! Tariq is a character that I actually really loved, even though he seemed to annoy so many people. He is Shahrzads childhood sweetheart, and he is determined to rescue her from the Caliph. Many didnt seem to like him, but I think they hated him because he got in the way of the romance between Khalid and Shahrzad. Im a huge fan of the childhood sweethearts though, so I was cheering for Tariq for the majority of this book. Plus, the guy has a pet falcon! And that is just fucking awesome. This book was wonderful and it kept me reading. But it didnt completely blow my mind as much as I had hoped. I think the sequel has the potential to become a 55 favourite, as long as it explores the plot hole issue. Now, time to discuss my issue. Its spoilery so highlight at your own risk people!!! My only problem with this book came into play once the whole curse aspect was revealed. My first issue was that I was a little disappointed with that explanation. At the beginning it mentions the rain has stopped, and that things were going wrong. I thought he had agreed to some kind of deal, where he was saving his people and Kingdom by agreeing to kill the 100 people. Its still sad and horrible, but it would make it seem a little more noble in some ways. But, nope, just an angry father seeking revenge. That didnt make too much sense to me as it really wasnt Khalids fault. He didnt make his wife miscarry. He didnt make his wife commit suicide. So, maybe he wasnt madly in love with her but most royal marriages werent based on love. My other big issue with the curse was how horribly unspecific it was. I feel it should have to be as specific as wishes have to be, where you have to be super clear exactly what you want. It just seems like it only states 100 lives for the 1 you took. There is no mention of those lives having to be female. No mention that they have to get married to Khalid. So why is he marrying all these women and killing them?!? Is this explained at all? Did I miss that?!? This bugged me the whole time I was reading. The guy needed to make his curse way more specific, otherwise what is stopping Khalid just getting a criminal every morning and hanging them?!? SOMEONE TELL ME, IM GOING CRAZY!!! 45 Butterflies I absolutely loved this book, if it wasnt for that one small issue it would have been a 55 read for sure. This was the Arabian Nights retelling I had been hoping for when I tried A Thousand Nights. I cant wait to see where the story goes in the sequel.
Its not a confession if no one reads it. Its just an unshared secret. THE STORY: Becca: I actually went into Confess completely blind, having read the synopsis quite some time ago I decided to avoid reading anything else so that I could go in with an open mind and no premonition of what was to come. Besides knowing that it would have something do with Art I was clueless. That is my favorite way to go into a book movies too! This approach really worked with how Colleen Hoover built this story. Bits and pieces about both main characters lives are introduced throughout the story until at the end we have a complete picture of not only their past, present and future, but also a clear picture of who both Owen and Auburn are. I really cannot reveal too much about the story without spoiling it, but I will see that as things were revealed Lisa and I were texting back and forth OMG! and then OMG AGAIN!! and by the way for those who have read this.. pun intended on the OMG! Oh and by the way... that prologue?! It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read, it sets the tone for the entire story and once I read that I was completely hooked! I was so enraptured by Confess that I did not want to put it down! Once again Colleen Hoover has worked her epic, magic, writing genius and my love her has grown grown even more! I love you so much. His voice is breathless and full of fear. Ill love you forever. Even when I cant. My tears fall harder at his words. And Ill love you forever. Even when I shouldnt. Lisa: CoHo, you can do no wrong in my eyes. You continue to blow me away with your creative writing style, insanely gorgeous words, and knack for pulling your readers in instantly and never letting go. Beccas definitely right about that prologue. It was so, so beautiful. Sweet, and sad, and definitely set the stage for story. Like Becca, I went into this story with no idea whatsoever about what I was going to encounter. I rarely read descriptions, so this is the norm for me. I just love going into a story with a blank slate. And with Colleen especially, this always pays off. The way she tells a story with so many questions, then revealing bits and pieces throughout, is one of my very favorite things about her. It definitely encourages the I cannot stop reading!!! behaviors we all struggle with from time to time. ; Shes like a light, unwittingly brightening up the darkest corners of a mans soul. THE CHARACTERS: Lisa: This beautiful story is told through the alternating points of view of both Auburn and Owen. Oh, how I love me some dual narration!! Auburn has relocated recently, living with a girl she just met in a small apartment near the salon where she works. She has her entire life planned out for her... minus the part where she needs more money. And fast. She stumbles upon an art studio looking for an assistant where she can make some major money, so she immediately agrees to the job. This is where she meets Owen, the studios owner. Owen was a bit of an enigma at first. Even though we have the pleasure of his voice for a lot of the book, at the beginning I wasnt quite sure on how I felt about him. He had a few secrets, and I unsure of whether I would want to smack him or hug him as the story progressed. This is one of the things I love most about Colleen Hoover and her ninja writing skills... so many secrets that really keep you guessing until they are finally revealed... and then... SO MANY FEELS! Good feels, bad feels, ugly feels... she brings them all out of me! Oh, Colleen... how you torture me so! Owen smiles, and I suddenly wish we were in the cleaning aisle, because someone is going to have to mop me up off this floor. Becca: So many feels is right and this book had them all! I would go from grinning, to crying and then to irrationally angry as I read! But these were all good things because each emotion was an integral part of the story! I liked Auburn a lot, she was so strong and her perseverance was one of the things I loved the most about her! As I learned more about her, my heart went out to her. She worked so hard for everything and never gave up on what she wanted, no matter how hard it was. Lisa is right about Owen, I wasnt too sure about him either. My head couldnt decided if it should trust him, but my heart was screaming at me to do so! His creative mind was absolutely beautiful! The way that he thought and spoke was as if his words were painted with colors and it was magical. The art workpaintings are such a major part of this book. Because we had an EARC we did not get to see the paintings and it made me so sad : Luckily, I received my preorder in the mail shortly after finishing and I immediately searched through to reread the passages and look at te art work... OMG the paintings are AMAZING!!!!! I seriously just stared at them and petted them while my brain soaked them in! By the way, the Artists name not its not Owen LOL is Danny OConnor :D I tilt my face toward her neck and inhale the scent of her. If her smell had a color, it would be pink. Sweet and innocent with a touch of roses. OVERALL: Becca: Once again, Colleen Hoover has amazed me! She is so talented and her writing speaks to my soul. I will continue to devour any and everything that she writes because her ability to incorporate real characters and beautiful stories packed with so many feels keeps me coming back for more! I had a serious book hangover after reading Confess, I was still so in love with Auburn and Owen and the amazing art that I had to give my brain and heart time to recuperate! If you have not read this yet, DO IT! Trust me, I dont think that you will be disappointed! Lisa: As Ive said before and will continue to say, I always rate books based on how they make me feel, and not necessarily on any technical aspects. Because of this, I have zero hesitation about rating this book a full 5 stars. I loved it. From page one I connected with this book, and it never faltered. Im continually blown away by Colleen Hoovers talent in writing such realistic and shockinglydefined stories. Her mind is a powerful tool, and I feel lucky to have the chance to experience it when reading her books. Once again, Colleen has made me feel things. ALL the things. And I couldnt be happier. If you enjoy Colleens books Are there really people out there that DONT enjoy her books?! this is one you will not want to miss!
To read more of my book reviews visit, Crawling Over The Pages. THE COVER. As book readers say, Do not judge a book by its cover. Well, honestly, sometimes its the book cover that attracts my attention. Im just human, you know. I got excited when I see a good book cover. As you can see, the cover of Me Before You doesnt speak volumes about the book. Its kind of dull. But then, it wasnt the book cover that got me into this. It was in my recommended shelf in Goodreads. The blurb of the book was enough for me to give it a try plus it has positive reviews. I assure you this is a brilliant book and dont let the book cover discourage you from reading this. WILL TRAYNOR. An adrenaline rush junkie. A motorbike enthusiast. A company CEO. A city whiz kid. Stunt diver. A woman magnate. A lover. A traveler. A sport enthusiast. This was before the accident that almost took his life. He was just an innocent pedestrian when a motorist skidded towards him leaving him crippled and turning him into a quadriplegic. FAST FORWARD TWO YEARS LATER. Everyone else was beginning to move on but not his family. Wills girlfriend, Alicia, is going to marry Rupert, his bestfriend. His father is trapped. He decided to live with Will and sacrifice his chance to live with the woman he loves. Will, on the other hand, will forever be trapped in his wheel chair and will always be dependent on someone elses help. He cant be the same person he was 2 years ago. Then he requests for the unthinkable  that his family take him to Dignitas. His family were in denial and they want him to think it over. So he agreed to give them 6 months more. With her mothers desperation to change his mind, she hired a carer and offered her a high compensation to make Will change his mind. MEET LOUISA CLARK. The carer, a woman of character, unemployed, has a boyfriend who is far more enthusiastic about his change of career plans than her, a family who depends on her, and has a quirky fashion sense. She and her boss didnt get along at first but when she began to treat him like a normal person not like some invalid and addresses his being an arse to his face, they slowly clicked together. This was just the beginning of the most wonderful six months of their lives. She changed Wills perception about life. She cheered him and made him laugh. She made him look forward to waking up each morning. She made him appreciate peoples good intentions. Will, on the other hand, gave her freedom. He made her do things she thought she cannot do. She traveled, tried water skiing, sailing, and also scuba diving. He made her give a serious thought about going back to the university again. He brought her out of her comfort zone. She watched movies with subtitles with him, read books he recommended and even attended an orchestra concert. He made her let go of her fears and unleash her love for adventure. She started going to library, doing research on Internet and organizing ideas and travels she wants Will to do. I guess it was faith that brought them together. They brought out the best from each other. THE PLOT. This is one of those stories which will make you think of your judgment. Am I doing the right thing? Will it be alright? Well, its really difficult to give my own judgment in this kind of situation. If I were in Wills case, I wont be so sure if I have the will to live and wake up each morning knowing that I wont be able to do what I love to do anymore. Imagine all the things he was before the accident. I dont think he can accept being in a wheel chair and under medicine maintenance for the rest of his life. So heres the thing. He wants to go to Dignitas, which is in Switzerland, to commit suicide with the assistance of his parents. This involves morality issues. Its a very sensitive matter indeed. I was kinda horrified when Camilla agreed with Wills requests but then Jojo Moyes made several references about cases which was the same with this plot and which happened in real life. I know that it may be the hardest decision a mother may face in her life. I can definitely understand her. There are moments in this book that I just wished hell just be dead so he wont feel the pain anymore. And there were moments when I wishfully think that some miracle might happen and hell be able to walk again. The point is Im not the one facing Wills problem. I wont be able to feel the pain and loneliness he feels. So I guess, I wont judge his mother for allowing him to do it because its his own life. Hes the only one who knows whats best for him. He had his own battles that only him can fight and Ill respect his decision if thats what makes him happy. THE END. Lou and Will fell for each other but Will doesnt want Lou to sacrifice her happiness for him. So for the last hurray before Dignitas, they went to travel with Nathan. They enjoyed the peacefulness of their surrounding and did what any normal couples do. But at the end of their vacation, Will requested for the inevitable  for Lou to accompany him to Dignitas. That was probably one of the worst case scenario a couple could end up into. I cried a bucket of tears. Its just so heartbreaking. The most touching part was when she lied with him on the bed inside the Dignitas and they were just staring at each other as if trying to memorize everything before he departs. That was so sad. I lay down facing him. I saw the clock above the door and had a sudden sense of time running out. I took his arm, threading my won arms and legs around him so that we were tightly entwined. I took his hand  the good one  and wrapped my fingers in his, kissing the knuckles as I felt his squeeze mine. His body was so familiar to me now. I knew it in a way I had never known Patricks  its strength and vulnerabilities, its scars and scents. I placed my face so close to his that his features, became indistinct, and I began to lose myself in him. I stoked his hair, his skin, his brow, with my fingertips, tears sliding unchecked down my cheeks, my nose against his, and all the time he watched me silently, studying me intently as if he were storing each molecule of me away. He was already retreating, with drawing to somewhere I couldnt reach him. I realized I was afraid of living without him. How is it you have the right to destroy my life, I wanted to demand of him, but Im not allowed a say in yours? A NEW BEGINNING. To her surprise, Will included Louisa in his last will and testament, giving her a bank account that can buy her a pleasant house to live in and can support her 4 year education full time. But before she get the full amount, he sent her to Rue des Francs Bourgeois in France. The place where he wanted to go with her. After which, Lou read the letter he gave her. Its kind of sad how their story ended but I guess thats just how life is. Its one of those stories that can still make you smile even though it makes you want to cry. This is just how its supposed to end because if Will decided to give their relationship a try, it might end up differently or rather tragically. He gave her a new beginning in the end  something she looks forward to. Quotes from the Book The thing about being catapulted into a whole new life  or at least showed up so hard against someone elses life that you might as well have your face pressed against their window  is that it forces you to rethink your idea of who you are. Or how you might seem to other people. Some mistakes...just have greater consequence than others. But you dont have to let it be the thing that define you.
3 stars! Overall, I enjoyed this read, but I have some issues. Ultimately, it had so much potential but so many aspects fell flat for me. Ill be discussing this book with my book club The Biblio Book Club on 817 at 9:30 PM EST at  come join! I liked the beginning of the book the best. The first third of the book was fresh, exciting, new, and magical! I havent read a mermaid book since I was a kid and forgot how much fun they could be. The middle was fairly boring in my opinion, and the ending was far too fast paced and problematic in regards to the relationship for me to really enjoy it. Also, the ending felt like it was wrapped up in a bow. Theres obviously more work to be done in the world that we dont get to see, but almost every issue seemed like it was fixed. I thought the world was particularly controversial and interesting. It feels as if its a commentary on the patriarchy where a womans worth is reduced to their fertility, and our main character aims to break from the system and live the life she chooses. I think for the most part, this viewpoint is expressed as being degrading and damaging, but there are some lines that promote these ideals that I feel should have been more harshly denounced. For example, infertile women are referred to as broken throughout the story, sometimes they are mocked for having low fertility, and I think the way it was addressed sometimes contributes to this ideology as opposed to critiquing it. Overall, it was a bold risk and for the most part, it was done well, but there were absolutely areas that could have been improved on. The story arc that really captured me was Ersel attempting to outwit Loki, to fulfill her wishes. I think they were the more clever scenes in the story, especially the final point in this plotline, and I really wanted more. I wish more of the story had been filled with quests from Loki and Ersels attempts to have them backfire on the god. It was fresh and unique, and I really enjoyed it. I have to say Im a little disappointed with it as a retelling, which may have been a result of my expectations. This was sold to me as a Little Mermaid retelling, but I feel there werent enough Little Mermaid references for me to appreciate it for that reason. Honestly, if I hadnt been told it was a retelling, I dont think I would have known. Did I not pick up on things that were relevant to the story? Its possible. Firstly, I expected it to be Ariels story, when it is really Ursulas which is fine, finding that out was actually kind of exciting! But then, I felt it wasnt even connected enough to Ursula. At this point, I was expecting a sort of prequel to The Little Mermaid where we follow Ursulas story of how she became evil Heartless may have influenced my expectations on villain retellings a little bit too much. In the end, the plots werent similar at all to me. Theres no mention of any characters similar to TLM other than Ursula. I wanted little bits like a mermaid with red hair or a yellow and blue fish to be thrown in here and there so it would ignite the recognition of the story, but I felt none. This is personally how I like retellings to be, so it may very well be different for you, and thats okay! Theres also the fact that Norse Mythology was implemented in the story, which again, was cool in theory! I dont know much about it, but again, the only recognition was the story of LokiThor. I could obviously be missing references based on my lack of knowledge, but it was underwhelming as well. Additionally, I heard it was Viking inspired, which I felt played into only a small portion of the story. Ultimately, I felt there were a lot of great concepts that gave me high hopes, but almost all of them fell flat in my opinion. Had there been more development on each of these or if only one main concept had been chosen, I think I would have enjoyed it more. I also was not a fan of the romance. I cannot tell you HOW DANG EXCITED I was for a Little Mermaid retelling that featured a romance between two girls. Fantasy with a fat bisexual main character and cutesy romance? SIGN ME UP. I really really enjoy the start of the romance. Ersel and Ragna meeting and the time they spent together in the first section of the book was so adorable and fluffy and it totally hooked me. Unfortunately, those feelings didnt persist. Not only is Ragna not really involved for a huge portion of the story so the romance cant exactly grow but when they are reunited, things have changed drastically, and for the worse. There is some really unnecessary violence that arose out of nowhere, and it goes virtually unchallenged. I found it to be very abusive and having this relationship displayed as a great ff romance is very unsettling to me as I believe it normalizes unhealthytoxic relationships. If you want to read more, my friend Trina does a fabulous job at addressing it in her review. I really wish my original feelings towards the romance would have continued throughout the story. It had so much potential, but I definitely do not think this is a good romance for teens and young adults to look up to. There has also been some discussion as to why the trans representation in this novel is harmful. I would definitely recommend reading this review because it explains the issues SO WELL. It completely transformed my thoughts on this particular situation and I cant recommend reading this with an open mind enough. All and all, it was an enjoyable read. I think it had so many great concepts to work with, but the execution wasnt up to par in my opinion. I wish I could recommend it as a good ff romance, but I just dont think its a healthy relationship. I can understand why a lot of people really loved it, so I may be the odd one out here, but I stand by my critiques.
Confusing at times, but beautiful nevertheless. This is one of those books that you need to read half way through in order to enjoy the other half.. And so I did  enjoyed and loved it. From the beginning there was something eerie about the action, the characters, all their secrets, the magic binding them all and the prophecies that threatened to tear them apart. Off course, it took time for the world building to sink in, for the characters to get to my heart, for the action to glue me to my chair with this book in my hand and to make me want to never let it go. You are cruel, dear Maggie, you made me love this book so much just before the ending came and took away some very close to my heart characters. How could you? How will I wait for the next book now? The pack of characters: 1. Blue is our notsoplain Jane  the girl who doesnt fit anywhere, too normal in her own home, but too weird in the eyes of the others. I liked her easy friendship with Gansey, her cute relationship with her mother and relatives, the blush on her cheeks when she talked with Adam and the stubbornness to help her raven boys. I still wonder about the prophecy about Blues first love, her first kiss, the boy that might die because of her... there are many things that still need to be revealed and I cant wait for that to happen. 2. Gansey is as we find out from the beginning either Blues true love, or he will be killed by her. Truth being told, I rooted for Gansey with his way of wanting to help everyone. Maybe helping with your money is not the right way, maybe using your power, your name is not the only way.. but he cared for his friends and it hurt when the others didnt see how much he just wanted to be there for them, to make things easier for them, to even buy their happiness if that was what it would take.. Also he had a borrowed life, one that he didnt ask for, but it gave him a purpose and it made him maybe a better version of himself. 3. Adam is my favorite raven boy. Am I allowed to have a favorite? I think I do and I cared so much for Adam, for his need to be his own property, for his hope that things could get better, for just wanting not to owe anything to anyone, for being so sincere and for making me smile with his shy love for a girl that might or might not be .. too young?. There were some things he said that made Blue blush just a bit and me giggle a bit more, because there is something sweet about a boy loving a girl and not knowing how to put into words what he feels. Knowing Adam was like holding a glass figurine  all smooth lines, but so damn easily breakable. He was a bit too proud to let people help him, but I was glad that his friendship with Roman made him make the right choice. 4. Ronan is the troubled one. Oh how I resented Ronan at the beginning, I am not even sure why. Half the book I didnt even like him, but them all changed and I am not even sure at what point. I have a gazillion questions about him, his family, his tattoo, his little bird.. But all I need to remember is how he showed Gansey how to through a punch and how he defended his friend, Adam when he most needed it, and how he cared for Noah.. and I could go on and on, but Ill just stop. 5. And then there was Noah.. Oh, poor boy, Noah, he told us his truth but we didnt have the ears to listen. I must confess that I kind of ignored him. He was there in the background and I never looked his way until I realized that he was standing right in my way. He was there, never really being, and that seems quite ironic at this point. The plot: Oh my! Yes, the first half was all about character and world building and it was slow. Its not like there was nothing interesting happening, but at the beginning everything was so confusing. There were tons of characters with different personalities and stories of their own and it was hard to focus on each one of them and remember all the details. There was so much mystery that I couldnt get my head around.. but then the light came and everything was so much easier to enjoy. After Blue joined the raven boys determined to solve the mystery and help Gansey, all pieces started to fit perfectly and that was the moment I realised how much I was enjoying this story. I loved the past and the present, the timeless wood and the magic surrounding Henrietta and our beloved characters. I loved the search for the lye lines and the sleeping king Glendower; and I loved all the secondary characters and their part in the play. I loved all the clues left behind and how everything fit into the story, I loved all the questions we had and how they havent been answered such that we will need to find out more. And I loved the tiny romantic side of the story  it didnt take my attention from what was important, but it was just enough to make me smile. 4.5 stars, so why not 5? I had one tiny problem with the writing style. I am not sure if I can explain it, but it got to be a bit confusing: You see, I usually love 3rd person narration, but the way it switched points of view in this particular story left some room for confusion  maybe you had no problems at all, but sometimes I didnt know if the narrator was thinking some things OR the characters were. depending on my mood you will probably see 4 or 5 stars here on GR Talking about GoodReads: Dont trust the synopsis from here. Whats that: Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she cant entirely explain? Did someone mistake this book for Twilight or what? Because this describes half the paranormal stories out there, but it also happens to be so very wrong when it cames to this story. If you ask me, the last time I checked Blue was drawn to someone else , and she could explain it quite very well.. Just saying. Anyways, this was indeed a great book, which I liked very much. It is full of magic and intrigue and it can only make you want to read the next one really, really badly. So keep an eye on it and read it if you get the chance  Happy midnight dreaming!

Just because you can live without someone doesnt mean you want to. This book is incredibly emotional and moving and I absolutely loved it. This book follows Lauren and Ryan, a couple who meets in college and is together for eleven years married for six. We see them at their best and we see them at their worst, and the couple is struggling to make their marriage work. They just dont care about each other the way they used to. This book reminded me a lot of one of my all time favorite movies: Blue Valentine. That movie and this book contain all of my biggest fears about marriage. The concept that someone will get bored of you, and you will eventually get sick of each other. Its something that slowly happens over months and then years and then you cant stand each other anymore and I think thats the saddest thing in the world. The one person who used to love and adore you more than anyone in the whole world cant even stand to be around you anymore. Ryan and I are two people who used to be in love. What a beautiful thing to have been. What a sad thing to be. Ryan and Lauren decide to take a year apart instead of divorcing because they feel like they need space. I cried multiple times while reading this and it was written so beautifully and so well, which is something Ive come to expect from Taylor Jenkins Reid. Lauren and Ryan are so in love in their first years together and I could honestly feel it. Their love was infectious and it jumped off the page and made me giddy. I instantly fell head over heels for Ryan, he was so charming and likable. I love Laurens relationship with her family, it all felt so real. Her sister Rachel who she is so lose to and they are so alike they often forget they arent the same person which reminds me a lot of me and my sister. And her brother Charlie, who also goes through some major character development in this book and is one of my new favorite side characters ever. Thats another thing I noticed about Taylor Jenkins Reid books: she writes amazing side characters. They always feel real and important and fleshed out and like they contribute something to the story. Like Gabby in Maybe in Another Life is one of my favorite side characters ever. Marriage is about commitment. Its about loyalty. Its not about happiness. Happiness is secondary. And ultimately, marriage is about children. When Ryan and Lauren start to have problems in their marriage, it made me so physically depressed because their problems were so real and Ive seen this happen to couples in real life all the time. They fight about everything like forgetting where he parked the car, financial problems, their sex life, where they want to go for dinner, and a lot of small everyday things that build up into something bigger. They arent honest with each other about how they feel most of the time and over a period of time they cant stand to be in the same house together. Watching them go from being insanely happy and romantic to not feeling anything at all towards each other is so depressing but also so raw and real. Thats what is so sad and scary about this book: how real it feels. Isnt it nice ... once youve outgrown the ideas of what life should be and you just enjoy what it is. This book and all these characters have a lot of different ideas about what a marriage is and what it means to be a husband or wife. Is it about happiness or stability? Or selflessness? Ive never personally been married but this book brings all those fears of marriage I have right to the surface. Marriage is a huge commitment and its all about compromise and even if you do meet the one you still might not be able to make it work. Thats fucking terrifying. It was also sad to see her family react to her and Ryan splitting up. You never realize how close he is with the family until he is gone. That was sad but cute that they both secretly read each other email drafts. When Ryan said he met someone in the email my heart broke for Lauren a little. I thought for sure towards the end that Lauren might not want to get back together with him and that made me sad, but then her and David got lost at Staples Center and she realized they were in the same scenario her and Ryan were in at Dodgers stadium last year, and she would have rather been with Ryan. I loved the side story going on of Charlie getting that girl pregnant, and hes going to move to Los Angeles and raise the baby. Charlie is a great side character, I love the way he cares about his baby and this girl Christina. Its so endearing. I fucking love the end when Laurens Grandma is dying at the same time Charlies girlfriend is giving birth and Ryan shows up at the hospital and holds her as she cries. It was so beautiful and heart breaking and it was written so well. I love at the end when she gets a response from that advice column and she prints it out and keeps it in their memory box. At least this story got a happy ending unlike Blue Valentine that just tore out my fucking heart and left it for dead lol. But damn this book was an emotional roller coaster and I actually felt so depressed. We are tied to each other. We can hate and love, miss and loathe each other all within the same breath. We can never want to see each other again while never wanting to let go. This book is so important and its so painfully beautiful and tragic and I love it. It hurts my heart but at the same time it inspires me so much. This book is written so beautifully, I highlighted so many passages I can hardly keep track of it all. I love Ryan and Lauren as characters and I loved seeing them grow together and apart. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an amazing author. This is the 3rd book Ive read from her and all of her books are so freaking great. Her books are primarily about romance, but they are always so much more than that. She dives deep into the concept of fate and marriage and soul mates and I really appreciate her books. Her characters are always so real and relatable and her writing style is gorgeous. I cant wait to read more of her books and I hope she never stops writing.
From  6 effing stars. At A Glance I. Die. You know the dreaded question: If you were stranded on a deserted island and you can only bring five books with you, which ones would you bring? Most readers would panic because the idea of only 5 books is sickening, but it seems that question is not so hard for me anymore. Because, hands down, The Sea of Tranquility would be one of those five books, and I would enjoy it again and again for years on end. Thats why I had to give it my rare 6 stars. The Good I had to wait some time to write this review after reading this book because I needed time to let the awesomeness soak in. If I hadnt, I would be a rambling mess of emotions. Even now, I dont know what to say. How can I describe the perfection of this book? Maybe its not perfect for everyone but I can guarantee that most of us readers will fall madly in love with The Sea of Tranquility. Right now this book has almost 14,000 ratings on Goodreads and is averaging a 4.56 star rating. Thats pretty damn amazing. Let me start off by saying that this is not a perfect romance. This book is more about two troubled souls, who have horrible pasts of lose, who find kinship with each other. Its a slow build and its so worth the wait. Nastya and Josh remind me of the peanut butter and jelly in a PBJ sandwich yes, thats what I had for lunch today. They couldnt be more opposite in their structure, in their overall essence, but together they meld and blend into rightness. It just takes that one time for them to come together and you know from then on they should never be separated. And then you see how similar they really are. And let me also mention that this book may seem slow in the beginning, but believe me, it needs to be that way. You cant jump into something like this without having your heart be ripped into shreds. You have to be eased in. This book packs so much emotion that I still feel raw weeks after reading it. The writing is not just words and sentences. Its art incarnate. I dont know if I have read a better written book in all my life. The dialogue is both witty and soulful. The pacing is perfect for this kind of book. The characters inner thoughts broke me, then healed me, then broke me again. I was an open wound for a couple days while reading this book, and I loved every minute of it. I think my bottom lip even quivered from time to time as I forced myself to hold back the tears. This is definitely a character driven novel. Millay goes above and beyond when making Nastya and Josh into real people. I never once thought that I was reading a book. I felt like Nastya and Josh were recounting their lives up close and personal. Even the side characters like Drew became real to me. I know these characters more than I know any family member, best friend, or even myself. I dont think anything with a beating heart could not feel bad for Nastya. She went through a heartbreaking and tragic experience that no one should have to endure. And because of this event, she has stopped speaking, to anyone. Being mute can make it hard when you go to high school, but when you dress like a Russian hooker on purpose, its apparent no amount of teasing or bullying will ever affect you. Nastya is the living, breathing version of the doorknob sigh reading Do Not Disturb. Everything she does is to keep people away. After losing a piece of her soul, she wants nothing to do with the world. But then she meets Josh. And for the first time in a long time shes interested...interested in interacting and living. Nastya is troubled and emotionally fragile but she is also a very strong person. She has to be with what shes gone through. Shes bright and talented, even if she doesnt think so anymore. But what she needs is to heal. And even Josh may not be able to do the job, because sometimes we have to heal ourselves first. Josh has lost everyone some way or another. And when everyone close to you seems to die, you kind of become a social void. The high school kids are a little afraid of Josh and he likes it that way. Hed rather be left alone. Then the mute and exotic Nastya comes into town stirring controversy and Josh cant help but notice. But its not until Nastya starts forcing herself into his daily routines that Josh starts to see the girl no one else sees. He sees someone emotionally damaged but beautiful nonetheless. Shes unique and mysterious and Josh wants to solve the mystery of her past but he lets Nastya reveal things on her own time. He gives her the space she needs and offers her security in his house and his garage where they work on his woodworking together. Josh is quiet and understanding, which is exactly what Nastya needed. The Sea of Tranquility was powerful, deep, and beautiful. It has everything a reader can hope for in a book. The plot was well thought out and executed amazingly. And the mystery behind Nastya was handled so well I still feel tense from the suspense. Ugh, I wish I was a better writer because I still dont think I even skimmed the surface of what this book is like or how it made me feel. Its indescribable. I have to mention how perfect that ending was. I was a little nervous it was going to be a sad ending but no, it wrapped up everything very well and even has the best last sentence ever in the world. My heart broke into happy little pieces then formed back together stronger than before when I read the last page. The Bad How dare anyone suggest something is bad about this book!!! : The Snuggly Mercy! Nastya and Josh have the most complicated, messed up relationship. They start out ignoring each other, then become awkward friends, then you think there can be more after a special night, then Nastya ruins it all, then Josh makes it worse. You will want to yell and scream when it comes to these two. They are both emotionally stunted and how they even became friends is beyond me. But you will also love them to the little red recesses of your heart because no two people deserve to be happy more than these two. We get a sex scene that isnt graphic. Its appropriate for YA readers. However, there is a sexual assault scene. So be prepared. Final Thoughts Remember, this is not a full blown romance type of book. The romance and relationship building takes forever, but its perfect for this book. You just have to give it time. This is a character driven book with a lot of tragic elements but has inspiring moments in it that makes it so worth all the heartbreak. VERY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Quotes People like to say love is unconditional, but its not, and even if it was unconditional, its still never free. Theres always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they wont be happy unless you are ... I just dont want that responsibility. I wished my mother was here tonight, which is stupid, because its an impossible wish. He shrugs and turns to me, drowning the smile that cracks me every time. Its not stupid to want to see her again. It wasnt so much that I wanted to see her again, he says, looking at me with the depth of more than seventeen years in his eyes. I wanted her to see you. There are so many things that can break you if theres nothing to hold you together. Were like mysteries to one another. Maybe if I can solve him and he can solve me, we can explain each other. Maybe thats what I need. Someone to explain me. People who go around advertising their birthdays are douchebags. Its a fact. You can look it up on Wikipedia.

Heres the thing, I love books. I also love music. And because of Ugly Love and Hopeless, I also came to love Colleen Hoover. So when I learned that Maybe Someday is a book involving music, written by Colleen Hoover, I just had to read it. I have read a lot of good books with music as their main theme such as Nick  Norahs Infinite Playlist, If I Stay, Just Listen, and Eleanor  Park. With that being said, I dont know what to expect with this book and I dont know how it would differ from others with the same theme. And thats when I learned that it has an original soundtrack specific for the story. That was the last straw and I just had to read it immediately. Ones birthday is supposed to be a happy event. Its supposed to be an event with all your friends and loved ones celebrating another year of your life. It should not be the day where you find out that your boyfriend is cheating on you with none other than your best friend. Unfortunately for Sydney Blake, that was exactly the highlight of her 22nd birthday. She learns about her longtime boyfriends, Hunter, infidelity with her bestfriend and roommate for 3 years, Tori. Whats worse is that she knew about it from her next door neighbor, who have known about the affair for quite a while already. This left Sydney homeless, friendless and boyfriendless all in one night. With nowhere to go, she was offered a place by Ridge Lawsonthe neighborguitarstrumming music genius who told her about the affair. But with a proposition. Ridge was in a serious writers block and his lack of a muse had been a huge struggle in composing songs for his band. So in exchange for a place to stay, Sydney was to help Ridge in writing new lyricswhich she did not know she had a talent atfor his band, Sounds of Cedar. Soon, she found herself living comfortably with a group of people she barely knew: Warrenthe funny yet sometimes annoying prankster, Bridgettethe gorgeousbutbitchyand loudsnotty girl, and Ridgethe most amazing and talented musician whom she has taken quite a liking. At first, music was what pulled Sydney and Ridge closer to each other. Sydney was the muse he was looking for and her talent in stringing words together is a gift Ridge did not expect to come by. Ridge was not only talented, he is a guitar genius. His melody latches onto Sidneys heartstrings, and as time goes, her feelings for him started to form into something she cannot control. But there is one big problemRidge is already in a relationship with Maggie. Knowing this, Sydney hated herself for even having a silent attraction towards Ridge. For after what her boyfriend and bestfriend did to her, she never wanted to be like Tori and ruin a good relationship. She wont let herself be the person she hated most. She can never fathom hurting someone else the same way she had been hurt. Her guilt will swallow her whole. As for Ridge, he will never leave Maggie and destroy what they have. Even if it means stepping on Sydneys heart. Even if its killing him to ignore his slowly growing feelings for Sydney. He will never hurt Maggie even if it meant that his friendship with Sydney had to end. It is a beautiful song but somehow out of tune. It is a melody with good harmony but somehow the words dont quite seem to fit. Its a perfect musical disaster.  Colleen Hoovers Maybe Someday tackles one of the most common reasons why relationships crumble: infidelity. Now this is not the first book to tackle cheating. There are so many books involving that topic, showing us either the cheater or the cheateesif thats even a word or the third partys perspective. But this one is a little bit different. It gives readers both insights of the cheater, the cheatee and the third party.. but with the cheatee and the third party being the same person. Confusing, right? But thats what makes this book beautiful. It is very common for a relationship to end because one person in it is incapable of faithfulness and loyalty. It shatters trusts and ignites doubt. I, for one, have been cheated on and though I have moved on, it completely changed the way I see people. And so, reading about it in this book was too painful and difficult. I cannot trust the characters and I feel a personal grudge against their actions. But then as I read on, I realize that maybe, it was really possible to fall in love with another person while still, loving the other. I guess human beings are creatures so complex that we are capable to feel love for more than just one person. I am not saying that this is an excuse to cheat because this can be avoided if things were handled carefully, honestly, and maturely. And that is what this novel brilliantly delivered. It showed the readers the struggle each personthe cheater, the cheatee, and the third partyas they come to terms with the emotions. Ms. Hoover was able to tell us the reality of things and explored the realms of relationship like never before. She was able to show us that it is not a simple rightandwrong scenario to choose who to stay with in a relationship. There are so much more to consider that just what seems to be good or for someone. I loved how this book valued communication. Ridge and Sydney both knew that their attraction is growing stronger. If this was another story, they would have just let their feelings command their actions and let it hurt other people in their lives. But in this book, they managed to talk honestly and openly about it. They tried to do what was right to prevent a cascade of bad things to happen. Their issues were so complicated and if I, myself, am is placed in that situation, I wouldnt know what to do and how to cope. But everything was made a lot easier by the fact that the characters in the story were so frank and did not attempt to lie to themselves and to each other. I also cannot express how much I enjoyed the supporting characters, particularly Warren. He was not the typical bestfriend who would support you in everything no matter what. No. He was the kind to slap some sense into Ridge when things get out of hand. Though he was not the perfect character, he was able to be supportive without being biased. Even if Ridge was his best friend, he took the time to get to know Sydney as well and understand her side. He was honest and did not hesitate to give Ridge or Sydney a piece of his mind. And the thing that I loved the most about this books is its focus on music. And not just songs, per se, but the actual process of creating music. I know that there are a lot of books out there that contain snippets of lyrics that the characters made. But even if thats also present in this book, what made it more appealing is the passion that Ridge and Sydney put into bringing about the best possible outcome. I wont tell you why I consider Ridge a musical genius and why I was blown away by his talent because it will spoil the story for you. But just know that not many people has his patience and dedication. It was really a gift. Each line, each word in their songs reflects the desires they each have buried deep inside. The accompanying soundtrack made the story even more intimate. I was playing the tracks in the soundtrack during each scene they were mentioned. And I have to say that it was a completely surreal reading experience. Hearing the actual tune and words somehow magnified the emotions of the characters. At some point, the songs brought me to tears. And I did not regret a single thing. This books is a thing of complexity and beauty. I loved how the book ended. I loved that everyone has full closure and that I was not left wondering what happened with any characters. It was certainly different from Ugly Love and Hopeless, but same in the fact that it deals with people needing time to properly heal. Though I still think that my favorite Colleen Hoover book is Ugly Love, this book is truly another great read. I will give it a 45.
This review has also been posted on Tangled in Pages Actual Rating 4.5 It took me an embarrassingly long time to finally read this book. I got it the same month it was released but I was too afraid to pick it up because what if I didnt love it? And what if I loved it so much that the wait to Cress killed me? So yes I was a coward and didnt read this magnificent book until recently and I have to say, it was SO worth it. I am probably in the minority here but I still preferred Cinder. The fact remains that I had quite a few problems with this installment, not major ones, so it only cost the book half a star but they were problems. I am going to start by mentioning the little things that I didnt like. There were too many POVs so Kai and Cinder didnt get enough page time. WHY??? Grrr. I tried not to skim some parts of Wolf and Scarlets POVs but Kai and Cinder are my favorite characters and they are my ship so yes I found myself getting annoyed by the fact that they didnt get enough page time. Hell Kais page time was almost nonexistent. At its core, this series is their story so it hurts that they didnt get enough page time. Maybe I shouldnt complain so much since Cinder did have quite a few scenes but when youre so attached to a character you cannot help but feel disappointed when they are no longer the only star. This book also had a severe case of instalove. It took Scarlet and Wolf a day. bangs head on a wall. Ill elaborate on that later. Going back to the actual book. Scarlet was a good character but, I didnt love her nearly as much as I loved Cinder. I loved Scarlets determination and how nothing could get in the way of her saving her grandmother but sometimes I think she forgot that her life was actually in danger. She was rather reckless. I do think that the author did this on purpose because Scarlet seemed to me to be a hotheaded kind of character. She was strong and feisty but she didnt always think things through. Wolf on the other hand did NOT work for me. I know most people loved him to bits and pieces but to me, he was kind of pathetic. I found him a puppy dog kind of cute but thats it. He turned his back on everything he believed because of a girl he had just met. He was weak and couldnt seem to stand up for himself. He lacked a backbone. I am sure the author intended him to be a timid character that was likable and lovable but Ive seen better examples and he didnt live up to what I had expected from him. We also met Throne. Throne is so cute. I probably would have fallen in love with him had I not been so hopelessly in love with Prince Kai. I dont know what to say about him. He is just so silly but underneath all of that he is also loyal. He can be annoying and he likes to make jokes about everything but he will always have your back no matter what. Both Cinder and Kai managed to surprise me in this book. They both grew even more and I fell in love with the two EVEN more. I hadnt thought it could be possible. Kai though, I was surprised by how he didnt spend his whole time hating on Cinder. Oh he definitely questioned whether she had been lying to him the whole time but he also realized the little things like how she had genuinely loved her sister and while he doesnt know whether she is good or bad, he didnt immediately label her as a btch and then make some bad decisions weve seen that happen before havent we?. What he did in the end broke my heart though. The romance here is obviously not between Kai  Cinder WHY??? but between Scarlet and Wolf. I dont care how you dress it, how you try to present it, it is what it is; the romance between them was based on instalove. They take a day to fall in love. While no words are said the connection is obviously there and I personally believe that their relationship was not nearly as well developed as it could have been. However, Marissa did manage to pull it off well enough because I wasnt raging because yes, me and instalove are not friends. The plot was great. It was well developed and I loved it. Some of the turns were predictable but some of them, I hadnt guessed. It kept me well engaged and once I got into the book yes I was reading it at a snail pace so I didnt speed up until the 2nd half when things started getting even more interesting I finished it in 2 hours. I have to say though, I didnt pick up on as many of the elements of the original tale as I did in Cinder. Cinder was an out of this world retelling, probably the best I had read, Scarlet on the other hand was a fabulous retelling, so while it was good, it again didnt live up to Cinder. I do remain spellbound by the world Marissa manages to create. I dont know how she does it but she took two of my favorite genres and mashed them together to create this wonderful world. Going back to the ending I mentioned earlier. WHY? WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS? WHY DOES SHE HATE US SO MUCH? My poor Kai. If anything happens to him, I will find a way inside this book and I WILL KILL Levana and then feed her to the wolves. I kid you not. Grrr. My feelings aside, I know why Kai did what he did and I respect him for it, in fact I even love him a little for it but the fact remains I am heartbroken and I want my two favorite characters to get the happy ending they deserve. Ill probably have to wait for another two books before that happens because it will or there will be hell to pay so until then Ill just curl up into a ball and cry myself to sleep.
The Oh Come All Ye Kinky anthology definitely lives up to its title. There is kinkiness galore! Peens get wrapped in snowman paper, butts get whipped with candy canes and other body parts get wrapped with Christmas lights. As you will see, some stories worked much better than others, but overall this is a pretty fun collection. Tree Topper by Jane Davitt Martin could still remember the incredulous joy hed felt the first time his hand had connected with Stans bare ass. Stan and Martin have been together for six months. Martin a dom and Stan a sub, once they met it was very natural for them to fall for each other. The problem is, their Ds relationship isnt going so well. Martin is frustrated by Stans whiny attempts at being a sub and Martin tried once to handcuff Stan but he had a panic attack and they had to stop. Now its Christmas and they are home together and getting on each others nerves. They finally talk it all out, which allows them to move forward in their BDSM relationship. I liked this one. At first Martin and Stan are both whiners and I thought they would get on my nerves, but once they discuss and get things moving in the sex department, I enjoyed it. Staying in the holiday spirit, Martin wraps Stans cock, nipples and ass in festive snowman wrapping paper. With extra tape to rip off. If that doesnt say Merry Kinky Christmas, Im not sure what will. Rating: B Twas the Night by Ava March Tell me to suck your cock. A blush rushed up Percys neck, staining his cheeks and the tips of his ears, yet Percy kept his gaze locked with Michaels. Its Christmas day and Percy has received a note from his lover Michael to meet him at his townhouse at 8pm sharp, and Percy has been looking forward to it all day. In their relationship, Michael is definitely the one in control. Percy feels a bit lost, craving the structure and control Michael provides him, but wondering if the things he craves is not proper. Michael decides for this Christmas night to let Percy speak up and voice what he wants. It takes some prodding, but soon Percy starts to have the confidence to ask for what he wants and feel at peace with his desires. I adore Ava Marchs voice and I thought this is a really well done short story. It takes place during one night, but I still feel like I really got to know Michael and Percy. Michael builds up Percys confidence and Percy learns that what he wants is truly okay. Ava March can write such warm, emotional love scenes. While Michael is the dominant, there are still some tender moments between them. Super sexy too. Rating: B Fireworks by Katie Porter Ive read FF in the past and have found some that Ive enjoyed. This one however, was way too over the top for me. Rachel is this very dominant, kind of crazy insane woman and she is moving away soon. This story is a night with them together right before she moves away. At one point Rachel throws glitter all over Emma and says Jesus, you look like a slut. Some fuckable pole dancer. Thats romantic. rolls eyes She made Emma stick her tongue out more than once so she could bite it. Not for me. Rating: DNF Candy Caning by LA Witt Stephen and Nate have spent 4 years together and for four years, every Christmas at Nates mothers house, who ends up treating them bad. But she is family, so they suck it up and go. Nate drags Stephen to the mall to get gifts for his family, something Stephen dreads but since he loves Nate tags along. At the mall, Stephen finds something joyous. a 3 foot long, thick candy cane. Perfect for bedroom play and Nate couldnt agree more. The whimper escapes before I can stop it. I clap my hand over my mouth, but the damage is done. His devilish look almost knocks my knees out from under me. He knows. Of course he does. Hes doing this on purpose. And he probably knows damn well that the effect is extra pronounced by the display of pristine white angels forming an ironic halo around and above his head. I thought youd like that idea. He winks and then hooks the cane back on its rack, no doubt well aware of the pang of disappointment in my chest. I literally bite my tongue to keep from begging him to change his mind. Thats not allowed, and the punishment for it would be not finding out what kind of marks a threefoot, cockthick candy cane could leave across my ass. I loved this story! Stephen is such a sexy, sexy Dom and Nate is just adorable with a great inner monologue. They are adorable and lovely together. I could have read an entire book about them. Very well done. Rating: B Submissive Angel by Joey W Hill This story seemed...softer than the rest of the collection. This story takes place six months after Robert meets Ange in an alley behind his toy shop beat up badly. Ange says things to Robert like, Since the North Pole layoffs, things have been rough. You get a sense, he might be otherworldly. Ange dances around, and while he is the submissive really becomes the rock Robert needs. Roberts previous sub wasnt there for him when times got tough. This is a very sweet story, not so much in your face as the other entries. It felt a little unfinished for me. Rating: C Open Return by Elyan Smith Zach left the Midwest for Australia 15 years ago, a confused person. He was in a relationship of sorts with a married couple, but it all became too much. Zach is transgendered, and used to be called Hannah, but now lives as a man named Zach and has come to peace with everything. He knocks on the door of the married couple and they end up restarting their relationship. A lot of heavier issues are brought up in this one and I think it would have worked better had we more time to explore everything. Too many emotions are shoved into a short story. It was hard for me to become engaged. Rating : C Ring Out the Old and In the New by Alexa Snow Evan got mugged on a train, leaving a nasty scar on his face. He is terrified to leave his house, although he is encouraged by his partner and Dom to try to get over his trauma. Its a very straight forward glimpse into the lives of these two guys. Russell uses his Dom rules to help Evan first find a safe place with him and then move forward with the rest of his life. A simple yet sweet story. Rating: C His Very Last Chance by Kim Dare Drew hasnt been the best at following instructions and now wants to right his wrongs with his Dom Kingsley. Kingsley wants to experiment with different things and show Drew just what skills he has, and teach him a lesson. Kingsley personally explores romance versus love. I dont know if I came to know these two all that well, but I enjoyed the scene we get with them together. This one takes place on New Years Eve, a nice way to end the anthology. Rating: B Overall Id probably give this anthology a C. A variety of characters all among a strong BDSM theme. I hope they do this again next year.
Immediate Reaction: You guys. this book resonated with me so much!! It was so amazing and I just LOVED. The friendships!!! I could talk forever about it. Originally posted on my blog: www.bookscents.com Since Youve Been Gone was the first book Ive read by Morgan Matson and it definitely wont be my last! In fact, I really need to go devour her other books now because I LOVED Since Youve Been Gone! It was so relatable and I couldnt stop thinking about it after I finished! Oh, and did I mention I finished it at like 4:30 a.m? Yes. I couldnt put it down! Im usually more of a fantasy gal, so it did surprise me just how much I adored this one! Now, brace yourselves. This review may be lengthy. I have so much to say and so much love to heap on this book and Morgan!! Sloane, Emilys best friend, has apparently disappeared without a word, leaving nothing but a list of items she wants Emily to complete. Some are easy, some are hard, and some just seem impossible! But Emily believes that somehow, by completing them, she can find her best friend again. Initially, this one sounded good but it didnt seem that exciting, you know? I was so wrong. It is FULL of amazing, you guys. FRIENDSHIPS!! This book spoke so much about friendships and its intangibles! Morgan manages to capture all these moments and intricacies of what friendships and being a friend meansis that was just so spot on and true and RELATABLE. Firstly, I feel like Emily was ME. At the beginning of high school, I was so super shy. Seriously all her awkwardness in the beginning? Completely, totally me back in the day. Im pretty much the complete opposite now, haha But I completely related and understood Emily. Anyway, as she tries to work through the list, she ends up making some new friends and matures and makes huge giant leaps of coming into her own and finding herself. At first it really seems that Emily is very dependent on Sloane and I loved seeing her figure out herself independent of Sloane. Morgan captures the feeling of a best friend so accurately though. That feeling of knowing you can call them anytime, tell them anything and everything  it can be stupid, frivolous, serious  and tell it all without being judged, but just listened to and accepted. That need to share everything, even if not necessarily important but its something that happened and immediately, you need to tell them the story. That feeling of having someone be so close to you that you can communicate with a look and the comfort of knowing that theyre there for you. ALL of that Morgan manages to pen into this story. She manages to put you there and make you feel things! Sure its a story about teens but the fundamentals about friendship are the same and I feel like we all want and need these close friendships. This isnt just shown in Emily and Sloanes friendship though. While trying to complete the list, Emily makes friends with Dawn, Collins and Frank who are all secondary characters that I loved. The nuances of friendships definitely shines through in those relationships as well. Speaking of.... The Unexpected Swoon: FRANK PORTER Frank Porter is the good guy. He is the class president. He heads up causes and projects and he is the last person Emily thought she would become friends with. Also, the last person to have sneaky amazing abs. He is nice, brilliant, funny, spontaneous and oh god  if I become a cougar, I blame Morgan Matson. Anyway, Frank decides to help her with this list and they have the most fantastically, perfectly paced building friendship of all time. It is pretty much the best thing ever, just trust me on that. Music! Morgan includes the playlists Emily and Frank listen to as they go on runs together and I love it. Once again I related to Emily because umm, I freaking love country and all her country song choices just made me smile. Anyway, love having the playlist aspect, just kind of puts you in that moment I think. For some reason, I think of the song Barefoot Blue Jean Night by Jake Owen when I think back on this book. It kind of has that carefree aspect in it. Anyway, I love how much this book resonated with my soul. I loved watching as Emily worked through the list and opens up and finds her own identity. The portrayal of friendships is so accurate and probably the best book featuring friendships that Ive read. This one may have affected me more since I recently just moved and left a lot of close friends. I definitely identified with Emily on a smaller scale since obviously I can still talk to them of thinking someone is around and then remembering oh, I cant just go over and see them. I MISS that best friend feeling, of having a partner in crime to talk to, do crazy things with... dance until dawn! : Final Thoughts: If you havent read this yet, dont put it off any longer! Its a perfect summer read and has the most amazing friendship aspect. It will take you back to your first best friend, make you think of the friends you have now, make you miss the ones far away and leave you wanting to make a list for your own faraway friends. : Like I said, it resonated with my soul. I adored it! In a well ordered universe... everyone would read this book! ; Favorite Quote: She had reacted just as Id hoped she would throughout. Shed been responding at the right moments, making me realize how much Id missed telling her things  her enthusiasm, her complete lack of judgment, the way that, even when you were wrong, she was on your side.
This review can also be found on A Thousand Lives Lived, check it out for more reviews! A most anticipated Christmas gift, a light onto my heart, a book that will stay memorable forever, My True Love Gave to Me truly satisfied me and my likings. Stephanie Perkins as an editor was probably the best thing ever, and this gorgeous holidayedition included stories from all of my favourite authors, from beginning to end, and I discovered some new ones, as well. I need you to be my person, Mags said. I need to see you. And hear you. I need you to stay alive. And I need you to stop kissing other people just because theyre standing next to you when the ball drops. Peace, hope and holiness. I ended up having a ton of favourite stories, and a few ones that I rather wouldve skipped, but altogether I know that I will be picking this up over again and again every Christmas, especially for the warming of my heart and the feelings that I got with every couple in the story. I just cant get enough! Midnights by Rainbow Rowell 5 stars: AGH. After reading this one, I had the highest hopes for this bookespecially since it also began with my favourite authors story. You see, Rainbow can just create and captivate you in a short storys time from the first page. Her characters were sweet as candy canes, to be honest. Mags and Noel? Favourite couple ever. And its so adorable but probably true for many people on how they fell in love at first sightalthough they didnt realize it at first. New Years Eve? Thats the most romantic getaway, ever, period. We started off with them as young bugs, but through every page and every year as they got together, they finally realized the chemistry they once had, and always will have. That kiss just was the fireworks for me, and this story was the main highlight of the book. The Lady and the Fox by Kelly Link 5 stars: BAM, the sequel story was gorgeous as well. I never have heard of Kelly or her books before, and I was kind of doing the gnawingonmylip thing as I was about to begin this oneexpecting the worse. I guess you can say that Im not much of a risktaker, eh? Truth to be told, I was extremely proud of what this turned out to be. Of course, Link created a quirky and strange way of telling a love story, but it was cute in its own way. Thats another way that things captivate me. After the catastrophically gorgeous ending, I sat there and prayed for more gratefulness from this author in my eyes. My my, can I just say that Daniel and Miranda were adorable? At the same time, their story had such a deep, beautiful meaning and the title of the story definitely made sense all in the end. I laughed, I teared up, in just a matter of moments. Angels in the Snow by Matt de la Pena 5 stars: And this... This was the last of them. The last of the 5 stars, haha. Its funny since this was the third straightinarow book in this 5star sequence. It was so sweet and simple, but it warmed my heart at the same time. The protagonist was depressed, but love saved him. I SCREAMED AND LAUGHED AND PANICKED BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT TO FINISH IT. But then the ending came, and I was happy. Angels in the Snow really was like reading about gorgeous holy angels... These characters. Polaris is Where Youll Find Me by Jenny Han 2 stars: Jenny Han is one of my favourite authors, and I actually know tons of people who adore her work, even my friends who dont actually read so often. Ive read all of her books, and this short story actually needed a lot of work, in my opinion. I was lurking for something bittersweet, but what I ended up getting was a story too focused on the Christmas aspect, rather than the gorgeousness of romance and love. I am in love with all chicklits with a little more bitterness, but this was something that I felt lost and bored from. Was that a good thing? Absolutely not. Its a Yuletide Miracle, Charlie Brown by Stephanie Perkins 4 stars: STEPHANIE PERKINS IS BAE, OKAY? Like honestly, Isla killed me in August, and from then on, Ive been waiting and crying and pleading for more from her. This wasnt her best work and certainly not the best story from this book, but I really enjoyed it. feels the feels I chucked, blushed and wanted something fulllength. I better get that in the future! Your Temporary Santa by David Levithan 4.5 stars: UMMM I LOVE DAVID, PERIOD? To be honest, I didnt expect something amazingbut this was. It was hilarious and definitely diverse and unique, as Levithan always hands to us. Theres really never a piece of his work that disappoints me! Krampuslauf by Holly Black 3 stars: Um, what was this? I got confused and I felt like I didnt want or need a fantasy novel in this. I understand that its what Black usually goes with in her writing, but I didnt fall for it. This is supposed to be about Christmas and the romance, not some spells and acornstuff. This wasnt my sort of thing, really. What the Hell Have You Done, Sophie Roth? by Gayle Forman 2.5 stars: Another disappointment from an author I love. This was probably the story that I was anticipating the most for, and especially for the best, but I was left confused. Please. All I wanted was a good read that would make me think about the stars and dream of hot cocoa and peppermint sticks. Beer Buckets and Baby Jesus by Myra McEntire 4 stars: Hah. This was probably the most quirky, absurd but different read from this whole selection. Ive heard so much praise on McEntires books, and Im so captivated to get more from her! Welcome to Christmas, CA by Kiersten White 3 stars: Meh. This didnt turn out as amazing as it did to others... Sure, food was a major and crazy aspect and all, but Whites work isnt that fantastic as I heard it was... I hope that Mind Games will be great, though. Star of Bethlehem by Ally Carter 3 stars: You see, this one wasnt memorable at all. Its been two weeks since I completed reading this book, and I dont even remember what this was even about. So I had to scan over it. This was bland, and as I once fell out of love with Carters work, I can say that Im totally not back into it again. This couldve been cute, but it needed some more magic into it. The Girl Who Woke the Dreamer by Laini Taylor 3.5 stars: This was GOOD. I mean, the magic worked in this situation, and Taylors work is incredibly deep and Im so ready for DAUGHTER OF SMOKE AND BONE. YESS. Together, this really was a blast of sunshine. You know, I love those books where you feel like your indulging on something gorgeous and yummy that melts in your mouth, like a cupcake. This was a read that got me obsessed and I couldnt have enough. I love the idea that most had of reading a story a day, but I wouldnt be able to do that. You will be obsessed.
There is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes do bad things. It Ends With Us is a devastating, evocative story of forgiveness, empathy, understanding, and impossible choices. I had to set this book down and step away from it more than once, I had to take moments to cry and feel and breathe. I had a visceral reaction to every page, a physical ache to forgive the unforgivable, emotional distress over witnessing such devastation, grief over all that is lost. Friendships are born and broken in these pages, lives are saved and destroyed, lessons are learned, souls are crushed, hope is restored and dashed, the people you least expect to hurt you do, the people you least expect to save you will. I felt the raw intensity of falling in love, of falling apart, every note of humor and joy and despair so acutely. I felt this book in a way I know I will never forget. Maybe love isnt something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flows, in and out, just like the people in our lives. Ryle Kincaid, Lilys present day love interest and successful neurosurgeon, is arrogant and sexy and driven and I fell for him instantly. Atlas Corrigan, the kind, affectionate teenager from her past, is beautifully broken and I loved him immediately and intensely. It was difficult to fathom a future for 24 year old florist, Lily Bloom, that didnt include both of these men who were so dear to her at varying points in her life, and my heart hurt knowing we couldnt have them both. Colleen Hoover vividly and humorously juxtaposes the past with the present, threading the heaviness of Lilys youth with the lightness and humor of her diaries to make for an emotional storyline peppered with both devastation and wit. When the two parts of her life converge, the boy from her past who had nothing and the man from her present who has it all, Lily must decide what it all means for her future. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear. Going in, I believed this was merely a romance about a woman whod have to make a choice between the two men shed loved after their paths unexpectedly collided, but I soon realized that It Ends With Us is so much more than I could have ever predicted. This story shattered me. I loved every character thoroughly, connected with them in different but equal ways, and thats why the events in this book are so inconceivable. There was no predicting the course of events that would occur within these pages. Things happened in this story that I never saw coming, couldnt believe were actually happening and everything I thought I knew, thought I believed in, became uncertain. To experience Lilys journey properly, the reader has to first be made to love these characters the way she does, then be blindsided by their unthinkable behavior as she is, and then experience the heartbreaking decisions shes forced to make right along with her... and Hoover deliberately and exquisitely ensures we do just that . I think about Ryle. I think about Atlas. I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide. Ill tell you now that this story is not what you think it is. Its different. Its bigger. Its more. Its romantic, no doubt about that. The undeniable chemistry between Lily and Ryle wars with the passionate history between Lily and Atlas to make for an emotional, tumultuous journey of love and heartbreak. But this story is something else entirely. Its a story of familial drama, of friendship, of healing and rebuilding and finding peace with things that cant be changed. Its about experiencing the best and the worst in people and deciding whats worth the risk. Its a love story... two actually... but to simply call this book a romance significantly dims the brilliance that is It Ends With Us. Colleen Hoover fans like myself will find everything they love about this author within these pages. But readers should set their expectations and preconceived notions aside because, while this story is signature CoHo, it far exceeds anything weve ever seen from her before. Hoover steps outside the box in the very best ways with It Ends With Us, but this isnt just her toeing the line. This is Colleen Hoover making a new box, a bigger box, an extensive, impressive, more polished box. Colleen Hoover just took the old box, the one with Slammed and Maybe Someday and November 9 and Hopeless in it, blew the lid off it, dumped it all inside a huge new box, so all our favorite signature COHO stuff is still in there the humor, the smart dialogue, the enigmatic characters, the captivating storyline, the heavy themes, the raw emotions. But now its a much larger box with a whole lot more stuff in it. New stuff. Beautiful stuff. Powerful stuff. Stuff weve never seen. Things we didnt expect. This new box is glorious and ugly and fantastic. Its a box of CoHo taking chances. Its a box of CoHo getting unbelievably personal while broadening horizons all at once. It Ends With Us is an exciting, fresh box filled with the old classic CoHo and a bunch of other awesome and beautiful things that cant even be named. This new box just blew my mind. In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me. This is, hands down, the best book Colleen Hoover has ever written. Is it my favorite? I dont know how to answer that. It feels wrong to describe the course of events in this book as my favorite anything. It feels wrong to call a book I wish had never been written phenomenal. But Ill call it that because thats what it is. Its the most powerful, beautiful, haunting story this author has ever delivered. Its also one of the most profoundly important books Ive ever read. I was deeply effected by this story. I felt everything this author set out to make her reader feel while reading this book. The love, the hope, the devastation, the grief, the fear, the sadness, the loss, the conflicting emotions, all of it. I got it. I was so far in this story, in these characters, on this journey, I dont know how long itll take me to find my way out. This is not a feel good story. This isnt heartwarming. This is tragic. And its perfect. Every single detail, every brick in the wall of the structure of this story, was meticulously placed by this author and it was done so magnificently. I dont know if its my favorite because this story made me feel things I dont ever want to feel again, but the fact that she made me feel THAT WAY means this story was executed perfectly, that it is, under no uncertain terms, phenomenal.
Before reading this book I didnt know anything about suicide partners, Id never even heard of them. You probably think it strange but my first thought was: well at least they dont have to die alone. One of my greatest fears is being alone, and I found it comforting that, even people who had reached such a low point in their lives in which they saw no other option then taking their own lives, didnt want to be alone at the end. Be careful, he says. Why? Im not thinking about being careful. Im thinking about one last push, of letting go, of flying, and of falling. You arent allowed to die without me, he whispers. Jasmine Warga deals with a very serious topic that sadly is very relevant in our world today. Although I have read books that contain suicide before, I have never read one of the topic of suicide partners and I was intrigued as to how it was going to be handled. Its intense and its heavy, but it is also hopeful. Jasmines gut wrenching honesty gives us a haunting portrayal of depression at its darkest and really shows her talents as she turns something as somber and sensitive as suicide into something stunning. Aysel and Roman both chose to have a suicide partner because they need someone to make sure their suicide happens. Roman needs a car and an excuse to get away from his over protective mother, Aysel needs someone to make sure she goes through with it. They are not after friendship, or someone to try and talk them out of it. All they want is someone who understands that they want to do this and to make sure it happens right. FrozenRobots eyes are soft and patient. He knows what hell find if he digs deeper. Theres no rush to unpack my insides. He understands there is nothing special about emptiness, nothing interesting about depression. I gather the courage to look at him. He gives me a slight smile and Im pretty sure Ive found my suicide partner. But with that understanding of the need to die comes something else, the ability to be the only person to understand exactly what the other is going through: their black holes and giant slugs of depression. They know the right things to say, the right things to do, and from that grows a friendship and a partner who they come to rely on for much more then to stand beside them and jump when the time is right. Both Aysel and Roman are severely depressed and have been contemplating their deaths for quite a while, so for them it is a very normal thing to think and talk about. It was quite scary at times how casual a topic they found it, checking on suicide forums to see who had died that week, making plans to go and find a suitable place to die, or meeting up to write suicide letters. Their casual approach to the whole thing made it quite hard at times having to read about these two young people that I had come to like who were just so ready to die. According to the boards, Suicide Partners ElmoRains and TBaker14155 took the plunge. I dont know how SovietSummer231 obtained this information, but hopefully FrozenRobot and I will have the same kind of success. One thing that stands out with both of our characters is the strength of their hearts and their desire to rid the world of their lives in order to save the people around them. Aysel fears becoming her father and unleashing an ugly part of herself on the world, whilst Roman struggles with his guilt of being a constant reminder to his family of the bad things they have been through. Neither of them want to cause any more pain then is necessary, they are not bad people, and reading about the way that they see themselves is incredibly emotional and required a number of emotional recovery breaks whilst reading. Im doing my best to hide it all from her. Once Im gone, I dont want her to feel guilty thinking there was something she could have done. As the book is written from Aysels POV it is her we get to know the most and even though a lot of her thoughts at the beginning of the book were very dark I found myself immediately liking her. She was broken and struggling, but underneath it all there were these moments when we got to see the real Aysel shine through, and she was brilliant. She was funny, and full of personality and passion, especially for physics. Jasmine expertly weaves Aysels love of physics and the way that she understands the world into a head and heart filled with such dark thoughts and feelings to produce a very unique and beautiful perspective of the world. I once read in my physics book that the universe begs to be observed, that energy travels and transfers when people pay attention. Maybe thats what love really boils down to  having someone who cares enough to pay attention so that youve encouraged to travel and transfer, to make your potential energy spark into kinetic energy. Maybe all anyone ever needs is for someone to need them, to observe them. Most noticible about Aysel and Roman is their desire to not connect with anything that might stop them from going through with their plan. Aysel tries to distance herself from everything: people at school, her own family and Romans family, but through the book she keeps finding herself being forced into these situations that show her just how much she actually has in her life worth living for. Moments of dread for her become moments of hope for us. I stare at Mrs. Franklin, her smiling, eager to please face, and I know that Roman and I are about to break her heart. Most important of all is Aysel and Romans connection to each other which grows deeper throughout the book, and provides us with the constant hope that these two people can save each other and find a life worth living together. It is a hope that keeps us hooked, right to the very end. I cant make you happy. We cant let each other make each other happy. I pause, decoding his sloppy slurred sentence. In lean in toward him. Would that be so bad? He snaps his eyes open. Theyre bright and glossy, and at the same time, light and watery. That would ruin everything. You can find more of my reviews at Brocs Bookcase
4.5 stars Yelena, Im offering you a choice. You can either be executed, or you can be Commander Ambroses new food taster. His last taster died recently, and we need to fill the position. I gaped at him, my heart dancing. He had to be joking. He was probably amusing himself. Great way to get a laugh. Watch hope and joy shine on the prisoners face, then smash it by sending the accused to the noose. I played along. A fool would refuse the job. My voice rasped louder this time. And so I was hooked! Poison Study by Maria V. Snyder was a phenomenal read. It follows the story of a 19 year old this isnt mentioned in the book so I am just clarifying what her age is; I know this from this one interview that Ive read with Maria V. Snyder woman named Yelena. After admitting to murder, she is to be executed. FortunatelyUnfortunately, the mysterious Valek offers her a job as the Commanders food taster. Soon many plots begin to develop, but each road leads to Yelena. Will she survive? Again. HOOKED! What shall I tell the executioner? Valek asked. I am not a fool. I looooved this book. It was heart chilling and empowering at the same time. The romance though foreseeable was amazingly written. Honestly, I didnt pay attention to if the writing was good or not, I just read for the plot this time. Overall, great book. I would recommend this to people who want to start reading New AdultAdult books. This is classified YA, but it is on the verge. I personally think it should be a New Adult novel, but it is marketed as YA. Also, fans of The Hunger Games, Graceling, and the first two Throne of Glass books should pick this up. This book is a cross between the four. In the book, a thing that was hard for me to get through was the first hundred pages. They are filled with world building. This is very good that an author builds her world so well, making sure that we understand everything that happens and why, while still leaving a little bit of a mystery. BUT IT WAS SOOO DARN SLOWWWW. Other than that i didnt find anything that wasnt to my liking criticallywise. Some of the times I read the book and got really easily distracted as if the book wasnt really for me. As I have said before I read this book for pleasure not critical analysis like I do a lot these days. There were just a few moments like this, so my overall rating just dropped to 4.5 stars. These were minor things and things that were specific to me, and you can have a totally different opinion. There was some potentially offensive content. This doesnt bother me, this is just a heads up for future readers of this book. The main character was abused prior to the beginning of the book. She recalls these moments in full detail. Yelena also remembers throughout the novel how she was raped by her former masters and sexually assaulted somewhere near the middle of the book. The scenes never get too graphic as this is YA, but I wouldnt advise anyone below the age of 12 to read this. Again, I dont really believe in age books, so if you are an 11 year old who has read The Catcher in the Rye or Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman then go ahead. Again this is just a heads up and didnt affect my rating. Everything negative said, I LOVED THIS BOOK! Even though I usually saw the twists coming, I still really enjoyed this novel. I shipped Valek and Yelena since chapter one when they have the discussion about the job and she challenges him by saying a fool would refuse the job. Then he challenges her by saying that the food testers die, and she retorts that she isnt a fool: LOVE! Or yes I did see that Mogkan was the evil guy and worked with Brazell. Aaaand that Rand worked for Captain Star. These were pretty obvious, but I still loved this novel nonetheless. I fell in love with Yelena and Valeks relationship. The characters were so well developed, and even though they lived in a futuristicmagical setting, they were totally relatable. I really enjoyed the talk about fighting your demons. It is a very important matter to the world now, in my opinion. People fall into depression because of the horrors of their pasts. And yet they still must live. Sometimes the experiences are so unbearable that they commit suicide. This book, intentionally or not, raises awareness to this and I think that his is a very important factor of the story. Another thing that I think was an important factor to this story was the many different plot lines. Maria V. Snyder is amazing at keeping everything in line. It was interesting to see magic, drug addiction Criollo, and politics combine in one big plot line in the end. Ill start with the deadliest one, he said. If you dont die from it, the other poisons wouldnt kill you either. I dont want to waste all my time training you only to see you die in the end. He placed a slender red bottle on his desk. Its nasty. Affects the body immediately. Valeks eyes lit up as he admired the poison. Its called Have a Drink, My Love, or My Love for short because the poison has a history of being used by disheartened wives. I havent marathoned a series in a while now... This is going to change as Magic Study is the next book on my TBR. To sum up, Poison Study is a deadly poison that captures you and doesnt let you go until you turn that last page.
Present Perfect by Alison G Bailey 5 my tear ducts are empty emotional stars!! Ive been unsure about many things in my life except that I have always loved him. Every single minute of every single day that I have been on this earth, my heart has belonged to him. It has never been a question, never a doubt. The love had taken on many different forms over the years, but it had always been a constant. OMG...this has got to be one of the most emotional books I have ever read!! I was crying when I didnt even know why I was crying, it was that emotional. I have never cried so much over a book. I think that this had a profound effect on me because I could relate to some of the subject matter, so I could see a lot of myself on the page and that kind of made it personal. Amanda was born on 230390 at 10.57pm, Noah was born 230390 at 10.58pm, other than the 1 minute that separated their births, they had always been together. They had shared all their firsts, first teeth, smile and words. They crawled at the same time and took their first steps together. They were always together. They grew up as best friends, they were soul mates, they were inextricably linked to each other and their bond was fierce. No one could come between them. Amanda or Tweet as Noah lovingly referred to her was a second child, she had an older sister who was perfect, she was constantly being compared to her and in her eyes she failed miserably. How could you compete with perfect looking, perfect grades, perfect at sport, perfect at dancing, just perfect at EVERYTHING!! This was not some feel sorry for me phase, her parents constantly compared the two and whether they meant to or not that always made Amanda feel inferior. In fact, this was so ingrained into her growing up that she was terribly insecure. She had no selfconfidence whatsoever. Noah was AMAZING, I just love him soooooooo much, every girl should have a Noah. He loved Amanda no matter what, she was his Tweet. He was always there for her, always looking out for her, they had their spot where they would put the worlds to rights and they told each other everything. They were as close as two BFFs together could ever be. It was a beautiful friendship. This story takes us on the journey of how Amanda and Noahs friendship develops, their journey through life, to their teenage years. This is when the lines become a bit blurred, hormones come into being and suddenly both of them are seeing each other in different light. Suddenly, bums and boobs are noticed, abs and cute bums and Amanda has a hard time coming to terms with her newfeelings for Noah. Noah on the other hand has no problem what so ever of embracing his new found love for Tweet. He tells her enough, but in Tweets eyes, she is not good enough for him, he deserves better. Noah is gorgeous, he is popular, the girls love him, they all wanted him, but he never acted upon their advances, he was saving himself for Tweet. He tried and tried to get her to see that their relationship was worth a try, but Tweet valued their friendship too much and did not want to put that in jeopardy should anything in their relationship go wrong, so she pushed and pushed and pushed until he finally relented and started dating. This however did not go down well with Tweet, while she didnt want him, she didnt want anyone else to have him either and the green eyed monster was constantly apparent. This actually managed to cause friction in their friendship and this is where the cracks started to appear and this is where I started crying the most! Tweet. His voice was low and raspy. Yeah? I said trying to keep my voice steady. Tonight was amaz..., he paused. Youre amazing. Noah... I trailed off as I choked back a sob. I wish you believed it, he said. He left without saying another word. Standing alone, watching him walk away, the only thought running through my mind was, I wished I believed it too, so I could be your girlfriend. Noah knows what Tweet is doing and he only ever has casual dates for quite a while, he still tries to chip away at Tweets resolve in the hope that he can break through her walls of doom and gloom and get her to see that they are so compatible. It is like they were destined to be together forever. I must admit, Tweet did begin to annoy me, I was getting very angry with her at one point. I just felt like screaming at the kindle saying open your god damn eyes and smell the coffee, he loves you, he is devoted to you, did you not see the stars, moons and plants align when you two were born FGS!!! It is obvious to everyone and I mean everyone that they should be together but Tweet just does not get it AT ALL!! She loves him with all her being, but she just cannot get over the potential of losing him, so rather than take the chance she would rather go without. I cant be around you right now. It hurts too much, because I am so completely and desperately in love with you Tweet.... There hasnt been a day in my life that I havent loved you. I wish you would just let me love you.... You will always be the most important thing in my life. Ill always be there for you no matter what or who. I have no past without you and I cant imagine a future that doesnt include you. I just need some time to figure out how I can have you in my life without having you be my life. There my heart breaks, yes I watched it splinter and shatter into smithereens and the waterworks from them on were on constant!! He put his heart and soul out there!! They always shared their firsts and there was one first they didnt and this severely crippled me, I would have thought that somehow this could have been written in, but alas no!! What happened with Tweet broke my heart and I dont think I ever truly recovered after that. They do go their separate ways as they go to college, not speaking, this breaks them both and it shattered any tiny bit of resolve I had left...I just continued to cry...and cry...and cry...things happen, life goes on....miserably...and I cry, yes I am still crying...did I say I was still crying....yep still crying you get the gist. Then Alison Bailey throws the curve ball, whoa!! I did not see that coming....I cannot say anymore...I am too emotional, too heart broken, too devastated, too emotionally spent, just too OMG OMG OMG. This story was truly amazing, I felt everything, I could not put it down, I read it in one sitting, I inhaled it, I must be a sadist because it killed me, but it was one of those books that even though it was emotionally exhausting, you had to see it through to the end. Nothing I could write could possibly describe the number that this book did to me. It will forever be imprinted in my memory and in my heart. I totally adored this book!! There are some amazing side characters in this book and am hoping that their stories are told so that I can continue to read about this couple. I cant believe that this is a debut book and all hats off to Alison Bailey, she did a fantastic job, the book is just WOW!! I highlighted almost all this book, so I will leave you with another quote: I wasted so much time and hurt you. Nothing has ever been a waste when it comes to you. Not my time, my thoughts, or my heart. I dont regret anything about my life with you, even the times we were apart. Those times showed me how much I belonged to you. I knew we would be together one day. I just had to be patient and wait. And you were so worth waiting for. I totally freaking loved this book, go forth and 1click, pick up a box of tissues and a big fat carton of ice cream and read. Ill be here waiting for the counselling sessions to start...I have big shoulders, we can have a mutual sob fest!! Totally and utterly amazeballs!! www.theromancecover.com
 REVIEW IS UP ON MY BLOG AS WELL! Colleen Hoover is probably one of my favorite authors to ever live! I have been reading her books for years! And not to brag or anything but like most people in the literary world I have read each and every one of her brilliant books! Reading Colleen Hoovers books is addicting. I think she herself might even be addicting! I started this book late one night in the week, but due to a busy schedule with school, I put off reading it. So one night I just decided to read one page that always makes me want more and this was no different but I was too tired to continue on. A few nights later we were in full swing! I really hoped I couldve read this book in one night but I just couldnt. The first thing I want to say is I started reading this book and then did something completely stupid! I used to read the end of the book before the beginning but I dont do that anymore. Now with this book I never read the synopsis, nothing, I mean its Colleen Hoover, you dont need those things with her, shes just truly amazing! So about a quarter way through the book I got curious and went to read the synopsis, about twenty minutes later I was so super curious and of course had to go and read the end! And well I still adored Ryle at that point, but I read the Authors Note and started making conclusions! I mean how stupid could I have been! Well, I will say this, though, the writeup and the Authors Note intrigued me so much that, that was the night I stayed up until 3AM to finish reading It Ends With Us. But anyway you guys dont want to read about my stupid crazy rant about my process of reading! You want to know about the book! Well, it was surprising... It Ends With Us was the first Colleen Hoover book that I felt was very Harlequin romance in the beginning! Like a billionaire romance novel with a twist! Being a teenager I absolutely loved that! I felt the feeling of the billionaire and the heroine, and I just loved that! The minute I read about Ryle I was grinning and honestly I loved him! Of course, everything I thought I knew I didnt. I really thought this was just going to be amazing and very adult! I thought there wasnt going to be anything sad about this book! Maybe just a challenge from Lily. Damn was I wrong! This book had me thinking about it for a long time after I read it! I was shocked and loved it so much! This is 100 a fivestar review for me! This is Colleen Hoovers best book yet! I didnt love November Nine as much as I loved Colleen Hoovers other books but It Ends With Us made up for all of that! I mean I was moved! I loved the atmosphere of this book. Like the surroundings. The building Allysa and eventually Lily lived in sounded so amazing! The City, the whole atmosphere of the book was amazing! Oh and Marshall! God how I loved Marshall! He was the sweetest, funist, funniest character ever! Somehow I imagine him to be British... Even though he isnt. Lol. All the time jumps in this book was perfect! It made It Ends With Us even more real and not rushed at all! It was done at a very nice pace. They were everywhere they were supposed to be. The time jumps also helped not drag out the book. Now I want to talk about the characters! I dont want to say much about the storyline because I will just give it all away. Lily was the best character ever! I loved her thinking, her creativity! I mean her flower shop sounds amazing! Where can I find a flower shop just like that? Lily was strong and real! She was compassionate and she loved Ellen! I mean how cool is that! Lily was very smart as well; I mean she never did anything stupid! Her choices were so bold and big! She loved intensely I could tell that her love was infinite and her love for little Emerson was just so special! I know we only got to see that part very little but her love for Emerson shined! Ryle, Im sorry to say this... But he was, unfortunately, my favorite character. In my last blog post, I mentioned that I sometimes loved the villains... And in this case, I loved the villain! I actually wanted him to change! I know the book wouldnt be the same if he did, but I loved his character so much from the first few chapters. But everything he did was repulsive... I do think he is going to be a good daddy to Emerson though. If Im honest I when I started reading the book I didnt think anything would change his mind about his career. I didnt think theyd even have a little baba, I thought the book was going to be very career orientated... But I loved Colleen Hoovers ideas much better! I think Im too cliche. Ryle was a very complicated character, he looked so put together, but he was just so broken... I still think he is going to love that little girl with all his heart, but in the end, something tells me he will probably be alone forever. Atlas... Atlas... Atlas... I was rooting for Ryle... I really wish I was the type of person to just leave it at that. Lol. His character was just sad. I felt sorry for him as a youngster and Im happy things worked out for him... He was truly a good guy. But still, I was rooting for Ryle... I feel so bad saying that! I feel like a terrible person saying that... I really wish there was a second book to It Ends With Us. I loved the story behind It Ends With Us. I love what this book stands for, I think a lot of women would agree with me and say that this was a very eyeopening and inspiring book. I loved how real it was! Everything that happened was so realistic! And the connection the book had with Colleen Hoover was amazing, its one of the reasons I have so much respect for this book, for Colleen Hoover, and for Colleen Hoovers mother. I wish I could hug Colleen Hoovers mother. It would be like hugging Lily, to me she is Lily. This book was quite special to me. Probably one of the most special books in my life, I shared it with someone. Waiting for the book to come out I shared my favorite quote from the book with someone, and when that person left my life and wasnt in it anymore it hurt me to pick up this book. In the first few chapters of this book I thought I was Lily and he was Ryle, it just seemed so fitting to us, maybe it was. Maybe Colleen Hoover just saved me. In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me. To Colleen Hoover, I dont know if youll ever get to see this but if you do know I love your books and this book was truly special. I loved it and understood it in so many ways. You have no idea! You touch lives with your writing and your authors note was so sad but so good at the same time. Thank you so much for writing this book. So my lovelies this was a tough one! But a good one!
Completely out of the blue a clear dome appears over the town of Chesters Mill, in Maine, of course. A plane crashes into it. A groundhog is sliced in half. A woman gardening in her yard has a hand sheared off. How did this thing get there? Who or what is responsible? How can it be removed? This is not the Stephen King I am used to. I have been a fan since the beginning and have read the vast majority, although not all, of Kings books. For me Under the Dome kicks it up a notch. Sure there is supernatural creepiness, and an explanation that is, well, disappointing. But this is Stephen King. Duhuh. If you read the guy for his wonderful denouement explanations you probably shouldnt bother. What makes King so successful is that he writes great characters, draws you in and keeps you there once he has you, while scaring the bejesus out of you often enough to matter. He kept me under his dome for all 1072 pages. The addition to his usual toolkit this time is his expansion to the political. If Im going to spend a year writing a single draft of a book, it should be about something.  of course begs a question about the value of spending, say half a year. What is the duration of labor at which one must cross over from pure entertainment to something? Ive always been a political novelist, and those things have always interested me. Firestarter is a political novel. The Dead Zone is a political novel. Theres that scene in The Dead Zone where Johnny Smith sees Greg Stillson in the future starting a nuclear war. Around my house we kinda laugh when Sarah Palin comes on TV, and we say, Thats Greg Stillson as a woman.  scary than funny to me. Well, maybe Dome is not so out of the way for King. But while political commentary has definitely found its way into Kings books, there are few who consider him to be a political author. His other concerns usually take precedence. In Under the Dome he continues a lifelong fascination with small town life. Most of his people have significant secrets. And we get to see their character from how they cope with the stress they experience. The book took a long time to reach its final form. I started it in 1976, got about 75 pages into it  and then I saw what the scope of the thing was going to be, how many technological issues it raised, and I buckled. Im not a scifi writer; I dont know a lot about technology, so I thought Id try again, set it in an apartment building, and then I wouldnt have to deal with what the weather would be like under a dome. But I didnt like any of the characters, so I put it away.  revisited the story in the 1980s. Renamed The Cannibals it still had to do with people isolated in an apartment building. And still avoided having to cope with the technical demands of having the story set under a dome. The inspiration for the reduction in venue was a stay in a less than appealing area of suburban Pittsburgh during the filming of Creepshow. He wrote almost five hundred pages this time, but was still unable to figure out all that he needed to figure out. It was not until the new millennium that the manuscript turned up again. This time he was able to garner the expertise needed to get past his technical roadblocks. He returned to the dome notion and wrote up a storm. What would people do if stuck together, whether under a dome or in an apartment building? Perhaps a less tropical version of William Goldings classic, with adults gone wild instead of kids and without the beach. Lets just say that things do not go well, and dark forces, human ones, come to the fore. His boogey man this time is personified by that most iconic totem of dishonesty, a usedcar salesman, named Big Jim Rennie. Big Jim may be the Second Selectman in the town of Chesters Mill, but he is the real power in town. First Selectman Andy Sanders is pretty much a smiling, charming nonentity, content to do whatever Big Jim wants. And the third Selectman is a drugaddicted woman who is reliant on Big Jim and Andy for her supplies. If you might think Big Jim is a standin for a certain vice president, you would be right. All the way to his questionable ticker. It might be a stretch to see in Rennies son, Junior, a standin for Cheneys activist progeny, but maybe not. If you think Andy might be a standin for Dubya, right again, complete with an addiction issue. King sees Bush and Andy not so much as evil as weak, and the portrayal here reflects that. Rennie seemed pretty evil to me, complete with his insanely hypocritical refusal to use or tolerate profanity while behaving as profanely as possible, stealing critical supplies from the hospital, among other places, to support his meth lab, one of the largest in the country. He tells himself he is doing Gods will. I enjoyed taking the BushCheney dynamic and shrinking it to the smalltown level, he said. The last administration interested me because of the aura of fundamentalist religion that surrounded it and the rather amazing incompetency of those top two guys. I thought there was something blackly humorous in it. So in a sense, Under the Dome is an apocalyptic version of The Peter Principle.   Expanding on his CheneyBush analogy, he goes through a list of items one can associate not only with that dynamic duo but with others throughout history who have used crisis as a way to consolidate power, fomenting discord by sponsoring provocative and secretive actions think Reichstag fire as a way to cast blame on enemies, raising a private army whether in 1930s Germany or contemporary Blackwater, sorry, Xe, planning to massacre ones opponents back to the funny moustache guy again, spying on ones own citizens see Patriot Act, controlling or at least monitoring communications ditto, attempting to destroy opposing media, and so on. No one actually says Kill the Pig but if asked to, some would. It is certainly no coincidence that the evildoers here go after a truthtelling newspaper named The Democrat. There is also a countervailing force, the Jack of this scenario, although he has a name that sounds incongruous here. Dale Barbara, known as Barbie, is an exmilitary wanderer, last employed at the local diner, someone who does all he can to avoid conflict, but like a certain Corleone, keeps getting dragged back. It is interesting that the hero here is a reluctant military guy and the baddies are both civilians and cops. Note also that the honest reporter is a Republican. Keeping a hand in with supernatural elements, some town residents, particularly children, have premonitions, visions of unpleasant events to come. Gee, do ya think they might? King keeps the action moving, and all the while gives us characters we can care about, warts and all. That is his greatest talent. Dont worry about the explanation for the dome. It is the reactions of the people contained within it that matter. The Dome itself could have come out of a mystical cracker jack box. While it might have been no fun for the residents of Chesters Mill to be stuck with each other for so long, it is no chore to keep an eye on them for all 1,072 pages, through a dome, darkly.

Actual Rating: 4.5 stars But I of course think it deserves a 5 star as well. Just a half because first dystopians and sciencefiction are not my favs. Which brings me to say, that this was the best dystopiansciencefiction IVE EVER READ SO FAR!!! So yes, Im not a huge fan of those genres but this. This. Like this. Let me try to sum it up in three words: Intense. Terrifyinglyrealistic. Awesome. Yes, those should do it and terrifyinglyrealistic counts as one word. And for the first time in forever sorry I had to use a Frozen reference, I took a liking to the main female character! I found a lot of great ups and pros in this book any cons? No, I cannot think of any. So let me please convey to you a nonspoiler short review of the awesomeness of this book. How do you rid the Earth of humans? Rid the humans of their humanity. I should probably get this out into the air. Aliens are not my favorite type of fictional beings. Period. And you know theres that little, tinny possibilty that they arent fictional at all. So you can only imagine how paranoid I was reading it and how I am after. Like this book is about how these brilliantly diabolical aliens, Others, are trying to wipe out the humans and how theyve succeeded 90 of their goal. Yeah. And throw in some conflicted themes in, realistic situations and crazy as hell schemes theres a big picture to make anyone start to freak out and cry tears of desperation. But thats one of the great things about Rick Yanceys amazing writing. It sucks you in, to the point youre so absorbed by the story and you are right there along with the characters as fear takes over and youre hyperventilating. Paranoid, desperate you could feel it all and understand it. Nothing matters other than that humanity survives. Not race, religion, or wealth no status sets you apart from the other person. Besides whether youre dead or alive. Wed stared into the face of Death, and Death blinked first. Youd think that would make us feel brave and invincible. It didnt. 4 Waves First wave Lights Out. Second Wave Surfs up. Third Wave Pestilence. Fourth Wave Silencer. Fifth Wave You will find out. Rick Yanceys writing was fantastic which made the worldbuilding even more. You could see the abandoned cities, the dead husks of cars and hollow buildings. The dust and ice that covers empty places, the smoke of burning fires. The bodies of millions. The humans have become like cockroaches, huddling in isolation in groups if they can find each other. But you cant trust anyone. But if Im it, the last of my kind, the last page of human history, like hell Im going to let the story end this way. I may be the last one, but I am the one still standing. I am the one turning to face the faceless hunter in the woods on an abandoned highway. I am the one not running but facing. Because if I am the last one, then I am humanity. And if this is humanitys last war, then I am the battlefield. Cassie, short for Cassiopeia, Sullivan is one of the last people who has survived all four waves. Shes lost her home, family and life. But she has one hope and purpose find her baby brother who was taken by enemies. Enemies she isnt sure if they are humans or the Others. I took a quick liking to her, for one thing shes sensible and pretty witty. She learned to become kickbutt and damn is she a force to be reckoned when shes tearing through everything to find her brother, Sammy. And I love Sammy, cutest kid too precious to be exposed to the terrors, but sadly was. And which brings me to Zombie. I was a bit conflicted on him, but in the end he became a strong character. Oh, could I forget our mystery love interest? Of course not, Ive easily fallen for Evan Walker. But honestly you need to read about him for I cannot capture him in my review properly without fault. And this deep handsome hunk has a dark side best learned about through the book no spoilers of course: Update: Ive now realized a pretty creepy side to Evan um his stalking actually in the beginning and all... What were they thinking? Its an alien apocalypse! Quick, grab the beer! The fastpacing of the book was so compelling at times, you get paranoid and the scenes are intense. But than there are the those loveable characters that can still lighten up the mood with a single sassy remark which for a moment makes you forget about the horror and terror and maybe things will be okay. For a moment. Like the plot had me on my toes and I loved how Rick Yancey made a full circle with the story, how he tied up some things. Not all, for the alien apocalypse hasnt come to an end and the 5th wave was just starting. But heres the thing about Rick Yanceys storytelling you get suspicious and you might see something coming from miles away, but then you start doubting. You keep secondguessing until BAM you either go I KNEW IT!!! or WHAT?! OH MY GOD!!!. I loved the plot twists and how the story set in so well, it was perfect. Some things you can never leave behind. They dont belong to the past. They belong to you. The 5th Wave was an incredible fastpaced read. Its compelling and so intense I had to finish it in less than 5 sittings. Like damn, can anybody find me a book of these genres thats just as awesome? I THINK NOT!!! The characters were relatable, realistic and just kickass distinctable I adored them. The worldbuilding was spectacular, amazing like 5 stars just for that! Which brings us to the writing and plot I mean I soared through this book. Rick Yanceys writing every adjective and synonym to awesome please. Yeah throw in great characters and amazing plotline with that 5 STAR BOOK! BAM! Do I recommend? HELL TO THE YES!!! YOU MUST FEEL THE AWESOMENESS AND FEAR AND I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT!!! So you better go read this. I mean Im a bit scared of what happens next, especially with some of the reviews Ive been hearing about The Infinite Sea. But honestly Why havent you read it yet? WHY HAVENT I UNTIL NOW? I shouldnt answer that but: Because Im a terrible person. Its an eitheror world now. Z:
Originally Posted On: The Sassy Book Geek Now I know that 5 star rating makes it seem that this book is perfect, it is not. I did have some issues with it that I will explain further, but whenever I find myself constantly thinking about a book until a finish it....well I just have to give it a 5 star rating. Every single time I had to put Illuminae down to resume real life, I found my mind wandering back to its characters and plot wondering what the hell was going to happen next. For me, that makes the perfect book. Lets Talk About The Plot Where do I even start? This book was fast paced, intense, and thrilling as hell. It really did blow my mind, I loved every single second of it. The book is told through a series of hacked documents, schematics, emails, interviews, camera footage, you name it. It made the formatting an absolute treat to read through, which is why Im going to definitely recommend getting a physical copy of this bad boy. Seriously dont do the ebook, guaranteed you will not be satisfied with it. Its just something that adds a lot to the reading experience. The plot itself is what kept me reading, as I said its so fast paced. All I wanted to do was sit and keep reading until I got to the end. We start with the assault of a planet called Kerenza, which ends in a fleet of 3 ships fleeing for their lives with some of the planets refugees. From there things only get worse and worse for these survivors. I mean you think of the worst possible shit happening to these people and then it happens, it was insane! One thing keeps going right after the other propelling the story along at a breakneck speed. I felt every emotion imaginable while reading through the events of Illuminae, reading through these peoples personal messages really tugged on the heart strings at times. My anxiety levels were also constantly fluctuating from the suspense of what would happen next, every damn plot twist made me want to scream! In a good way that is. I also felt complete and utter terror during some certain plot developments, TERROR. Honestly I could gush about the story line forever, it has everything you could ever want in a scifi book! Space battles? Check. An insane Artificial Intelligence? Check. A crazy, mutating space virus? Check. Space government conspiracies? Check. Not to mention every single one of those elements comes with its own mindblowing plot twists! Yay! Of course I would love nothing more than to go into detail but I dont want to spoil anything, hopefully just those points will convince you. Lets Talk About The Characters This is where some of my issues with Illuminae arrive, with the characters. I didnt feel very close or connected with any of the characters, I believe the formatting made the experience with the characters a little detached. Dont get me wrong though, whenever any character major or minor died I was upset. I think we can thank the overall story itself rather than the character depth. It was more the manner of any deaths that was upsetting more so than the characters themselves departing. Now the only important players in this game are Kady and Ezra, everyone else is secondary which I found a little annoying. I wanted more insight into the other characters, like the ones actually directing this fleet of spaceships, and not just the two lovesick teenagers. We did explore a little bit with other characters extremely briefly, but it just wasnt enough for me to be completely satisfied. Kady was a pretty strong, badass heroine. I loved her determination when it came to saving people and doing what was for the best. Other than that though she was pretty meh, Kady really lacked any sort of personality. We never got a feel of what she liked or disliked or anything of that sort. I liked her actions, but not so much Kady herself. Ezra is the love interest, thats basically it. I said hes the other main character for the simple reason of he gets the most screentime in the book other than Kady, but really he served no real purpose except that of being the love interest. If I thought Kady lacked personality, Ezra was like a wet mop. I didnt think he was romantic at all, mostly he annoyed the living fuck out of me with all of his stupid humor. I actually cared about the minor secondary characters more than I cared about these two. Random space pilot got killed in action? Yes I felt more sadness for that kind of stuff than I did whenever Kady or Ezra were in any sort of peril. Also the AI is my favorite character, does that count as a character? Yes it does. He or it, whatever had more depth and more personality than any of the human characters did and thats really saying something since hes a computer. Lets Talk About The Romance Not a fan. Am I ever a fan, you may ask? Not really, sure there are some books that come along and make me a team romance kind of person. Was Illuminae one of those? Hell no. Honestly the book would have been so much better if there wasnt that constant romantic chatter between Kady and Ezra, it was annoying. It wasnt romantic, I didnt swoon. If Ezra and or Kady got shot out the airlock I would watch them go by and think Oh no, now what will you do? Oh yeah, maybe we can get on with the COOL parts of the story again.. I liked these two better as individuals than I did as a couple. They were not cute in the least bit. Sorry, I just wanted to roll my eyes whenever they spoke to each other. All of their banter felt really forced and I just felt zero chemistry between them. On a side not, one thing I DID like was the fact that no instalove was present. The book starts with these two breaking up therefore they had a relationship prior to the events of the story. I liked that, there was no need for any of the instafeelings because there were already feelings there. This was pretty much the only reason I found the romance to be somewhat tolerable. In Conclusion Illuminae is an action packed, thrilling, unique, scifi read. I had some issues with the characters and romance but the sheer awesomeness of the story itself and the books formatting far outweighed those issues. As I said when I cant stop thinking about a book while Im not reading it and when I go and tell every friend or family member about it that will listen anyways... because I cant contain my excitement over this book, I KNOW it deserves every star I can give it. Recommend? Hells to the yes. I honestly cant think of any reason not to recommend this to anyone. If I was ridiculously rich Id buy you all a copy to ensure the chances of you reading it now! And like I said earlier definitely spend the extra money to get a hardcover copy! Its gorgeous and the formatting will make it hard to read on an eReader and way less enjoyable overall.
 spoiler alert  This contains major spoilers....This is less of a review and more of a summary of my thoughts. My initial reaction to MJ was that it was amazing. I think the anticipation and the excitement of reading it may have clouded things for me. Now that I have had some time to think about it I do have a cuuple of issues with the book and how Collins chose to wrap up the series. And as I said this is more my processing what I read rather than a real review and I actually expect my thoughts to change on a daily basis. So dont be surprised if this changes too. First, I was disappointed in what Katniss had become  in how SC writes her. Katniss is a survivor and I know she has been through a whole lot but to keep hiding in closets, etc. bugged me. It didnt seem right. And she kept suffering from way too many injuries...it is one thing to have her get a few minor things but these were major stuff...so she was incoherent for most of the book. This seemed a waste of a wonderful character. I think SC could have still showed the results without resorting to so many injuries...just saying. Second, Katniss knew she was a pawn...so do something...she never really asserts herself but in some ways continues to be used by everyone. And when she does it seems halfhearted. I wanted her to really stick with the spark after she threatens Snow. That was the old Katniss seemed to do more of but she just disappears. Alex Bracken has a beautiful response to some of this in her blog post. Link coming later. And I might change my thoughts on this one. Third,  I am Team Gale. I know Team Peeta folks think he was perfect for her. However, I think relationships forged on extreme situations are really not true. In many ways, I would have preferred that she end up with no one if she really made that decision. However, she really never made any real decision in my opinion. I realized pretty quickly that SC was Team Peeta by the way she seemed to make Gale into something so different than he had been I know we only saw him for a short time in previous books but I had a different feeling about him. I think Gale and Peetas conversation that Katniss overheard is SCs explanation for Peeta but it stinks. Gale ending up in District 2 with some job?! WTH!! I still think in many ways there is a connection and an equality between Gale and Katniss that she and Peeta never had. You see this early on in MJ when they are hunting. Katniss has always tried to protect Peeta out of a sense of loyalty and maybe more?. I am not saying she didnt have feelings for Peeta but I think the whole Games messed with her ability to make that decision. And to just disregard Gale or to blame him for everhting  killing Prim in a way  over the top. I would have been fine in the end with her choice of Peeta if she really claimed...said I chose you because I cant live with you or something in a way that seemed like it had some fire. And Peeta still seems like a bit of a wimp with Katniss...he just comes back in the end and kind of lets her tolerate him until she gives in or something. Frankly, if I were Team Peeta I would be peeved....there didnt seem any real passion there. Again, if anyone can convince me that Peeta was her choice and she made the right decision  Brackens post can do it... I loved Haymitch and his relationship with Katniss  it was the most real and true thing in the book. I hated that District 13 was nearly a mirror image albeit a Spartan one of the Capital. I wanted hope. If you are going to drag readers through 1200 pages of war thanks Daisy W., find a way to be more hopeful to have some kind of sense of the new beginning and give readers a glimpse of that. I thought Finnick and Bogg didnt have to die. I hated losing Prim; however, if she had to kill her  why not earlier and get Katniss so pissed that she became alive and not a shell of a human. Though I am afraid that how SC was writing it, Prims death earlier would have made Katniss completely catatonic. I dont blame Katniss for being so flawed...I loved that she wasnt perfect that she made mistakes, that her feelings, words and actions werent always spot on, but something seemed off in that portrayal this time. I still cant put my finger on it. I was a little confused by Boggs statements...I thought we would understand more about that and also about President Snows comment about I thought we had promised not to lie to one another. When Coin suggested another Hunger Games...I nearly wanted to scream...why all the fighting at that point. As for the epilogue, I was left sadly unsatisfied. I always feel an author needs to conclude her story the way she envisioned it and not how readers might want it. I felt JK Rowling did that with HP whether I agreed or not and Stephanie Meyer did it with BD. But I think SC could have spent less time on the war and bombing children, etc. and a little more on buildingshowing the ending and more hope. It seemed so bittersweet. Some would say that there was hope there....Im just not sure. Overall, it was an interesting, intense, emotional ride. Collins ability to world build and create twists and turns is amazing. Unfortunately, at times I felt she failed to follow some of her own twists which would have resulted in a stronger story in my opinion. Did I like it  yes. Would I read it again...probably. I am still amazed by the world that Collins created and think that any book that could cause me to have this many intense feelings meant that it probably did what it was suppose to do.
The nittygritty: Another unique world from Schwab, a touch of Shakespeare, and a fastpaced story that flew by much too fast. Humans were too fragile for this fight, but the Sunai were too few to do it alone, and even if three could wage a war on thousands, the Malchai and Corsai werent foolish enough to get close, opting instead for prey they could catch, and kill. And so the Sunai focused on hunting sinners in order to stem the flow of violence, and the slaying of the monsters fell to the humans, and the humans, invariable, fell to them. It was a cycle of whimpers and bangs, gruesome beginnings and bloody ends. So far Ive enjoyed everything Ive read by Victoria Schwab Vicious, A Darker Shade of Magic, The Archived and so I was very excited to start her new YA duology, The Monsters of Verity. And I was thrilled to find the same magical worldbuilding and earnest writing that Ive come to love about her books. This Savage Song has a unique idea that immediately sparked my imagination: in a future America, monsters are born from acts of violence. Imagine the emotional energy from an act of murder creating a creature out of the shadows. And then imagine what type of monster would be conjured from something really horrible like a bombing or mass suicide. In Schwabs world, the characters dont have to imagine. They are living in the midst of a world where three types of monsters roam free: the Malchai, who drink blood, the Corsai, who tear people apart with teeth and claws, and most dangerous of all, the Sunai, who absorb peoples souls by first mesmerizing them with music. The story has a definite Romeo  Juliet feel to it, with two feuding families controlling different parts of Verity City. Kate Harker is the daughter of Callum Harker, a ruthless man who rules over North City. Hes convinced the Malchai and Corsai to work for him, and people can pay Harker for their safety and protection. On the other side of the Seam, an invisible line that divides Verity, is South City, where Henry Flynn and his FTF Flynn Task Force are on the front lines, battling the monsters. Flynn has a secret weapon, though. He controlsor rather, hes accepted into his familythe only three Sunai in existence: Leo Flynn, the eldest brother and the most dangerous; Ilsa, the sister who is mostly mad and was responsible for creating the Barren, a swath of burned land where hundreds were killed; and the youngest, August, who wants nothing more than to be human. Twelve years ago, an event now called the Phenomenon occurred, and the monsters came into existence. After six years of bloodshed, the Harkers and the Flynns agreed upon a truce, with each group staying on their side of the city and protecting their citizens. But that truce is a shaky one, and any small act of aggression could easily end it. Just like Romeo and Juliet, August and Kate are destined to meet. Kate, who has just been kicked out of yet another boarding schoolin an attempt to get her fathers attentionhas finally been allowed to come home to VCity as its called, where she plans to show her father that she can be just as cruel and ruthless as he is. Meanwhile, August has convinced Henry to let him help the cause, but Henrys idea of helping is for August to enroll in Colton Academy and keep tabs on Callum Harkers daughter, who is also attending the school. Kate and August do meet and form a tentative friendship, but Kate is immediately suspicious of August and knows something is up with him, she just doesnt know whatyet. But after Kate is nearly killed in an attack by a gang of Malchai, August rescues her, knowing that in order to save her, he must reveal his true nature. Uneasy allies, August and Kate are now on the run from a plot to end the truce and start a war between monsters and humans. August was definitely my favorite character, although I really liked Kate as well. August is a monster who looks human and only wants to be normal, to fight Malchai and Corsai with the rest of the FTF, but his father is so protectiveremember, hes only one of three Sunai in existence. Hes a peaceloving teen who doesnt want to hurt anyone, really. But he can only go so long without eating before he starts to get really dangerous, and so his other side must make an appearance if hes to stay sane. Kates relationship with her father was great: shes willing to kill for him if it will make him love her, but deep down she knows what hes doing is wrong. I really loved the fact that there isnt a romance between Kate and August at least not in this book. Well see what happens in the next book, but for now Im satisfied with their unusual friendship. Schwab has created an intricate world with lots of rules, and as wonderfully creative as it is, heres where the story falters a bit for me. Blame it on being an adult reading YA if you want to, but I do tend to scrutinize fantasy worldbuilding. I think anyone who has been a book review blogger for as long as I have will sympathize and agree that its nearly impossible to read for pure entertainments sake. No matter how caught up in a story I get, my inner critic is still paying attention and weighing in whenever something doesnt make sense. Such was the case with This Savage Song. I had so many questions after finishing the book, and not the sort of ooh whats going to happen in the next book questions, but rather questions about elements of the world that just didnt make sense. Why are there only three Sunai? Why does August play the violin in order to feed but Ilsa sings? The violin was a seriously cool part of Augusts characterization, but in the end it just didnt make sense. August came into being already knowing how to play the violin? But he cant really play because every time he does, people die? And the weirdest thing to me, Colton Academy conveniently has soundproof practice rooms where August can play without killing anyone? In the end, the violin ended up being more of a prop than a necessary part of the story. My other issue with the story is that I had some trouble picturing exactly what the monsters looked like, which is weird since this story is about monsters. Schwab tends to describe them in broad brushstrokes, as having teeth and claws and being made of shadows. But as poetic as her writing is, those descriptions didnt quite satisfy my need for a clear visual. There is one exception, late in the story, when August goes dark and his monstrous side comes out. But even this didnt quite do it for me. I also noticed that lots of the violent action, where presumably the monsters and humans are attacking each other, takes place off the page, and we only hear about it after the fact. Theres blood aplenty flowing through these pages, and yet I felt detached from most of the horror. Because of this, I was never really scared of the monsters, and I wanted to be. But the truth is I gobbled up this book in only a couple of days and hey, thats fast for me!. The first half of the book is a careful setup for the second half, when the story takes off like a rocket. Schwabs deliciously tragic Shakespearean ending was perfect, and thank god, theres no cliffhanger to worry about. Small quibbles aside, I cant wait to read book two, because I do love this world, and I want to know more. Big thanks to the publisher for supplying a review copy.

First read: September 2013 Second read: September 2015 4.5 stars The Burning Sky is one of those books with a premise and a cover that pretty much had me salivating. It sounded perfect for me. It hit all the right notes. And while I recognized many points on which the book could have been better, this was such an engaging and absorbing read that I loved it all the same. Lets get the elephant out of the room: the romance. It is... amazing. Irresistible. Addicting. Iolanthe and Titus have a chemistry that drips off the page. It didnt take long at all for me to be head over heels for them. It was just the right kind of development for me: starting off with mild interest, turning to disdain, turning to fervently denying any affections and trying to resist... but it being inevitable and unavoidable. All around though, the slightest mention of any affection between the two main characters had my heart pounding. It was just so beautiful. And then you end up with irresistibly adorable quotes like... Now he could work her likeness into any story of his choosing. Now he could fight dragons for her. And now he could kiss her again.  The Burning Sky by Sherry Thomas The FEELS. I AM STILL OVERWHELMED. This leads perfectly into my immense love for the main characters. Iolanthe, the elemental mage of prophecy, gets recruited to go on a quest to save the realm from the Bane, a tyrant mage of Atlantis, by the Prince, Titus. The book actually gets told from the alternating perspectives of Iolanthe and Titus. If you know me at all, youll know that Im not typically a fan of alternating perspectives. But, here it wasnt alternating chapters  sometimes they switched multiple times in one chapter, and each switch felt necessary. Not only because you see the two characters gradually falling for each other which is irresistible, as we have established, but also because they have such different motives and perspectives during their mission. Their voices, in that sense, were also really distinctive. Titus, the prince, is absolutely charming in every way, even though he can act like a prick  and does that as an act to the outside world. But his bravery and dedication run so deep that I absolutely love him. Iolanthe starts off completely frightened by the situation, and then starts resenting Titus due to spoilery circumstances. Over the story though, she develops and grows in a huge way, and by the end she is so courageous and confident, that its almost like shes a totally different person. Its character development at its very best. The plot itself had its ups and downs. The beginning was strong, with Titus coming to rescue Iolanthe and them running to safety while being introduced to the prophecy and the two wonderful main characters. The middle, however, could have been way stronger. While I liked reading more about the characters and the budding romance, the plot had its moments where I was wondering where in the world it was going. However, the end pulled it all together again. It was fastpaced, heart stopping action that I just loved, with magic, dragons, battles, political intrigue, etc. In short, it took a while to get there, but the plot was convincing too. So while for most of this book I was so overcome by feels that I managed to ignore any prevailing negatives, I do recognize that this book wasnt perfect. Most of my qualms in fact, all of them related to the world building. See, young adult high fantasy is hard to accomplish. Younger readers are less tolerant of the long exposition sections typical to high fantasy: the infodumps that create the world. However, in high fantasy, youre creating a world from scratch, so to be thorough, those infodumps are almost necessary. The Burning Sky did not contain those infodump expositions, so younger readers wont be scared off. But, this means the world was a bit underdeveloped for my taste, and I was left with a lot of unanswered questions. For instance, there are different types of magic: elemental magic, subtle magic, and mind magic. What each type entails and where the boundaries lie remains extremely vague. Also, all throughout the book I was wondering whether the people in the human world knew about the existence of magic or not  because its never explicitly stated either way. And I was also confused about the intersection between the magic realms and the nonmage realms  are they in the same plane, are they different dimensions, or what? I couldnt figure it out, and as a bit of a world building fanatic, that did bother me. I wanted a map especially of the capital city in the magic realm and I just wanted clarity, especially also in some scenes where magic was used and the descriptions were so rushed and vague that I couldnt picture it that well in my imagination. But, as a reader who obsesses over world building, the fact that I managed to ignore this issue so well, due to the overwhelming and beautiful feels, means that the book doesnt suffer so much from this. Its still an absolutely wonderful read. Heres hoping this is cleared up in the sequel! Summing Up: Seriously, this is a favorite. This is a Debby Booktm. This beautiful story, and especially the romance, had me flailing around on my bed, seriously stifling sobs and squeals. It struck me in the heart like Cupids arrow. I will be rereading this so often, and the world building issue is almost negligible at this point. I just love it! I will go crazy for an ARC of the sequel, because I need that in my hands as soon as humanly possible. GIF it to me straight! LOVE LOVE LOVE. Recommended To: People who like FEELS AKA everyone, and fans of Throne of Glass and Shadow and Bone . An electronic ARC was provided by the publisher via Edelweiss for an honest review. Thank you!
OH. MY. GOSH. This blew my freaking mind! RATING: 4.3 It was SO CLOSE! SO damn close! But I just couldnt give it a 5. Something ruined it for me but nevertheless, what a book! What a story! Down is up, up is down. Good is Wicked, Wicked is Good. The times are changing. This is what Oz has come to. Amy Gumm is a girl from Kansas. But unlike Dorothy, shes had quite a hard life. Her dads gone and her mom spends her life on the couch drinking. Shes bullied at school for being poor and for living in a trailer. One day, a tornado whisks her away to...can you guess? Yep. The magical city of Oz! But its not the Oz that shes seen on TV or even the stories shes heard of back in Kansas. Oz is now a bleak, depleted wasteland on the brink of destruction. Except for the Emerald City, of course, where Dorothy lives as crowned princess and now controls Oz. Meanwhile, Amy is stuck wondering through the reduced wasteland of Oz. As she follows the Yellow Brick Road, Amy learns the horrors of Dorothys rule and that nothing goes unpunished in the world of Oz for the slightest misstep. Fighting for her life, Amy is saved and recruited by the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked. The Order has now declared that Amy is the one that will kill Dorothy in order to free Oz from her greedy clutches. But Amys allies are just as screwed up as Oz. Amy cant trust the Order, the Wizard or even that mysterious green eyed boy who calls himself Pete. The boy gardener that no one in the palace ever sees. The only person Amy can truly trust is herself. What I loved: First, let me say that this book is for the faint of heart. I can see why this book is underrated in GR. As of now, it didnt even get a 4 rating on GR. This book is different and requires an acquired taste. It bloody, gruesome, weird, and completely messed up. So consider that before picking this book up. I absolutely enjoyed the world building and the lavish description. Oz is completely bleak because its been depleted with magic but its also filled with hopelessness. Dorothy has completely destroyed the happy place that Oz once us. Trees cant talk anymore. Muchkins have either died or been coerced to served Dorothy. Monkeys are cutting of their wings to not be subject to Dorothys magic. The whole place reeks of hopelessness. The setting was very wellestablished. On the side of the pit on which I stood, a vast field of decaying grass stretched into the distance. It was gray and patchy and sickly, with the faintest tinge of blue. On the far side of the pit was a dark, sinisterlooking forest, black and deep. Everything around here seemed to have that tint to it, actually. The air, the clouds, even the sun, which was shining bright all had faded, washedout quality to them. There was something dead about all of it. The place and even the story was weird and creepy at times. Munchkins were sassy and bossy. Crows had human ears but no brains. Forbidden apples that get you into trouble. Glinda digging up magical essences on the Yellow Brick Road. So much more weirdness and creepiness in this book. And of course, I love it! I always thought that Dorothys tale, The Wizard of Oz and even Oz was weird by itself before any retellings were told or written. I love how this book matched that and added creepiness to it. Those ideas paired perfectly with the hopeless beginning of this book. This book was so raw! Utter brutality and gruesomeness coupled with amazing fight scenes! I jabbed the blade of Mombis knife into the things eye socket. It was for Indigo. It was for me, too. Blood spurted everywhere as he slumped against the wall and collapsed. Amy and her kickass self! Shes not going to beaten easily. She sarcastic, snarky, witty, and fierce with the attitude to match. NO whiney heroine. I was ready for them when they came for me the next day. I had paced my cell all night making plans, none of them very good. If I was going down, I was going to do it kicking and screaming. Not to mention biting, clawing, and hairpulling. And of course, stabbing. The characters were all lovable in this book! They all depth and background but best of all, they all had secrets. Even after finishing the book, I didnt know whos side was on whos. Everyone has their own agenda. Even Dorothy, the tin man, the lion and the scarecrow got major upgrades. They surpassed the point of crazy on a major scale! Action packed adventures and absolute unpredictability! It was one exciting event after another even during Amys training, one of her mentors almost drowned her! The book went way off course on where I thought it would which was very refreshing. The revelation of secrets were mindblowing. I didnt expect any of them and there was no room for rest or cooling off once secrets were revealed. An event swooped right in. Really! No rest for the Wicked! I had to. It needed to come out :D What Disappointed Me: Ugh it was soo close! IT was such a fun and fantastic read too but of course... There had to be an instalove romance. Why? Why? WHY? I usually lean for romance books and I prefer books for have some romance or giddiness to it but it ruined this book! I honestly would have LOVED and possibly rated it a 5 if there was no romance involved. The book was strong even without it. The romance was light and introduced not until the middle of the book but it stayed strong long before that and it would have survived without it. Thankfully, NO LOVE TRIANGLE. The back of the book, the summary and the quote they chose for this book was a complete lie! Remove the Tins Woodmans heart. Steal the Scarecrows brain. Take the Lions courage. Im not kidding this was a complete lie. This should have been on the second book but it was put on the back of the first book. SO why? It makes no sense. That wasnt even the plot of this book! Theres probably some other flaws in this book but for once, I dont care and I dont want to see it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I dont want it ruined by thinking about that.
In a nutshell: In 2045, the world is in absolute chaos and many escape to the OASIS, a video game system that allows you to do anything you would in the real world. Upon his passing, James Halliday, the creator of the system, has developed a quest to pass on his fortune, and Wade, like many others, has his eyes on the prize. I hardly EVER give books five stars, seriously. And I also never would have gone for this type of book, or would have never gone for this book in the first place had it not been one of the books of the month for a group im part of on Goodreads. I am so glad that I was inclined to buy this book and give it a chance, because I was hooked from the first chapter. To quote one of my friends, this book is amazing for anyone with any bit of nerd in them whatsoever. Allow me to explain... James Halliday, the creator of the OASIS, an intricate video game system that allows you to basically mimic real life and live in a fantasy world In OUR world, I would say its like a mix between The Sims and World of Warcraft on drugs, died 5 years ago, and still has not passed on his vast fortune. Prior to his death Halliday hid an Easter Egg in the Oasis for one person to find, and in return, to obtain his empire. Wade, like many others, has been searching for this egg, and though he may be poor on the system and in real life, he is determined to be the one to find it and enjoy living in the real world of 2045, a crumbling dystopia where RVs are piled on top of each other as compact living spaces, food is rationed, and crime is an hourly occurrence. He has many other contenders, some including friends he has made on the Oasis, bloggers, and the bloodthirsty Sixers, employees of a large corporation planning to win the contest and virtually destroy the Oasis by charging outrageous fees for services and limit free speech. This book is a thrill ride the entire way through, leaving readers on the edge of their seats and thoroughly satisfied. Three hidden keys open three secret gates Wherein the errant will be tested for worthy traits And those with the skill to survive these straits Will reach The End where the prize awaits I dont even know where to start with this book. I loved the writing style because it was the perfect mix between simplistic and complex. What I mean exactly is that the style is simple, but its written in such a descriptive manner so that you can visualize what is happening, and the book paints a picture of the fallen world and the OASIS in your head as you go along. Its not too overbearing for those who dont appreciate action video games or even video games altogether. Because the book does have many elements of a fantasy novel. It creates its own world, its own rules, and its own words like gunters those in search of the egg and haptic chair a chair that allows video gamers to have a more realistic experience within the game. The cool thing about this book is that it IS based on our world. There are many references to popular movies, television series, and music from the 80s in addition to references to video games throughout the years. So this is also intriguing because readers will read along and say Oh I remember playing this! So this book creates a world within a world AND references the world as we know it, and I think that is pretty impressive. I love the protagonist and I love the other internet friends he makes, who are also considered main characters. Although it seems sad that basically his entire life is spent on the OASIS, right down to his education, Wade is a really great character. The author writes some of the characters thoughts in a way I normally wouldnt approve of... for instance, he frequently uses the word sucks as in the world sucks or something, but Ive let that slide because Wade is an underdog that you really want to root for. Hes basically a modern day Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if you need to compare him to anyone. Hes cunning and smart and has a quick wit. Ive probably already gushed about how much I love the descriptive imagery of this book but HOLY DESCRIPTIVE IMAGERY BATMAN. I love books that can transport me to another world. And this one did it. Its amazing also because I was not anticipating that I would like this book so much. And I loved every minute of it. I am not a video game junkie by any means. Im the typical girlie gamer. I like my Pokemon and my role playing games like The SimsI cant even put an actual number on how much money I have spent on this game over the years, its expansion packs, and versions for different gaming systems and Animal Crossing. So the fact that I could enjoy this book means that its suitable for people who dont classify themselves as nerds or gamers or sci fi lovers. So dont be too quick to judge this book before you give it a chance. So why did this book get five stars? Because of all of the reasons above, and the fact that I sat back and said So, was there anything I DIDNT like about this book? and the answer was no, there was nothing I didnt like, and there were no useless suggestions Id make to the author because I always say the author should have done THIS here and its useless because obviously the book is the authors book, and the book is already published. The ending was spectacular. Predictable, but spectacular. Because the ending is pretty predictable from the beginning. But even though I know all this, the book gets a full rating from me. I want to recommend this book to people, but i know many will just ignore it because theyll consider themselves not nerdy enough or something like that. All I can say is go to the bookstore, flip through it, tell me what you think. You might be pleasantly surprised.
5 DELICIOUSLY, HEARTPOUNDINGLY, AMAZING STARS... Loved, LOVED, LOVEDDDDDDD THIS.BOOK.SO.FREAKING.HARD!!! I NEED BOOK TWO LIKE I NEED AIR IN MY LUNGS... GIMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE................ BECAUSE... EDITED A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES was a hot and sexy retelling of beauty and the beast, that has never been seen before! Maas brilliantly weaves thrilling plot arcs, intense scenes, thick dynamics, and a utterly wonderful and compelling romance, that will leave you gasping for more of the beastly attraction that is enough to send you into a heated frenzy! Maas seriously steps up her wicked game with this hot and heavy new series, that many have adored! HOLLY HELL that was intense, and exceptionally amazing! The plot was so thrilling and engaging that it kept my heart pounding in anticipation almost the entire time. Especially when I got to the end of the book! The last 100 or so pages literally kept me on my toes routing for our badass main character Feyre to put a stake in that evil villain!! No spoilers here! ; Nevertheless, even with my ecstatic love for this book, you will never believe me when I tell you this book took me over 6 months to read! YES, you heard me right, SIX MONTHS!! And please dont get me wrong, it wasnt because it was a bad book or lacked anything crucial, quite the contrary actually. It mainly took me so long to read because I wanted it to last, and last, and last some more...lol! I enjoyed it so much that I would read a few chapters, and then start reading another book Ive been anticipating, then after a while I would get back to this for a few more chapters, and then so on and so on. But now after this long tedious journey, Im kicking myself for delaying it so long, because WOW, this book, this epically wonderful book, satisfied in more ways then one, and left me with a complete and utter content feeling, that was more then enough to have me screaming for the next book in anticipation!! A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES is a retelling of my most favorite fairytale growing up, Beauty And The Beast. I LOVED that movie as a child, and then later as I got older I fell in love with the book as well. Ive always found the connection and attraction between a beauty and a beast to be alluring and hypnotizing at the same time as fearful and horrific. So any Beast And Beauty retelling is a must for me! And A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES has exceed any and all of the Beauty And Beast retellings I have read to date!! The worldbuilding was phenomenal! I loved the deepened complexity of this world, and all the layers of depth it went to thrive and blossom into such a spectacular world, where hunger for power and control rooted the backbone, but a fiercely strong desire for love struggled to prevail! I LOVED it!! All the hardship, loss, rage, and betrayal evened with its undertone of beauty, healing, peacefulness, and mindboggling romance was a delicious combination that thicken the plot and brought this book to its full capabilities. Perfection is the word that comes to mind when I think about this book! Pure and utter PERFECTION !! THE PLOT After hunting and killing a mysterious wolf, Huntress Feyre finds her world in an uproar of chaos when a writhing beastlikecreature barges into her house demanding swift payment for the murder of its kin. The price? Either be taken outside and torn to shreds by the beasts sharp claws. Or, she can reluctantly travel with the beast back to his magical land of the Fae, where every human is bate, or at best an easy means for entertainment, and where shell be left at the mercy of the beast thats seething to kill her. With limited options, Feyre takes the latter hoping shes not the prey walking in the loins den to be eaten alive. . . Secluded, alone, and distraught in this strange land with horrifying beastly humans, Feyre is determined to bide her time until she can escape, or at least convince the beasthuman Tamlin to release her from her obligations to the treaty, and allow her to return home. But as the days pass in a spiraling turmoil of uncertainty and loneliness, Feyre starts slowly becoming aware of the strange creatures and beauty in which they inhabit. And the benevolence that they express is enough to spark doubt in what she once thought of the Fae, and what their ultimate goal really is... With a deadly magical disease called the blight spreading far and wide, and possibly even bad enough to breach the perimeter wall separating the Fae and Human world, Feyre feels like her world is constricting from within. And with the scorching romantic tension between her and her captor Tamlin growing rapid by the day, and her intense desire to completely give herself over to him, while understanding his beastly ways, and with the neighboring Courts all fallen to a lethal power, and the viscus threat Under The Mountain that could very well destroy them all, Feyre is unsure of what and where her true loyalties lie, only that she may be the key to the Fae worlds redemption, but first she must open her heart. . . I loved every aspect of A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES. All the fun plot twist, thrilling character development, and sexy swooningworthy romance was just what I was hoping for. Maas takes a new twist in her writing and brings a whole new world that will enchant and enthrall readers for years to come! This book was by far my favorite out of all her books Ive read to date. I enjoyed her THRONE OF GLASS Series, but this, this is a whole new level of epic that I just adored! I am so eager to see what Maas has in store for us next in the magical land of the Fae, and what horrors Feyre and Tamlin will face next. Overall, A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES was a fantastic retelling that satisfied in every possible way! I loved just about everything aspect of this book, and all the fun surprises and thrilling twists along the way! Sarah J. Maas has seriously outdone herself with this stunning new series! If you enjoy slower to medium paced books, with plenty of drama and intense sexual attraction, with evil Faes and realms on the brink of war, and plenty of action towards the end to make up for the lack of in the middle, and with a spiraling twist to the most beloved fairytale of all time, then A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES is a MUST for you to read!! NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Bloomsbury for reviewing purposes! All opinions expressed are my own and are not influenced in any way!
Full disclosure, Im crazy about this book. The tagline reads Six Dangerous Outcasts. One impossible heist. Its often described as teenage criminals pulling off a fantasy Oceans Eleven, even the author, Leigh Bardugo, says thats part of how she came up with the idea. And its really, really well written. If youve missed the hype or are just joining us, welcome! Let me give you a tiny bit of background: Ketterdam, where our story begins, is a steampunk city, with canals and a wealthy merchant class, criminal underground and a middleclass we get to see very little of in this book. Add to this a type of magic user than can manipulate one of a variety of unseen but ubiquitous forces. In simplest terms, magic users like a healer or an alchemist who work on something like an atomic scale. The entire continent has differing opinions on how to deal with these magic users, some hunting them, others offering them work. Our crew, a fairly diverse group, is dropped into the middle of a deal which may change the natural order forever... I have heard several people say that this book starts off slow, and if youre listening to the audiobook, that certainly can seem that way when we get into the short snippet backstories of the crew. However, I also think that you have to know your tastes. This book is a heist featuring protagonists between the ages of 16 and 18, it is a fantasy set in countries that are almost unnervingly like Eurasia, and its a big book about six people who have very different goals. But those backstories are also the reason I felt so deeply for the characters and really cared about how things went for them. Before I start gushing I want to address one thing that I found awkward: the homogeneity of the different ethnic groups. Fjerdans are all white and apparently all blonde and blue eyed, the Kerch do vary a little more but are predominantly white, Ravka has a variety of people living within its borders notably the nomadic Suli people, and the Shu Han are all dark haired and lightbrown eyed. The country Zemeni is predominantly populated by people with brown skin, but we dont see much of that country in this book except for meeting some people from that country across the sea. I found the very strict homogeneity of the Fjerdans weirdest of all, and the Shu Han as well, but it didnt disrupt me enough to do more than make note of it and continue reading. This book has a lot of groundwork to lay, but I found it to be so tightly written that there was nothing extraneous. This book has been trimmed of all fat. In fact, I only questioned the necessity of one line, and then it came back to bite me. The footwork is intricate, and I found any of the necessarily explanations kept relatively short, but I think that can come across as slow and deliberate. I guess I was so hot with desire to put the whole adventure inside myself that I didnt really notice the first time I read it. I loved the world building. I know that some people disliked the use of Eurasian countries as basis for this fantasy world, but I found it original and familiar, intriguing and comfortable at the same time. How many fantasies have been set in a pseudo England or America? I was ready for this change. While Jesper is and will remain my favorite, reading about Nina was kinda revolutionary to me. Representation matters, and I dont think you really get how that feels until you connect so soundly with a character, and read other characters seeing your likeness and respond positively to someone like you. And though Im not crushing on Matthias, the way he looked at and thought about Nina felt really, really good. I mean... the times he didnt want to kill her, I mean. As a German national, I want to note the resemblances between the Fjerdan witch hunters and SS Nazi troops. I dont know what Leigh Bardugos intent was but I dont think the comparison of FjerdanNazi is a bad one or an unnecessary one. History happened, Germany holds a great deal of responsibility in the largest scale event theretofore of its kind. An event so catastrophic a word was invented for such action: genocide. To deny that, or to deny its effect on modern history it only happened 70 years ago! is to deny the deaths, to erase the lives that were lost. So many are forgotten and their names will never be recovered. I feel that we often describe a fictional enemy as Nazis with the expectation that we will find something barely adapted to a new setting as poor, boring and simplistic, but the Fjerdans here are not this. It can also be seen as disrespectful to the horrors that were perpetrated in Germanys name during Hitlers reign, to belittle those who were killed, but I also think that this is also not the case. Firstly, the Fjerdans hold trials. True, the Grisha never win, but this is different from The Final Solution. Secondly, as far as we know, the Fjerdans dont target others based on skin color or belief. They think Ravkans are barbarians, but they dont kill them outright as far as I know. Third, there is more to this story than racial prejudice, keeping blood pure and conquering another nation again, as far as I know. It could be that there is even more than what Matthias knew and even what Brum knows. And if we could learn about the history and creation of Fjerda, I would eagerly read about that. True, the uniforms are black, there is religious superstitious rituals that tie to these heinous acts, likely the entire country shares prejudice against Grisha, and there are those who agree and those who secretly disagree. But as I already said, what really bothered me most about the Fjerdans is their homogeny so much gold hair and glacier eyes! In the end, this book was amazing, and I as soon as I finished it, I immediately began to reread it. I appreciate this book as a reader and as a writer, she clearly worked very hard on this. I loved seeing David Petersons name in the acknowledgements, even though I know she probably didnt do everything he suggested. There were so many great lines and moments. It was such an intense and captivating read. Dont wait, if this sounds appealing to you in anyway, read it! I did not read the Shadow and Bone trilogy before I read this duology, and I was fine.

That ending. That god damn ending. 3 little words killed me. To be continued Why Laini Taylor??? WHY???  Im back, and thankfully alive. I swear, after reading this book, it took me forever to be able to get into another book. In fact, I am still living in the world of Daughter of Smoke and Bone. This book was fantastic, amazing, enthralling, unique, interesting, captivating, humorous, heartbreaking, mindblowing perfect. That had to be the best book I have ever read in my entire existance and I gotta say, Ive read a LOT of books in my 14almost15yearsoflife. The way the book just came together and how everything suddenly was falling into place and my god, I was not expecting it to be so beautifully written. Allow me to explain ... When I initially started reading this book, I had no idea what I was going to get into. I knew about 3 things about this book: 1 It had something to do with teeth. 2 It had devils. 3 It had angels. What I was most definitely not expecting was to completely fall in love with this novel and its many characters. Karou was a brilliant character, one that is so unique. With her blue hair, talent for art and did I mention, a family of devils, Karou is no ordinary student. For whatever reason, she always feels like a part of her missing and that she has some emptiness within her. This is frequently said in the book and at first, I thought it meant she was missing love and a boyfriend and all that stuff but as the story progresses, youll understand exactly what is missing. She is such a deeplydeveloped character. Eventually, youll know why the title of this book is Daughter of Smoke and Bone. It remains a mystery for a large portion of the book but slowly that mystery unravels and all the clues begin to fit in place. You might think you know who is the Daughter of Smoke and Bone. I thought I did. But Laini Taylor is full of twists and I still wonder, what are you, Daughter of Smoke and Bone? The relationship between Brimstone and Karou was phenomanable. Brimstone is a fatherly figure to Karou, and although he is quite mysterious, his and Karous relationship is truly family. Brimstone is going to baffle you, you are going to wonder, what the hell does he do with all that teeth. I had many speculations throughout the book until it was finally revealed and let me tell you, anything you might have been thinking is probably 100 wrong. And thats good. The mystery is going to keep you on the edge of your seat and when you find out, the satisfaction of knowing tastes great. Another character I really liked and feel obliged to include is Zuzanna. She was a hilarious, firey bestfriend and made the perfect secondardy character. I loved her inclusion in the novel. Now I want a friend like her. And then there was Akiva. I shall use the wise words of Zuzanna to explain Akiva. Oh, hell. Must. Mate. Immediately. giggles Akiva ... Apart from his obvious dropdead gorgeous physical appearance, Akiva is the best fictional male lead I have ever read. Hes an angel but unlike those boring angels we usually read about, hes badass and hes just has that torturedhurtbutcompletelydesirable effect about him that just got me and Karou turned on high! The world building in this novel was outstanding. This book has multiple settings throughout but the whole other world was just developed perfectly. I can actually imagine being there, the evergoing war between angels and devils. Despite the feud, as we all know from the popular tagline, an angel and a devil fell in love ... The romance in this book had me over the moon. At first, I was scared that we were going to have a Twilightesque type of romance where its love at first sight. Im not going to spoil too much but there is a very good reason why Karou and Akiva have such a deep attractionconnection from the beginning. Dont be scared off with the early I love yous, it will soon make sense. It will all make sense in around the last third of the novel and at that time, the book goes from amazing to perfect. The romance was written to be perfect, and yes, I realize I am overusing the word perfect but no other word can justify how I feel about this book. When I read the big twist, as I like to call it, I almost spilt my virgin Pina Coloda all over myself mind you, I was on vacation when I read this and gave a little yelp. I hope that their romance can continue even though the rest of the tagline it did not end well is not so promising. I knew from the beginning it was going to be a sad ending, with the whole RomeoJuliet, starcrossed lovers thing, but a girl can dream. I just have to go over one more thing. The lessons learnt in this book. This isnt just another fantasy novel youre going to forget about in the next week or so. This is a book that stays with you, for a very, very long time. Laini Taylor incorporates lessons of hope and love, forgiveness and anger, and she does so without being boring. One of my favorite quotes in this novel: Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe theres no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic I just love this idea, this reality, that hope is the true magic. That even in the darkest of times, hope can save you. I just, I love that message. Maybe its corny or cliche but you know what? Some people are saying that Laini Taylor wrote what people want to hear and that we who like it are falling in her trap. But I dont really care. If I was fooled, then I am so happy that I am! This book should come with a big boldface, captalized WARNING that cautions readers that reading this book may and most likely will cause obsessive behaviour, hyperventalition and a serious case of book slump. I actually wish I could go back in time just so I can have the pleasure of reading and experiencing this novel again. Because thats what this novel was, not just any read, but a whole different experience. I cannot even begin to explain the plot. Its just so ... nope. I cant do it. I cant put the plot of this book in my own words, it cant be done. There is just so many details and every detail matters. But dont be fooled. This book is going to leave you with a LOT of questions, which will hopefully be answered in the next 2 books. My suggestion? Read this book and read it now. Read it before I change my mind and tell you not to read this book because I want to keep this precious gem to myself.  I NEED THE SEQUEL! I NEED THE REST OF THE SERIES! AND I NEED IT NOW!!!!! ... I think Im going to lose my mind over this book.  Gah, this review sucks. How come I can never write a proper good review for a book I love? Its seemingly impossible. le sigh
Actual Rating: 3.75 I actually had to sit this out a little bit before I decided to rate and review it because while I definitely enjoyed this book, there were some things that were really...bothersome to me. Overall this is a pretty solid read. I will admit, I was expecting a little bit more from it considering people are going so crazy over this series at the moment, but it is the first book and so I dont doubt that the others will improve. For me though, this just wasnt as good as I would have liked it to be, even though I did really enjoy reading it. Falling Kingdoms was an interesting story to read. There were many different elements at play that kept me involved and wanting to read. Theres politics, fighting, love, death, betrayal and magic. This first book was definitely a building block for the rest of the series but a lot of what happened was predictable and I could see the outcome of a given situation chapters before it actually happened. Ive read other fantasy series like this one before and while they were all YA, I just feel like they had a much more mature tone and feel to it. Falling Kingdoms definitely FELT like it belonged in the YA category and Im not used to that happening with these kinds of books. Its weird because, while I definitely enjoyed this book and what was going on, I didnt really connect with anything. Not the plot or what was happening in the world, the characters or what was going on with them. I was interested in the characters because they all had some very weird and heavy stuff going on with them, but as far as having an emotional connection to the story or caring about what happened to each character, there was really nothing. I think that has to do with the fact that Morgan Rhodes has NO problem whatsoever killing off her characters. In the first three chapters someone died...In EACH chapter. It was crazy. As soon as I would get a little bit comfortable that some of the characters I was reading about were safe, or as soon as I thought I was being introduced to a character that was going to be important to the outcome of the story, she killed them! Also the story is told from multiple POVs and there are quite a few main characters so I dont think I was given enough time to care about each of them individuall. Now that Im thinking on it, there was really only one character that I even liked. Not saying that I disliked any of the characters, I just didnt care for them. There were times when something would happen to a specific character or to someone they loved and I would literally feel nothing. The connection just wasnt there. Magnus, Lucia, Jonas, Cleo, Aron and Theon are a few of the main characters in this book and theyre what really kept me invested in the story because I wanted to see how all of their paths were going to cross and what was going to happen when they did. Magnus is the characters that I actually liked in this story even though hes kind of a messed up individual. Hes the son of King Gaius who is also known as the king of blood and he resides in Limeros with his sister Lucia. Magnus gives off this indifferent demeanor. He walks around life as if he doesnt care about anything but he does. Its really just a defense mechanism hes had to develop, hone and perfect in order to survive living with his sociopathic and abusive father. Cleo is the princess of Auranos and the daughter of King Corvin. Shes pretty much a brat throughout the entire story and Im only now starting to realize how much she really annoyed me. Shes 16 years old which can explain away some of her behavior but some of the things she does and says just rubbed me the wrong way. I always get what I want no matter what, was one of those things. Jonas is a poor kid living in Palesia. His father is a winemaker and he and his brother have lived their whole lives trying to provide for their family in a kingdom with nothing to offer. Jonas is a revolutionary who wants to see a change and has a grand idea on how to make that happen. Each of these characters interact and meet with one another in some way or another and these meetings arent always pleasant or even wanted. Princes and princesses, lords and peasants all crossing each others paths. And with hate and vengeance simmering just below the surface theres bound to be some blood shed. Im not going to lie, this book wasnt the best and I was quite annoyed while reading it sometimes. There was the instalove that hit me right in the trachea because it literally came out of nowhere. There was the stupid conclusions made by some of the characters that really made no sense given the actions and actual WORDS that were said to them. There was a lot of flip flopping as well. The kingdoms all worship a different goddess or person and for Limeros in particular, magic is looked upon as an evil sin. Yet...when a particular person just blatantly does magic, no one bats an eyelash. It just didnt make sense to me. It didnt add up and I feel like fantasy series are already so complex and there are already so many questions that need to be answered to begin with. Theres no need for there to be MORE confusion and continuity issues added on top of that. Overall this was a pretty solid read. I DID enjoy it even though it was just a tad bit juvenile for my tastes. I am interested in seeing whats going to happen and I will be picking up the next book in the series. Falling Kingdoms did end on a cliffhanger and I feel like if I actually cared about the characters or had some type of connection to them, Id be ordering the next book in the series right now. But because I dont, Im really not in a great rush to pick it up. There are other books I want to read first. Alot of people say that if youre new to the fantasy genre and you want to get your feet wet before you dive into the really complex stuff, Falling Kingdoms is the way to go. But Im going to have to disagree. It is very simple and easy to understand but not in a good way. Juvenile. I would say if you want to get into a fantasy series, start with Graceling or Poison Study or Finnikin of the Rock.
For more reviews and giveaways, go to  This is far too accurate! This review is, I truly believe, the hardest review I have had to write on the blog so far. How do I even begin to express all my feelings about this book? This is where I know that whatever I say will in no way truly explain the amazing, the exceptional, the heartbreaking thing that is We Were Liars. I just dont have the writing talent that Lockhart does, Im not going to be able to do her book any justice in this review. But I am certainly going to try and I am going to hope that it leads you to pick up this book and experience it for yourself. The summary of the book is one of the greatest I have seen in a long while. Its very intriguing and it piqued my interest straight away. Then I saw all the love pouring in for this book and I knew I had to hurry up and get to me eARC of it. That one line: And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.  that is beyond accurate because this has an end that you just dont want to spoil for anyone. I didnt know what to expect from We Were Liars, but it delivered everything I could have wanted and so much more. It earned a place among my favourites, a place among the list of books that has made me sob and became the first book to ever make me cry whilst reading on my lunch break at work. This was ugly crying, this was the kind of crying that made me 5 minutes late back from my break because I had to get my crying under control. I didnt know what to expect from We Were Liars, but I honestly didnt expect that. This packed a definite punch, it was gutwrenching and heartbreaking and I hated it but couldnt stop myself from loving it. Our narrator is Cadence Sinclair Eastman, the first grandchild of Harris and Tipper Sinclair, and heiress to the Sinclair family fortune. The Sinclair family are old money, they own their own private island and I might just be completely in love with them. They provide everything you need in a book; intrigue, love, mystery, drama and everything in between. Cadence looks back on her summers on Beechwood Island, which she spends with her family, including the Liars. The Liars consist of Cady, her cousins, Johnny and Mirren, and Gat, the nephew of her aunts boyfriend. And I enjoyed every second of getting to know them all and finding out about their summers on the island. Cady was a brilliant narrator for me because I couldnt trust her. This book is about discovering what happened during summer 15. This is where Cady suffered a traumatic head injury and washed up on the beach, where she was discovered by her mother. She has no recollection of what happened, why she was swimming in the sea in nothing but her underwear, or why her family refuse to talk to her about it. After she misses summer 16 on the island, Cady is determined to go back this summer, summer 17, and find out what happened to her that year. The mystery aspect of this book was perfection. You were as completely out of the loop as Cady was, you feel as completely lost as she does and it makes it so easy to sympathise with her. Her family arent telling her the whole truth and shes suffering daily pain that makes her almost wish she were dead. All she wants to do is uncover the truth and find out what happened that summer. I was just as desperate to find out as she was because I knew it was going to be something big. Cady and Gats relationship develops slowly as they spend their summers together on the island. I thought Gat was a hilarious character, but a very complex one as well. He spends his summers with them but doesnt feel an accepted part of the Sinclair family. Cadys grandfather does not accept him, or the fact that he and his uncle are both Indian and this bigotry begins to have a big impact on Gat as he gets older. He was hurting and he was an easy character to feel for, I really felt for him and the fact that no one else seemed to notice the treatment he was receiving. I loved and laughed at his hilarious one liners and moments like this, which he writes in a note to Cady: Someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments. I get the same thing spending an hour with you. Also, here is a green toothbrush tied in a ribbon. It expresses my feelings inadequately. Sweet and funny, how could I not just fall in love with that boy? Lockharts writing was exceptional and its made me ache to get my hands on more of her books. She writes in such a beautiful way, her writing was something I had to get used to. I had a moment of reading where I stopped and put the book down because of how shocked I was about what had just happened. After a second of collecting myself, I picked the book up again and realised what I had read was a metaphor and Id had a heartstopping moment over nothing. This occurred a lot for me in the book, but soon you get used to it and I loved this style of writing. I honestly couldnt put the book down, I could read this book on repeat for a week and be just as in love with it. Me after the big reveal. I didnt see it coming, I just didnt. I had no idea what I was expecting to be the big reveal about summer fifteen, but I was ill prepared for the truth. It was heartwrenching but exquisitely done. I wanted to start back at the beginning of the book and look for any hint or clue about what was to come. I still do, its only the fact I am behind on my ARCs that has stopped me doing just that. I loved this book and hated it for what it did to me. Its been a long time since a book made me cry out in utter shock, but this did it. I cried like a child whilst on my lunch at work, and I had to go back late because I needed to collect myself. Was it the end I wanted? Hell no. Was it utterly amazing and exceptional in every way? Hell yes! Look at that, Ive wrote an essay length review of this book and been absolutely unable to express how I feel. I have been unable to show how truly amazing I found every minute of this book. Ive been unable to put across my absolute heartbreak from the moment this book utterly crushed me and made me sob like a baby at work. I havent even covered everything I wanted to cover, need to cover and thats just because I cant. As hard as I try, I honestly cant seem to put into words every little thing I love about this book. 55 Butterflies More like 5 Butterflies. I adored this book, hated what it did to me and loved it regardless. My interest never waned and I fell in love with Lockharts writing style. This is one of the best books I have read and I know I will be reading it again. This book and the reading experience will stay with me for a long time, this is a book I will be forcing upon others and begging them to read. The mystery aspect was perfect, I saw nothing coming and I loved how in the dark I was to what was going to happen. I am in awe of Lockharts story, her talent, her writing. I know I have done this book no justice, but I beg you to give it a go and experience it for yourself.
There is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes do bad things. It Ends With Us is a devastating, evocative story of forgiveness, empathy, understanding, and impossible choices. I had to set this book down and step away from it more than once, I had to take moments to cry and feel and breathe. I had a visceral reaction to every page, a physical ache to forgive the unforgivable, emotional distress over witnessing such devastation, grief over all that is lost. Friendships are born and broken in these pages, lives are saved and destroyed, lessons are learned, souls are crushed, hope is restored and dashed, the people you least expect to hurt you do, the people you least expect to save you will. I felt the raw intensity of falling in love, of falling apart, every note of humor and joy and despair so acutely. I felt this book in a way I know I will never forget. Maybe love isnt something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flows, in and out, just like the people in our lives. Ryle Kincaid, Lilys present day love interest and successful neurosurgeon, is arrogant and sexy and driven and I fell for him instantly. Atlas Corrigan, the kind, affectionate teenager from her past, is beautifully broken and I loved him immediately and intensely. It was difficult to fathom a future for 24 year old florist, Lily Bloom, that didnt include both of these men who were so dear to her at varying points in her life, and my heart hurt knowing we couldnt have them both. Colleen Hoover vividly and humorously juxtaposes the past with the present, threading the heaviness of Lilys youth with the lightness and humor of her diaries to make for an emotional storyline peppered with both devastation and wit. When the two parts of her life converge, the boy from her past who had nothing and the man from her present who has it all, Lily must decide what it all means for her future. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear. Going in, I believed this was merely a romance about a woman whod have to make a choice between the two men shed loved after their paths unexpectedly collided, but I soon realized that It Ends With Us is so much more than I could have ever predicted. This story shattered me. I loved every character thoroughly, connected with them in different but equal ways, and thats why the events in this book are so inconceivable. There was no predicting the course of events that would occur within these pages. Things happened in this story that I never saw coming, couldnt believe were actually happening and everything I thought I knew, thought I believed in, became uncertain. To experience Lilys journey properly, the reader has to first be made to love these characters the way she does, then be blindsided by their unthinkable behavior as she is, and then experience the heartbreaking decisions shes forced to make right along with her... and Hoover deliberately and exquisitely ensures we do just that . I think about Ryle. I think about Atlas. I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide. Ill tell you now that this story is not what you think it is. Its different. Its bigger. Its more. Its romantic, no doubt about that. The undeniable chemistry between Lily and Ryle wars with the passionate history between Lily and Atlas to make for an emotional, tumultuous journey of love and heartbreak. But this story is something else entirely. Its a story of familial drama, of friendship, of healing and rebuilding and finding peace with things that cant be changed. Its about experiencing the best and the worst in people and deciding whats worth the risk. Its a love story... two actually... but to simply call this book a romance significantly dims the brilliance that is It Ends With Us. Colleen Hoover fans like myself will find everything they love about this author within these pages. But readers should set their expectations and preconceived notions aside because, while this story is signature CoHo, it far exceeds anything weve ever seen from her before. Hoover steps outside the box in the very best ways with It Ends With Us, but this isnt just her toeing the line. This is Colleen Hoover making a new box, a bigger box, an extensive, impressive, more polished box. Colleen Hoover just took the old box, the one with Slammed and Maybe Someday and November 9 and Hopeless in it, blew the lid off it, dumped it all inside a huge new box, so all our favorite signature COHO stuff is still in there the humor, the smart dialogue, the enigmatic characters, the captivating storyline, the heavy themes, the raw emotions. But now its a much larger box with a whole lot more stuff in it. New stuff. Beautiful stuff. Powerful stuff. Stuff weve never seen. Things we didnt expect. This new box is glorious and ugly and fantastic. Its a box of CoHo taking chances. Its a box of CoHo getting unbelievably personal while broadening horizons all at once. It Ends With Us is an exciting, fresh box filled with the old classic CoHo and a bunch of other awesome and beautiful things that cant even be named. This new box just blew my mind. In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me. This is, hands down, the best book Colleen Hoover has ever written. Is it my favorite? I dont know how to answer that. It feels wrong to describe the course of events in this book as my favorite anything. It feels wrong to call a book I wish had never been written phenomenal. But Ill call it that because thats what it is. Its the most powerful, beautiful, haunting story this author has ever delivered. Its also one of the most profoundly important books Ive ever read. I was deeply effected by this story. I felt everything this author set out to make her reader feel while reading this book. The love, the hope, the devastation, the grief, the fear, the sadness, the loss, the conflicting emotions, all of it. I got it. I was so far in this story, in these characters, on this journey, I dont know how long itll take me to find my way out. This is not a feel good story. This isnt heartwarming. This is tragic. And its perfect. Every single detail, every brick in the wall of the structure of this story, was meticulously placed by this author and it was done so magnificently. I dont know if its my favorite because this story made me feel things I dont ever want to feel again, but the fact that she made me feel THAT WAY means this story was executed perfectly, that it is, under no uncertain terms, phenomenal.
From  At A Glance LOVES!!!! I loved almost everything about The Host. I am totally going to fangirl all over this review because I cant help but squee every time I think of this book. The Good Holy Crap! I dont even know where to start. Oh, oh, I know. If you hated Twilight, never fear, The Host is 100 better. Twilight for me was a fun story about obsession more than love that was badly written. The Host is very well written and has way more substance and character development. I could go on and on about The Host and character development. Thats what made this book The Bomb. Oh yeah, I still use that 90s phrase. Im bringing it back! Each character made me feel so much emotion, so much joy, so much sadness that it felt like I was part of the story. I actually cried near the end of this book. Cried! Me, the unemotional robot actually cried! Stephenie made me care for everyone. They were all multidimensional characters with their own stories, even if their individual stories were not outright told. They had obvious depth and unique personalities. I had to know what was going to happen to them, what was going to happen next. It was a keep reading or die of deprivation scenario. Yup, I was that dramatic while reading this book. The concept was somewhat unique. Sure, we have movies and books with aliens taking over the human race, but The Host felt different. Because its from the aliens perspective and how she comes to love the humans she is meant to dominate. We have Melanie, the body, the human, and Wanderer Wanda, the soul, the alien. Though Wanda has control of Melanies body, Melanie refuses to let Wanda take complete control. She will not be silenced. So Melanie does the only thing she can, she shares memories of the man she loves, Jared, with Wanda. Wanda slowly falls in love with Jared through Melanies memories. But its when they set out to find Melanies lost love that the story really begins. Because this is not a story about an alien takeover. This is a story about friendship, love, and sacrifice. Its about what a species is willing to do for survival. Its also about finding out who you really are and what you are willing to do for the ones you love. The Host is more complex than it seems. Wanda was one of the best characters ever. She has lived many lives, in many bodies. But its Melanie, a girl who wont give up, that changes her outlook on life and humanity. Wanda takes risks for a love that has grown only from memories. But she finds mostly hatred from the rebels from which her beloved lives. Having Wanda fall in love with Jared because of Melanies memories was simply genius. I felt horrible for her when she is attacked and treated like an outcast amongst the rebels, even if I knew that it was logical for them to be cautious of her. Wanda is brave beyond reason though. She is strategic in what she says, what she shares. She knows how to stay alive. And her compassion for others is admirable. Its still hard to grasp the close friendship Melanie and Wanda had considering the circumstances. Then Ian came into the picture and changes everything...for the better. Melanie was also a very strong and determined character. She held on to her soul, her conscienceness and fought with Wanda for control over the body they shared. And her love for Jared was simply beautiful. It kept the whole story going. Jared was a little iffy for me at first, but I grew to love him like Wanda and Melanie did. He was somewhat hardened by the rough life humans now had to live, but he still held on to the kindness and compassion that seems to be ingrained into his person. Ian was a whole other story. He starts out as the bad guy kind of but he turns into the most amazing love interest ever. We should all be so lucky to have someone like Ian in our lives. He loves with wild abandoned and I admire him the more for it. There was just enough action to keep my attention the whole way through. The Host was well written and the plot was well thoughtout. The worldbuilding was interesting and had me wanting to learn more. I love how Stephenie wrote a scifi book that had less to do with the human perspective. This was about the aliens perspective. It was less about a hostile alien invasion and more about human nature in all its glory. I actually read this book years ago and I remembered almost everything about it even today. I rereadskimmed it for this review, but it was unnecessary. This book left such an impression on me that the whole story was imprinted into my mind. The Bad I almost gave The Host my rare 6 stars, but I had to concede that it wasnt perfect. Close, but not quite. The beginning is slow, as well as other parts of the novel. I still wanted to continue reading, I just wish more happened in certain areas. The Snuggly Stephenie labeled this book as Adult but its not. It has a YA feel, especially in the romance department. We only get some kissing and touching. But the sort of love triangle was freakin awesome. I really didnt know how Stephenie was going to handle the relationships in this book since it was all very complicated. But she did an excellent job of giving us a satisfying resolution for each couple. Jared and Melanie, Wanderer and Ian, it was all so romantic and crazy at the same time. Final Thoughts The Host is one of my favorite books of all time. It may not be perfect but its pretty damn close, for me at least. You will grow to love each character with ease. And the storyline will leave you wanting more. Trully, this is not a book to be missed. Highly recommended. Quotes Its not the face, but the expressions on it. Its not the voice, but what you say. Its not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful.  I love you, I whispered. Dont say that like youre saying goodbye. But I had to. I, the soul called Wanderer, love you, human Ian. And that will never change, no matter what I might become. I worded it carefully, so that there would be no lie in my voice. If I were a Dolphin or a Bear or a Flower, it wouldnt matter. I would always love you, always remember you. You will be my only partner.  I held you in my hands, Wanderer, and you were beautiful.  You are the noblest, purest creature Ive ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you, he whispered.
4th read August 2017 How do I love Six of Crows? Let me count the ways... If you dont know, and you should by now, since I mention this duology pretty frequently, this is a heist story. I love heists hit me up with your heist recommendations if you have any, so this plot was always going to be a winner for me. But, on my fourth read, what really stands out is just how exciting this story still is after all this time. Its a quick read, respite the enormous size of this paperback, and it also manages to have a lot of character depth. You have six protagonists, five of which have their own POVs and yet we also get these intricate backstories. Basically I could talk about the perfection of this book all day, every day, so dont get me started! For more bookish content check out www.cartonmanettedarnay.wordpress.com 1st Read January 2016 Um, so why in the world did it take me so long to get this book? Im hoping to get a proper review up sometime tomorrow, so see you then So, the majority of this review will be ever so spoilery, but fear not I will warn you when we reach that part. Ive only Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo, and I loved it so why I havent finished the series is a mystery, by typically me. I wouldnt say you needed to read that trilogy before you read Six of Crows because they are not connected, however would definitely say you should either read the whole trilogy or not to have read any of it. Because I had read Shadow and Bone, I knew enough about the characters and the world to pick up on a few things that I think gave away a pretty important plot point. It is a bit frustrating because, like I said, if I hadnt read Shadow and Bone, I would never have picked up on it since it was such a fleeting reference, but what can you do? I still intend to read the whole trilogy at some point in the future, but am definitely more exited for the sequel to Six of Crows. Leigh Bardugo is such a beautiful writer, which can be seen throughout this 500 page book. The narrative is so fast paced and so full of twists and turns that the books feels almost like a heist film. Like IaEURtmve already said, I am familiar with the world, and it was just and interesting and vivid as I remember. I am a city girl at heart so I did prefer to hear about the bustling city life of Ketterdam that what we saw in Shadow and Bone, but thataEURtms just me. Bardugo successfully created this beautifully gritty city that is still so vivid in my mind that I feel as though IaEURtmve been there, and as grim a place it is, I sort of want to go back under Dregs protection, of course. There were no parts that I thought could be cut out or were superfluous which meant that I was gripped by the whole 500 pages. In fact, I loved this book so much that I put off reading it, just so that it would last for longer, which is a fist for me. I have always been a lover of heist plots so it was always going to be a win, and this one was just something else. I just really cannot sing the praises of this book enough. So now is the time that I am delving into things that may be considered spoilers but they are not plot related. The reason for this is because the main reason I love this book so much is because of the ships, all of the ships. Now, if you dont consider the ships to be spoilers you may already be aware of them then by all means read on. So there were two ships that I was 100 invested in and the first was Kaz and Inej. Kaz is definitely my favourite character because he was so complex and so flawed. I can just tell that he will be one of my alltime favourite characters for years to come. One of the things that I loved about the characters in this book was that every one of them have their own backstory that make them who they are, including Kaz. He has certain issues that make him really quite vulnerable and yet despite this he was also so strong. I think this can be said for all of the characters involved in the heist, that they showed how you can be both strong and vulnerable and the same time, and that having a weakness does not make you weak. I think it was endearing to see how much he cares for Inej, and viceversa. But while it was super cute, there was a certain point where Kaz asked her to do something and she made a really good point. That point being that neither could aEURcureaEURtm each otheraEURtms weaknessaEURtm, something which you see in YA fiction frequently, but not here. The other ship that IaEURtmd been on board since his first chapter is Nina and Matthias. Who doesnaEURtmt love a relationship that blurs the line between love and hate so much. Both, but especially Matthias, have so much confusion and uncertainty over what they feel it makes their relationship seem so real. I adored how sassy Nina was, even since they first met and how serious Mathias was, which meant that they sort of bounced off each other. TheyaEURtmre a couple who just shouldnaEURtmt work but they do, and they do it so so well. Neither of them are perfect, and I was swearing at Matthias at a certain point, but they both want to atone for their sins and thataEURtms what I like about them. For a change I actually was able to relate to both Inej and Nina, and found myself loving the friendship between them. Also Matthias sounds very hot, and IaEURtmm not complaining. On the subject of hot guys, IaEURtmd definitely say that Kaz, in my mind at least, was also pretty fine. Dare I go as far as to say that the sequel to this book is my most anticipated book of the year? Yes, I think I do. I wouldnaEURtmt even be surprised if this is my book of the year, because itaEURtms definitely a very, very strong contender. Either way Six of Crows has right up to being one of my top five favourite books ever!
From  6 effing stars. At A Glance I. Die. You know the dreaded question: If you were stranded on a deserted island and you can only bring five books with you, which ones would you bring? Most readers would panic because the idea of only 5 books is sickening, but it seems that question is not so hard for me anymore. Because, hands down, The Sea of Tranquility would be one of those five books, and I would enjoy it again and again for years on end. Thats why I had to give it my rare 6 stars. The Good I had to wait some time to write this review after reading this book because I needed time to let the awesomeness soak in. If I hadnt, I would be a rambling mess of emotions. Even now, I dont know what to say. How can I describe the perfection of this book? Maybe its not perfect for everyone but I can guarantee that most of us readers will fall madly in love with The Sea of Tranquility. Right now this book has almost 14,000 ratings on Goodreads and is averaging a 4.56 star rating. Thats pretty damn amazing. Let me start off by saying that this is not a perfect romance. This book is more about two troubled souls, who have horrible pasts of lose, who find kinship with each other. Its a slow build and its so worth the wait. Nastya and Josh remind me of the peanut butter and jelly in a PBJ sandwich yes, thats what I had for lunch today. They couldnt be more opposite in their structure, in their overall essence, but together they meld and blend into rightness. It just takes that one time for them to come together and you know from then on they should never be separated. And then you see how similar they really are. And let me also mention that this book may seem slow in the beginning, but believe me, it needs to be that way. You cant jump into something like this without having your heart be ripped into shreds. You have to be eased in. This book packs so much emotion that I still feel raw weeks after reading it. The writing is not just words and sentences. Its art incarnate. I dont know if I have read a better written book in all my life. The dialogue is both witty and soulful. The pacing is perfect for this kind of book. The characters inner thoughts broke me, then healed me, then broke me again. I was an open wound for a couple days while reading this book, and I loved every minute of it. I think my bottom lip even quivered from time to time as I forced myself to hold back the tears. This is definitely a character driven novel. Millay goes above and beyond when making Nastya and Josh into real people. I never once thought that I was reading a book. I felt like Nastya and Josh were recounting their lives up close and personal. Even the side characters like Drew became real to me. I know these characters more than I know any family member, best friend, or even myself. I dont think anything with a beating heart could not feel bad for Nastya. She went through a heartbreaking and tragic experience that no one should have to endure. And because of this event, she has stopped speaking, to anyone. Being mute can make it hard when you go to high school, but when you dress like a Russian hooker on purpose, its apparent no amount of teasing or bullying will ever affect you. Nastya is the living, breathing version of the doorknob sigh reading Do Not Disturb. Everything she does is to keep people away. After losing a piece of her soul, she wants nothing to do with the world. But then she meets Josh. And for the first time in a long time shes interested...interested in interacting and living. Nastya is troubled and emotionally fragile but she is also a very strong person. She has to be with what shes gone through. Shes bright and talented, even if she doesnt think so anymore. But what she needs is to heal. And even Josh may not be able to do the job, because sometimes we have to heal ourselves first. Josh has lost everyone some way or another. And when everyone close to you seems to die, you kind of become a social void. The high school kids are a little afraid of Josh and he likes it that way. Hed rather be left alone. Then the mute and exotic Nastya comes into town stirring controversy and Josh cant help but notice. But its not until Nastya starts forcing herself into his daily routines that Josh starts to see the girl no one else sees. He sees someone emotionally damaged but beautiful nonetheless. Shes unique and mysterious and Josh wants to solve the mystery of her past but he lets Nastya reveal things on her own time. He gives her the space she needs and offers her security in his house and his garage where they work on his woodworking together. Josh is quiet and understanding, which is exactly what Nastya needed. The Sea of Tranquility was powerful, deep, and beautiful. It has everything a reader can hope for in a book. The plot was well thought out and executed amazingly. And the mystery behind Nastya was handled so well I still feel tense from the suspense. Ugh, I wish I was a better writer because I still dont think I even skimmed the surface of what this book is like or how it made me feel. Its indescribable. I have to mention how perfect that ending was. I was a little nervous it was going to be a sad ending but no, it wrapped up everything very well and even has the best last sentence ever in the world. My heart broke into happy little pieces then formed back together stronger than before when I read the last page. The Bad How dare anyone suggest something is bad about this book!!! : The Snuggly Mercy! Nastya and Josh have the most complicated, messed up relationship. They start out ignoring each other, then become awkward friends, then you think there can be more after a special night, then Nastya ruins it all, then Josh makes it worse. You will want to yell and scream when it comes to these two. They are both emotionally stunted and how they even became friends is beyond me. But you will also love them to the little red recesses of your heart because no two people deserve to be happy more than these two. We get a sex scene that isnt graphic. Its appropriate for YA readers. However, there is a sexual assault scene. So be prepared. Final Thoughts Remember, this is not a full blown romance type of book. The romance and relationship building takes forever, but its perfect for this book. You just have to give it time. This is a character driven book with a lot of tragic elements but has inspiring moments in it that makes it so worth all the heartbreak. VERY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Quotes People like to say love is unconditional, but its not, and even if it was unconditional, its still never free. Theres always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they wont be happy unless you are ... I just dont want that responsibility. I wished my mother was here tonight, which is stupid, because its an impossible wish. He shrugs and turns to me, drowning the smile that cracks me every time. Its not stupid to want to see her again. It wasnt so much that I wanted to see her again, he says, looking at me with the depth of more than seventeen years in his eyes. I wanted her to see you. There are so many things that can break you if theres nothing to hold you together. Were like mysteries to one another. Maybe if I can solve him and he can solve me, we can explain each other. Maybe thats what I need. Someone to explain me. People who go around advertising their birthdays are douchebags. Its a fact. You can look it up on Wikipedia.

I have not read fantasy in a very long time, which made getting into this book hard at first, but then I fell in love with the setting and characters in this world and could not stop reading. This book defiantly has a lot of hype surrounding it, which made me go into this book expecting a lot. I did really like this book, but I went into it thinking it would be somewhat like Hunger Games, but it is most defiantly not. I wish that this book would not have been compared to any other books since it threw me off when the book was different. With that being said, I did still really like this book. The writing for the book made it extremely easy to read. Usually fantasy books are full of indepth descriptions that get daunting to read, although I do understand why they are needed, but Maas was able to write a fantasy book that was both simplistic and dynamic at the same time. I thought that Maas did the perfect amount of describing without overloading my brain. I also liked that there was a pronunciation guide at the book to help readers pronounce characters and places correctly. I thought the pacing of the book was really good as well. The beginning started right away with big events happening, but it was a little confusing until I got a handle of the writing style and names of characters. The book was slower in certain areas, but I never got bored and the end was extremely fast paced! I liked that this book did not end on a cliffhanger, but still interested readers enough to continue on with the series. I really enjoyed the world that Maas created and am really excited to see what she plans on doing with future books. I felt like the world was indepth enough for avid fantasy readers, but still simple enough for readers new to the genera. I also really liked that the plot of this book had a mystery, which was one of the reasons I loved this book. I felt like this book had enough twists to keep readers guessing, but also provided significant foreshadowing that readers were not left in the dark to what was happening. I was disappointed in the challenges the competitors had to undergo since this book was compared to The Hunger Games, which it was not like. The challenges were not that exciting, which I thought would be one of the best parts of this book and I also didnt like that the majority of the challenges were not even described in the book. I would have thought that the challenges would be harsher considering how the book describes how horrible the King is. I would have thought the competitors would die if they failed or that the tasks would be a lot more life threatening. I am glad that there will not be a competition in the next books because that is what made me rate this book as only 4 stars. I absolutely loved the characters in this book. Celaena was such a kickass heroine that I really enjoyed reading about. I liked that she was strong and witty, but still was able to be girly and dress up. Although the book describes Celaena as being 16 years old, I would have guessed her to be 1820 years old, which I liked because I usually dont like reading about characters that are really young. I really liked Celaenas two love interests, Chaol and Dorian. I liked that the two men were really charming, but flawed at the same time. I felt like the first half of the book was dedicated to learning about Chaol and the second half was dedicated to Dorian, which really made me have equal love for both of them. They are both very swoonworthy and I really want to see where the next book takes this storyline. I also really liked the relationship that development between Celaena and Nehemia. Nehemia was also a very strong, female heroine who is defiantly worth rooting for. I loved that she has ulterior motives for being at the castle and I really want to see Celaenas and Nehemias relationship grow. This was one of the best love triangles that I have ever read, which I loved every minute of it! Maas created the most equal love triangle and I have no idea who I want Celaena to end up with. Both Chaol and Dorian are prefect in every way and care about her deeply in different ways. I love that Dorian jokes around with Celaena and is not afraid to express how he feels about her. He is more reckless with his feelings and goes for what he wants. I loved the witty banter between Dorian and Celaena and found myself laughing out loud at many of their conversations. Dorain is completely different from Chaol, in that Chaol is a lot more reserved and holds his emotions in. At times, it only felt like a slight love triangle since Chaol does not openly express his emotions. Although both men are complete opposites, both are entirely wonderful and worth Celaenas time. I have no idea who I am rooting for at this point and I really hope the second book will expand on Celaenas relationship with Chaol. Overall, this book was very good. I am so happy that it is going to be a series and I will get to keep immersing myself within Maass world. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if you do not like fantasy. I really think this would be a great book for readers who are interested in the fantasy genera, but dont know where to get started. However, I do think that more mature, fantasy readers may be underwhelmed with this book because it does not really focus on the magic aspect as much as it does the romance and mystery.
Rating: I just . . . I cant . . . I cant even talk about this book without wanting to either a Hunt down E. Lockhart and slap her b Bawl my eyes out c Crawl into the book and retype half of the sentences that were used because They are Written In this Strange And Extremely infuriating Style. d Leave my house right now and go find me some Liars But at the same time, this book without a doubt received 5 stars. My favorite of all time. Plot: I will start out by saying that the Sinclairs are a super rich family Warbucks rich, most of the money coming from Harris Sinclair, Cadys grandfather, and they own a private island that they visit over the summers. The Sinclairs are also not very nice people. 17 year old Cadence Sinclair, aka Cady, narrates this novel with flashback and present chapters. Cady has four main friends on the island who are all her age: Her cousins, Mirren and Johnny, and family friend, Gat. Gat did not always visit the island, though. But when he did begin coming, the four children became The Liars. Why, I do not know, they dont really lie that much. These kids are INSEPARABLE. Over the years, the kids band together even more, and Gat and Cady explore a very complicated romance with each other. The plot centers around the summer when Cady was 15. She was in an accident that she doesnt remember. All she recalls is waking up in the ocean, mostly naked. She doesnt know how she got there or why she was swimming or where the Liars were when it happened. All she knows is what the Sinclairs will tell her. Since the accident, Cady has suffered unbearable migraines, has cut her hair and dyed it black, and has been on a countless number of medications. Her mother tells Cady that she has told her what happened that night before, but Cady always forgets what her mom told her the very next day, and so the doctor ordered that no one tell Cady what happened during Summer 15 due to the stress it causes her. And so, Cady, with no help from the Liars, for they have not contacted her since Summer 15, is forced to piece together the mystery of what happened that night all by herself. Characters: The characters in We Were Liars sometimes feel so real that you think they are actually your friends. And other times their personality seems so fake that you know you are reading a story. But that falseness added to the character of the book. The Sinclairs are not perfect, they are far from it, but they are so . . . mechanical. It is like they have no feeling at all. The only ones who really seem to care are the Liars. Cadence Sinclair Eastman: Her metaphors and flashbacks are skewed and blown out of proportion, she complains about everything, and she is just a pretty annoying narrator. But, she writes these eyeopening stories that relate to the plot but also relate to everyday life. I will remember her story forever. Mirren: She is sugar and curiosity and rain. I love that description. I like it because it doesnt make sense to me. Most of the content in this book didnt. But that is what made it so good; I had to constantly be thinking about it to understand. But back to Mirren. I love her character during Summer 17. I think that she is a better person that summer than before and that she has learned from her experiences. I love that about her. There is not even a Scrabble word for how much I miss reading about her. Johnny: His Lego tuna fish taxidermy. Im not sure why, but that was one of my favorite parts of the book. Maybe it was Johnnys quirkiness that cheered me, or maybe it was that he and Cady were so close after he messed with her and Mirren when they were younger. Im not sure but I loved the scenes with Johnny and Cady together. They are so sweet and they care for each other SO MUCH. I also loved the scene where Cady finally starts to remember Summer 15 and she goes to Cuddledown and lays on the floor next to Johnny and they have a heart to heart. So touching. He is definitely my favorite character. Gat Patil: Gat, her Gat. He is just so . . . Gat. Ive begun using Gat as an adjective. There is no other way to describe him. He is just too perfect. Raquel though . . . boy . . . I wanted to . . . and those beach roses... the hammock . . . so many times . . . I love you Cady, I really do . . . to Cady with everything, everything . . . Sigh . . . During Summer 17 there were parts where I actually really hated Gat. He wouldnt admit to loving Cady and he wouldnt tell her anything. I guess no one would tell her anything, which I think is the dumbest thing Ive ever heard, but Gat was Gat! He was the one I expected to tell her everything! He wanted to start over but then kept bringing up past problems and pushing Cady away. Make up your mind! And then he would be super sweet and I had to forgive him. He was ok as a friend, but a wonderful boyfriend. Harris Sinclair: Grandpa Sinclair. Hilarious man. Definitely a jerk sometimes, but overall I think he had a good perspective on life in general and knew what he was talking about. Author: E. Lockhart is a brilliant woman. Thats all I can really say. Overall: I love this book so much; it is my favorite. It book humored me and frustrated me and deeply saddened me and angered me in so many different ways that I cannot even begin to explain. And the ending will shock the pants off of you. If you are thinking about reading it, please do! You are in for a treat! You must also be prepared to endure at least one week of being emotionally unstable after finishing it. Now, in my opinion there are two types of books in this world. Those that you read and forget about one week later, and those that you read and remember until the day you die. We Were Liars in one of the latter. This book grabs you and shreds your heart and plays with your emotions so much that I barely remember anything about the week that I read it. Everything kind of blended together. . . . My only focus was this book. That means something to me. That this book will burrow down in my brain and reappear to me one day. This story MEANS SOMETHING. It teaches lessons and gives you something to hold onto. It grounds you and keeps you thinking and you never get bored with it. When I put the book down, I wanted to pick it right back up again. I finished it in less than 24 hours. This definitely deserves a reread! I do wonder, however, what happens to Cady. I mean, if what happened to her happened today and we heard about it on the news, someone would be getting in trouble. Whether that be a fine or an arrest, I feel like Cady would not have gotten off without any kind of punishment. Unless her family really is that good. . . . Usually I can predict the end of a book or the climax or the turn of events, but this one? BLEW. ME. AWAY. Out of the water. The twist! Oh God, the twist . It was insane. It made me insane. I dont even know. Maybe because Im insane. Recommended To: Everyone! Please read this book! If you only ever get to read one novel, make it be this one!
Welcome to the OASIS. The OASIS is a place where you can forget about the real world. You can forget about the fact that the Global Energy Crisis has turned North America into a wasteland. You can forget about the fact that youre living on the twentyfirst floor of a stack of shoddy trailers held together by makeshift scaffolding. Here in the OASIS, you can live a different life. You can go to school, go shopping, discover superpowers, complete quests, and make friends. In the incredibly realistic simulation, you can live the life youve always dreamed of living completely free of charge! Just put on your visor, strap yourself into your haptic suit, and enjoy your immersive experience... Ready Player One has a fascinating premise. Reality sucks in the year 2044, so most people live their lives in a video game called the OASIS. This advanced simulation makes everything in the virtual world seem real. The games creator, James Halliday, has died and left a will where he states that he has hidden three Keys in the game that open up three gates. Whoever gets through all three gates first and finds the Easter Egg that Halliday has left will win his entire fortune 240 billion dollars. For years, gamers have been trying to find the keys. These devoted people call themselves the Gunters. These people have been studying up on 1980s pop culture their entire lives, because thats the decade that Halliday had a huge fascination with, and therefore will most likely play a big part in finding the keys. The search has dwindled in recent years because of a lack of leads, but one day, a teenage gunter named Wade Watts gives the search new life when he discovers the first key. Ready Player One, much like the OASIS located within it, is inventive, immersive, and addicting. The premise which I spent so long explaining to you is incredibly original and well thoughtout. The storyline is really unique. The pace is slow at the beginning because there are a lot of descriptive paragraphs highlighting the different aspects of the world that the author has created. These infodumps are fairly lengthy, but very engrossing. Once the race to find the egg launches into full gear, the pace changes. There are moments when the pace is quick, and there are surprisingly tense action and violence scenes. Then the pace will pull back to allow you to catch your breath and grasp the bigger picture. But I was never bored. I was hooked on every page, whether it was a detailed description of a new setting or a lifethreatening action scene. The book is strengthened by a healthy, diverse cast of characters. Because so much of the book is spent in the OASIS, we actually see more of Wades gaming avatar, Parcival, than we do of Wades real appearance. Even still, theres a lot of character development. Hes a very relatable, likable teenage boy who doesnt really fit in anywhere. But he has a strong personality; hes cunning, compassionate, and has plenty of attitude to go along with it. I thought his first person perspective was entertaining, and showed us a great deal about the kind of person he really was. The supporting cast is also strong, even though again we dont actually know what they look like in the real world for the vast majority of the book. Aech, Art3mis, Daito, and Shoto, Wades gunter rivals and friends, each have very distinguishable traits that make them easy to tell apart. There are so many people to root for, and so many people who are easy to despise. Despite the fact that real physical descriptions are missing for most of the book, the fantastic characterization makes it easy for readers to feel an emotional connection to the story. Another thing I loved was how connected the virtual and real worlds were in the book. There are so many ties between the OASIS and reality. If you make a mistake in the OASIS, there are consequences in the real world as well. For example, one of the gunter groups searching for the egg are the Sixers, a group of avatars who work for the IOI, a huge corporation that plans to take over the OASIS and turn it into a business with monthly fees and advertising. They plan to kill the spirit of the game to make profits. When Sixers feel scared by the progress of rival gunters, they threaten and manipulate them not only online but in the real world as well. I thought the weaving of the virtual and real worlds was expertly done, and gave the book a bigger sense of urgency and suspense. As I touched on before, there are a lot of references to 80s pop culture in the book. It was Hallidays obsession when he was alive, and therefore, the hunt for the egg involves knowing a great deal of trivia from that decade. 80s music, film, and video games especially are all highlighted extensively. If you grew up during that time frame, you will be charmed by the references, and you may get very nostalgic. This book is definitely for you. If you did NOT grow up in the 80s, you may not exactly get all the references, but there are still so many things that Ready Player One offers to a reader. I myself did not grow up in the 80s, so some of the pop culture trivia mentioned was new to me. But I still loved the book. The concept was intriguing, the characters were easy to connect to, the little romance was wellcrafted, and the story was so easy to absorb. Do not shy away from this book because you are scared that you may not be the target audience. Cline has successfully written a book that will appeal to people of all ages theres something here for everyone. Ready Player One really took me by surprise. I never expected to enjoy such a geeky, nerdy book as much as I did. Ready Player One is not just a throwback to the days of old. Its a thrilling, chilling story that will make you laugh and cry, and it will never lose your interest. Whats more, this book is a gentle prod in the back to a society becoming increasingly dependent on technological advances. Its a subtle reminder that though we may try to hide from the harshness of our lives in technology such as games and virtual simulations, the only place where we can find true happiness is in reality. Because, as Halliday himself simply puts it, reality is real. Pick this book up, I implore you. You wont regret it.
Originally posted at City of Books   OHMYGOD I loved this book so much! Definitely better than Shatter Me, and if this series keeps getting better then I absolutely cannot wait for book 3! Unravel Me was even better than I expected, and believe me, I had very high expectations. There was just so much in this book  fastpaced plot, loads of action, very shocking twists, and swoonworthy romance! I liked Juliette a lot better in this one, she really came into her element. Shes a lot more dangerous and unpredictable in this book, and I found that fascinating. Her power is unbelievably immense, and no one knows just how strong she is. But despite the fact that so much has changed for her, shes still as good as she was in Shatter Me. Shes still on the right path, and her newfound strength hasnt made her arrogant or vain in any way. I really felt for her in this book, because her anguish was so unbearable to see! Even I wanted to punch someone in the face when she got mad. Juliette faces a lot of dilemmas in Unravel Me, but I think she made the right choices. Shes very selfsacrificing, always putting the safety of others before her, and she definitely deserves a lot more happiness in her life. Heres to hoping she gets that soon! Adam, on the other hand, I didnt like very much in Unravel Me. I honestly loved him in Shatter Me, but he seems to have had a personality change in this one. Hes too clingy, too whiny. Honestly, the number of times he begged in this book... I was quite disappointed in him. What happened to the awesome guy we met in the first book? Not to say he isnt still awesome, because he is. His love for Juliette has grown, and we see the lengths he is willing to go to, so he can be with her. I found myself feeling sorry for him a lot of times in this novel. Even though he annoyed me sometimes, I still want him to have a happy ending. Adam gets a huge revelation in this book, and it really shocked me. I was left staring at the page with my mouth hanging open, and again I felt so sorry for Adam! He really is a sweet guy, but Im still Team Warner all the way. Warner. The reason I read this book. Just kidding, I would have read it anyway. But Warner made it so much better! I was desperately reading this book as fast as I could just to meet Warner, and when he finally showed up, my reading pace slowed down. That first scene with him was incredibly sweet, and I knew then that I would love this book. We find out Warners first name, and I think it really suits him! I now think of him by that name, and not Warner, because thats how he wants Juliette to think of him. And chapter 62? Oh my god. I had heard a LOT about chapter 62 before I read this book, and I think it was the most anticipated part of the book. And man, was it good! I read it as slowly as possible to drag out the moment. Let me just say that Team Adam peeps arent going to be too happy with this scene ; Oh, and theres some other stuff we find out about Warner, very exciting stuff that made me very happy. Wow, I just realized how many secrets are revealed in this book! There were so many awesome moments between Juliette and Warner, and it was nice to see them talking to each other normally, like friends, slowly getting to know one another. Its like the events in Shatter Me didnt even happen, because theyve moved past it. Theres this one quote I found hilarious  Do you like Shakespeare? he asks me. An odd segue. I shake my head. All I know about him is that he stole my name and spelled it wrong. You dont normally find Juliette making jokes, so this was quite unexpected. And I think it shows that maybe Warner brings out the best in her. With Adam, shes usually quiet and sad and selfloathing, but with Warner shes actually normal. And yeah, Juliette is meant to be with Warner, I dont care what anyone else says! I want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. I mean seriously, how can you not love this guy?? Okay, enough of Warner... for now. Kenji is the humourous reprieve in this somewhat serious book. Seriously, he had me laughing at so many parts, since he makes jokes at totally inappropriate moments. He really reminds me of Roar from Veronica Rossis Under the Never Sky series. If youve read that, I think you would agree with me. Kenji is easygoing and very smooth, but he does show a lot of wisdom in this book. He keeps Juliette grounded, and I quite liked the pep talks he gave her. I never thought Kenji could be so intense! I really want a novella from his point of view, because Id love to get inside his head. Even though Kenji is the easiest to talk to, no one knows much about him or his past. And thats the Kenji I want to know. Nothing will ever be the same again. Man, is Juliette right when she thinks this! Unravel Me changes a lot of things in the series, and puts some perspective into them. The war is near, and the people of Omega Point are as ready as theyll ever be. With Warners dad heading the Reestablishment, things are looking grim. But Omega Point has something that the Reestablishment doesnt  Juliette. And theyll use her to gain the upper hand. Tahereh Mafis writing is, of course, beautiful as always. The words flowed off the pages so smoothly, kind of like butter. And the strikethroughs were still there, though less than in Shatter Me. I liked seeing those there, because they tell you a lot more than the actual words do. Theres this one quote that really got to me, and I applaud Tahereh for writing it this way because it has that much more of an impact. What I really want to say is who the hell are you and who are you to decide who gets to die. Who are you to decide who should be killed. Who are you to tell me which father I should destroy and which child I should orphan and which mother should be left without her son, which brother should be left without a sister, which grandmother should spend the rest of her life crying in the early hours of the morning because the body of her grandchild was buried in the ground before her own. This amazing writing on its own is enough to make me love this book, and its just so emotional! Unravel Me on the whole is a fantastic sequel to Shatter Me, and it set the scene perfectly for the final book. I honestly dont think I can wait a whole year to find out how Juliettes story ends! I want to read this book over and over again until I get book 3, and I know I wont get bored. Not with this epic plot and awesome characters and elegant writing.
I bow down to Miranda Kenneally and her awesome writing skills. Things I Cant Forget is such a powerful story about beliefs, faith and how the definition of right and wrong might not be so black and white. But Emily made a mistake. I use my black coloring pencil to shade her hair. My red pencil fills in her lips, turned upside down in a frown. And then I made an even bigger mistake: I helped her. In this story we meet Kate a teen who loves God, art and her family. She is very strong in her faith having been brought up in the church. She feels she was taught right from wrong and that it is a fine line you cannot stray from. But when her best friend Emily finds herself in a jam and needs Kates help she comes to the rescue but at what price? Kate feels guilty and it is a guilt that she carries around with her. My dad says gossip never goes away, no matter where you are in life. I really found myself identifying with Kate. While I was never as strong in my beliefs as Kate is, I can relate to always wanting to do the right thing and worrying when others are straying to far from the correct path. When Kate goes to camp to be a counselor and reconnects with Matt, who she knows from attending the camp herself its a true test of her faith and her beliefs. Matt is the lifeguard at camp who is definitely someone that Kate likes looking at. These two have some laugh out loud moments. When Matt starts flirting with Kate she is unsure of how to handle it. She has never had a relationship before and whats worse Matt not only attended the camp with her when she was younger, he was also her first kiss! will Kate be able to stay strong in her faith or will Matt be able to get the girl and get under Kates skin? Your truth isnt everybody elses truth. Your beliefs matter right? he asks. I really found Kate to be quite naive. She assumed that just because she was going to church camp that everyone there had the same beliefs that she does. What she found when she got there was counselors who cursed and met each other behind the cafeteria for a little fun. Maybe if she talked to me before signing up to be a counselor I could have let her in on what really goes on at camp. Throughout this book Kate has this inner fight with herself going on. Should I? Shouldnt I? There are many times that Kates faith is tested and not just in regards to Matt and her feelings for him. When she first arrives at camp she is paired up as co counselor with Brad, or as he likes to call himself Bumble Bee Brad. While swimming Kate notices that Brad wheres a shirt despite having an amazing six pack of abs that she can see. She also notices some marks on his arms. Once Brad finally tells Kate his story she is torn with what she should do. Lie and sin? Or keep her friends secret and possibly save him from what he is going through? I think this is one of the friendships I liked most in this book. Even though we dont see a ton from Brad I think this friendship and the fact that she could really be there for him helped Kate see that sinning isnt always a bad thing when it is helping someone. Kate is an amazing artist and it something that she truly loves. She uses her art almost like a diary throughout the book, sketching different scenes that have taken place in her life and mean something to her. Anytime Kate tells us something that happened in the past it is always through her sketches. I really liked this idea and thought it was a very creative alternative to a traditional diary. Kates sketches are how she gets her feelings out. While this book does talk a lot about religion, I really feel that people who are nonreligious will be able to enjoy it as well. I did find myself getting frustrated with Kate at times and just wanting her to relax and not take everything so seriously. I felt like she needed to stray from that fine line she was walking and take a little stroll on the wild side. Miranda Kenneally really knows how to show a characters personal growth in her writing While Kate did not grown by leaps and bounds she did show personal growth which I loved to see for her. For the first time ever, Im beginning to feel like something someoneis more important than anything. The love interest in this book, Matt, is nothing short of amazing. He is sweet, caring and understanding. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about Matt is that he plays the guitar, sings and writes his own lyrics. What is not to like about that? Like Kate, Matt has a past as well. He is a broken man who has gone through a tough break up and it is hard for him to trust. Kate and Matt have some very romantic moments that just make you swoon completely. Plain and simple Matt is every girls dream. He is most definitely my favorite character from Kenneallys books so far. My favorite is when an eightyearold girl named Lizzie sings Jesus loves Me in the purest voice, and when she gets scared and I think she might run off the stage, Matt sings along with her as he strums his guitar. Leaning against a tree, as bugs chirp around me, as warm wind rustles the branches, thats when I know it for real. I want him. We also get to see some more of Parker and Will in this book. I fell in love with these two in Stealing Parker. Jordan from Catching Jordan also makes an appearance. If you have not read these two books you should really get on that and then when you are done pick up Things I Cant Forget. You will not regret it. This is one that will be taken off my self and reread many times to come. Happy reading.
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE REVIEWS AT READING, EATING AND DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF Beg For Mercy is the first novel in Shannon Dermotts new young adult paranormal series. This novel is about Mercy, a girl who is half human and half succubus AKA: soulsucking demon. With just one kiss Mercy can drain the life of a human boy, too bad she has no clue how to control her gift or her hormones. To be completely honest, this novel made me want to bang my head against the wall. It wasnt a bad novel; it was just extremely frustrating. Mercy likes, loves, lusts after every single boy she meets. Mercy gives new meaning to the term BOY CRAZY. She wants to jump every single guy she meets. Here is an example of Mercys behavior It is a spoiler, but I put it in code. I say things that happen, but I dont mention any of the guys names. I also dont list anything about the conclusion.: Mercy has spent the last two years loving A. Then she kisses B. Then C becomes her boyfriend. Then she kisses C. Then she kisses A. Eventually she kisses B too. Then she meets and flirts with D, and she really wants to kiss him too. Then she flirts with E  F. Then she really flirts with G, and she really thinks about kissing G. At one point she even runs off with G, while she is dating C. Then she kisses B and C, and I think D too. I am not positive that I got ALL the details right, but that is the gist of things. What The Heck. Mercy, here is a little advice: You should NOT have a boyfriend if 1 you could kill him by kissing him 2 you crush on every guy you meet 3 you want to kiss every guy you meet 4 you actually kiss every other guy you meet 5 you think you are in love with another guy. Mercy talks a lot about love. Mercy knows nothing about love. NO ONE TELLS MERCY ANYTHING!!! This entire novel is based on everyones lack of communication. If you have read my reviews, then you know that this drives me nuts. The entire time I was reading this novel I kept thinking, OMG! Will someone please just tell the poor girl what the heck is going on? Mercy deserves to know what she is, what she can do, how to protect herself, and how to protect other people. What kind of mother tells her child she is a demon and then refuses to share any other information with her? Her mother isnt the only one who knows what it is going on either. Out of the six million guys in Mercys life, a few of them know what is going on too. Why dont they tell her? Mercy doesnt ask or demand to know what is going on Why doesnt Mercy make a bigger effort to find out about herself? She could try and talk to her mother. If I were in her shoes, I would demand answers. I would ask questions every single day. I wouldnt let it go until I got answers. Then, she finally meets someone else like her, but she doesnt push him for answers either. She asks him for help now and then, but she doesnt demand an explanation. Then, sketchy things start happening around her. She can tell that people are hiding things from her, but she still doesnt demand answers. She says she wants to know, but she doesnt DO anything about it. Mercy and her vocab words During the course of this novel, Mercy is preparing for the SATS. She incorporates advanced vocabulary words into her everyday conversations to practice for the vocabulary portion of the test. At first, I thought this was original and really neat I am sure Mercy would have a much better word for neat. However, it started to really get on my nerves toward the end of the novel. Random supernatural beings As if things werent already crazy enough, Dermott adds other random supernatural beings into the mix. However, they were never really tied into the novel. They exist, but I dont really understand their role. I felt like they could have just been left out completely, but maybe Dermott was just setting up the sequel. Who knows? Mercys demon Shannon Dermott should have given Mercys demon a voice earlier on in the novel. I think it would have helped me understand Mercy and her urges better. Mercy would make remarks like, The succubus wanted nothing more than to jump the guy that sat next to me or A kiss, my subconscious told me. I needed to kiss someone soon. This novel would have been a lot more enjoyable and easier to read if Dermott would have given the succubus a voice in the beginning. For example, Jump HIM!! or Kiss him. You know youre dying to kiss him. You need to kiss him. This would have added humor, helped the novel flow better, and helped us better understand Mercys demon. Toward the end of the novel, Dermott does give a voice to the succubus. It wasnt exactly what I was hoping for, but it was a voice, nonetheless. I just think that if this had happened earlier on, I think I would have understood Mercy better. I gave Beg For Mercy by Shannon Dermott 3 STARS 2.5 STARS. The majority of the reviews for this novel fall between 4 and 5 STARS. The majority of people have really, really enjoyed this novel. It just didnt really do it for me. I dont want to discourage anyone from reading this novel. If you have this novel on your wish list, read it and let me know what you think. XOXO READING, EATING AND DREAMING
Achingly real. Deeply Affecting. Emotionally Turbulent. A story about friendship and loyalty, suppressing feelings and relinquishing to feelings... about desire that burns and a love that consumes... about the magic of music and the enduring hope of maybe someday. Another unforgettable experience from Colleen Hoover. 6 stars!!! There are only twentysix letters in the English alphabet. You would think there would only be so much you could do with twentysix letters. You would think there were only so many ways those letters could make you feel when mixed up and shoved together to make words. However, there are infinite ways those twentysix letters can make a person feel... And this story is living proof. I use the authors own words to describe my own experience. How is it possible to make simple words incite so much emotion? Make me feel so much? Within the span of these 320 pages, I felt betrayal. Anger. Hope. Confusion. Desire. Love. I was moved to tears. And at times, I was honestly scared. Colleen Hoover puts us in some uncomfortable spots, making me uncertain on how I would feel in the end. Would I be happy? Was there a true right and wrong? Does that even exist when love fuels the choices we make? The pages of this story were brimming with feeling... often times stirring up a fury of emotion that crushed me and antagonized me, while at the same time thrilled me with the reverie of the kind of love that consumes... that finally breathes relief upon meeting its soul mate. And in addition to a beautifully crafted narrative, its power is intensified with the richness of another dimension. The story roared to life through the voice of Griffin Peterson. I felt every word. Every moment. And if it werent already certain, Colleen Hoover has once again proven herself to be a master storyteller, weaving a story with words that are deceptively simple and characters that are nothing less than unforgettable. Are you in the mood to make beautiful music together? Sydney Blake is content. Shes got a great boyfriend, a great roommate, a great job and a growing love of music. Despite some disappointing parents and a pestering hesitation at taking her relationship to the next level, life is good. In addition, shes found some unexpected joy listening to a talented and mysterious neighbor who plays his guitar each night. Sounds curling across the courtyard to ignite her passion. Melodies to inspire her. Lyrics unleashed to paper. But everything falls apart on her twentysecond birthday when she realizes her boyfriend and best friend are having an affair. Luckily fate intervenes and she finds herself thrust closer to her captivating neighbor. I never expected my twentysecond birthday to end with me showering in a strange apartment and sleeping on a couch that belongs to a guy Ive barely known for two weeks, all at the hands of the two people I cared about and trusted the most. Heartbroken and homeless, Sydney finds comfort in her time with Ridge, all the while learning the depth of his talents despite some irremediable impediments. When Ridge makes a hardtorefuse proposition, they begin to write music together. Her words, his melody, side by side, night by night as their lives begin to entwine. Each set of lyrics becoming more personal as a connection between them forms, grows and intensifies... pulling them together. Closer. Theres something about these moments when were writing music that I absolutely love. All my worries and thoughts about everything wrong in my life seem to go away for the short times we write together. I really loved both of them individually. One of the aspects I love most about this authors characters is that they always have such big, altruistic hearts. Sydney is so selfless and good. Shes witty and talented and before too long, she finds herself falling for Ridge. Ridge is incredibly talented. Hes a survivor... a surprisingly good and healthy outcome of a childhood marred by ugliness, alcoholism and hate. Hes loyal to a fault with an unfailing drive to protect others. With Sydney, however, he finds a very real connection, an ease, a magic... an intense need to be with her. Despite how hard we tried to fight it, all of those things happened between us because our feelings for each other are becoming so much stronger than our desire. Desire is easy to fight. Especially when the only weapon desire possesses is attraction. Its not so easy when youre trying to win a war against the heart. There are truths, however, circumstances that cannot be denied that push them apart. For the good of others, they must squash, bury and forget their feelings for each other. And as a reader, my heart broke for the rightness of their togetherness, but I simultaneously felt conflicted by the goodness of their intentions given the impossible situation. In my opening thoughts, I said that the story was emotionally turbulent and what I meant by that is that I felt so many feelings at war within me as the scenes unfurled on the pages. Lines are drawn, but then they fade. For her I bend, for you I break. As they both battle their emotions, the power to deny them becomes impossible and the socalled lines they drawn blur as their actions become instinctive...a need for relief more powerful than their good intentions. The story, which is told through an alternating Ridge and Sydney pointofview does an amazing job at helping us to understand their thoughts and feelings, deepening the connection I had with them as characters, so when reality brutally severs hope, I was shattered. I did have a little hope. Although I wasnt ready for anything right now, I thought the possibility would be there. I assumed that maybe someday, when I was ready, things could have developed between us. However... I realize there cant be a maybe someday between us. There will never be a maybe someday. As the story comes to its natural climax I honestly thought... heck, here it is... one of my favorite authors may finally falter. The looming end seemed too murky and unresolved. But its her adept skill at taking us to uncomfortable places, having us wallow in the throes of uncertainty, then somehow ordering things in a way where the impossible becomes possible and the unrightable finally feels right, well it makes the payoff all the sweeter, all the more powerful. This book was just beautiful and real and everything I hope to experience upon the first flip of any storys page. Furthermore, the added richness of the music made it all feel so alive. Special. Intimate. I love the fact that this author continues to push herself in each of her books. That even at the top of her game, I continue to see growth and innovation with each new release. Whether it be a novel way to format chapters to maximize impact or in this case, adding an unexpected dimension to heighten emotion, Colleen Hoover has simply become one of the most exciting authors to read. I anxiously await her next book, Ugly Love later this year. For more reviews, connect with me: Vilmas Book Blog  Facebook  Twitter
Somewhere in England a madman, hellbent on revenge, is watching, waiting, biding his time and building his armies. In hiding, he anticipates their every move. Always just one step ahead. Pulling the strings. Calling the shots. He has a plan. He set a trap. And all he has to do is wait. But his patience is not infinite. And time is running out... ... for Charlotte to track him down and prove to everyone once and for all that shes capable of running the Institute. ... for Tessa to find answers about where she comes from and who she really is, so she can discover where she truly belongs. ... for Will to break free from the demons of his past and to reveal his secrets before he loses everything. ... for Jem to find a cure before its too late for him to find happiness and to give his heart to someone he loves.  Clockwork Prince is the highly anticipated, incredibly imaginative, enthralling and heartbreaking sequel to Clockwork Angel in Cassandra Clares The Infernal Devices series. The prologue will immediately draw readers back into the authors richly developed and magical world of Shadow Hunters, Downworlders and Mundanes. Returning them to a Victorian London that keeps its secrets hidden amidst the shadows of its crowded and sootcovered alleyways. Leadership of the Institute is being called into question and Charlotte will have to prove to Consul Wayland and the rest of the Clave that she should continue to run it. The Magister remains on the loose, plotting his revenge and waiting for just the right time to send in his clockwork army. Tessa is still desperate for answers to questions that it seems only the Magister knows. And Will is struggling to keep his secrets, the burden of which is becoming almost too much to bear. In this suspenseful and gripping story, every answer only seems to lead to more questions. Every chapter offers a new surprise. And as more and more secrets are revealed, discoveries are made, hidden motivations are uncovered and a shocking betrayal comes to light, readers will be left stunned and heartbroken and anxious for more. Cassandra Clares writing has such a beautiful cadence and flow. It allows readers to easily get pulled into her stories, and Clockwork Prince is no exception. And while it may appear to be lengthy, at approximately five hundred pages, it is a surprisingly quick and immensely enjoyable read. While the world she creates in this series is very different from the one in The Mortal Instruments, the elements that are the same really connect the two  from a shared history and common ancestors to characters who survive the passage of time to appear in both series. And from the Shadow Hunters to the Silent Brothers, from the Clave to the Institutes, both series have a foundation that is exceptionally detailed, incredibly exciting and much beloved to fans. Her characters in Clockwork Prince are easily as lovable as those in her other series, if not more so. Tessa is beautiful, brave, loyal, kindhearted, intelligent and inquisitive. Jem is handsome, patient, trustworthy, fiercely loyal and incredibly easygoing. Magnus is just as charming and funny and endearing as he is over a century later in The Mortal Instruments. And then theres Will. Will is complicated. Hes temperamental, sarcastic, startlingly goodlooking, irresistibly sexy, mysterious, secretive, fiercely loyal to his parabatai Jem, at times incredibly cruel and at others unbelievably kind. Without a doubt, Clockwork Prince is a must read that will engage readers and instantly transport them back in time to this story set in the Victorian Era that is a wonderful mix of paranormal, steampunk, action, mystery and suspense, and has at its heart a love story. On a personal note: What an amazing and heartbreaking book this was. I cant believe I have to wait for an entire year to get my hands on Clockwork Princess. Because, not only do I want to know what happens next, I really want to know who the clockwork princess is! There are just so many questions that are left unanswered at the end of Clockwork Prince. So many different directions this story can take. I do not have a single clue  not one  about where the author plans on going. And its killing me. Just killing me. Sure, this may not be considered a book with a cliffhanger ending, or at least not one that leaves you totally suspended in midair. But even if Im not left hanging, a lot of things are. Or if not hanging, then certainly openended. With way too many possibilities for things to go wrong... or even more wrong than they already have. And not many of these possibilities seem like theyll have happy endings, or at least endings Ill be happy with. But I definitely remain hopeful. I mean, just look at Clary and Jace in City of Glass. I love, love, love, love, love just how much Will there is in this story. And Magnus, though I could always use more Magnus. While I am a huge Jem fan, I tend to lean toward the bad boy or at least the supersarcastic boy who pretends not to care about anyone or anything, but sorta does. I refuse to be spoilery so I will try not to talk too much about any of the characters, but so much happens with them in this story. And while it doesnt always feel like a lot is going on, a lot is actually going on. There is less of an emphasis on the steampunk aspects in this book, but theyre not left out entirely. And there is a reason why they take a back seat and thats because a large part of this story is on certain other characters who have been keeping secrets. I really can say no more. Tessa is just as lovable as I remembered her from the first book in the series. Shes a book lover  which already makes her a favorite  and shes clever and so goodhearted. But she does show another side to her personality in this book. One that makes me like her even more. Ive always been a huge Jem fan, though Will is still my number one. And the author shows a lot more of the yumminess of Jem in this book, which makes the choice between the two boys a little more difficult. But Will.... Oh Will. There is just so much Id love to say about Will right about now. If I only could.... I will just say that he is definitely in this book. A lot. Which made me a very, very happy girl... mostly.... And that he is just as maddeningly and infuriatingly sexy as ever. And yes, I was devastated about certain turns of events. The author took my heart and crushed it and I dont know quite how Ill recover. And I just cant see how it can be repaired in the next book. Maybe Ill need a clockwork one. I think I preordered every single version of this book. I dont want to miss out on any of the extras that come with it. And I am hoping theyll reveal just a little more about what I can anticipate in Clockwork Princess which seems just so very far away right now. I am such a huge fan of both series and after reading Clockwork Prince, I think I might love them equally. Cassandra Clares writing is always magical and the worlds she creates are so elaborate and captivating and exciting, and they make me want to get lost in them again and again. Fortunately City of Lost Souls will be out in May to help break up the long, long wait for the next book in The Infernal Devices series. And so the countdown begins....
4.5 stars For anyone who, as it happened to me, is having trouble getting into this book  stick with it! I promise it gets much, much better! Lilac LaRoux is the daughter of the richest man in the known universe, Tarver Merendsen is a lower class young man who, due to his feats in the battlefield, was quickly promoted to major, thus outranking most of the officers on the luxury spaceliner in which Lilac and Tarver are travelling. Something goes wrong with the spaceliner and, after getting into an escape pod, Lilac and Tarver crash into a strange planet. Its not just about surviving in the wilderness and trying to flag a spaceship to rescue them  its about cracking the mystery of the whispers that haunt them in this new planet. I didnt really like the way this book started, this book could have been worthy of 5 stars, but the start... I read many complaints about finding Lilac unlikable at first, I didnt have that problem, my problem is that the beginning of the book makes the characters sound like a standard YA MarySue and GaryStue. Get this: Lilac is a gorgeous redhead, rich, famous, and among a sea of flawlessly gorgeous women she stands out. Not only that, shes a genius in electronics, explosives, and space travel. Tarver is only 18 years old but he is so amazing that, even in an extremely classist society, he managed to be promoted above all the rich people in the military and now outranks everyone on the spaceship. Not only that he is also super handsome and fit, and he is now famous for his battle heroics. I mean... really? But I urge readers to ignore this inauspicious start. The story is well worth it. First of all, hurray for a healthy relationship in YA!! The guy is so normal! Yeah, he still notices and thinks about sex, but he respects her and, thinking his advances will not be welcome, does not attempt anything. Which, given the circumstances would have been a bit iffy  I mean, theyre stranded in a strange planet, she depends on him for survival... The romance part of the book was masterfully dealt with. Lilac had a say in all of it, the matter of consent was very present in all their romantic interactions. Plus it wasnt a case of instalove; they started off on the wrong foot and learned to trust and eventually like each other. It was a gradual and realistic buildup, especially considering their circumstances. The story is told in alternating POVs, we get Lilac, we get Tarver, and we get glimpses of Tarvers interrogation after their rescue, which help frame the chapters that follow them and keep the reader guessing as to what actually happened until the very end. I really liked both characters despite their unrealistic achievements. They were both so likable that I, a notoriously picky reader, managed to just go, Yeah... Ill just ignore it because aww look at them! I loved Lilac. She crashes into a planet while wearing a ball gown and high heels and not once complains about trekking through the wilderness. She tries to keep up with Tarver no matter what, even if its clear hed be willing to give her a break, because as she puts it: ... years later, when he looks back at this escapade, Id rather he think bitch than weakling. Yes! Girl, tell it!!! She is not, despite her introduction, a MarySue in the way she behaves throughout the book. She recognises her failings, she knows her limits, she also knows when not to back down. And she was never tstl. Do you know how refreshing it is to read a YA female protagonist like that? Tarver is also great. Instead of being the usual manipulative, controlling asshole that populates most YA, New Adult and Contemporary Romance books, hes gasp a normal guy, who thinks of Lilac as an equal human being  just one he happens to be attracted to, but given everything, that is hardly of importance, not when theyre struggling to survive. He understands that Lilacs need for independence is not just a feminine whim hell condescendingly indulge or not, as many male characters in his place would have seen it  but a core element of her selfworth and ability to keep going in a dreadful situation. He was very capable and, inarguably, the one most at ease in their environment, but he never took that as meaning he was the one in charge. The great thing about Lilac and Tarvers relationship was the mutual respect and the slow build of trust between them. They asked multiple times throughout the book for the other ones trust and that was the basis for their whole relationship. That is so awesome! This is not just a survival tale, there is a mystery to be cracked in this planet: whispers and visions haunt them through their trek. Things happen that make them doubt their sanity. There is something... someone there with them. But who or what could it be? Not going to spoil it, of course, but I have to say that readers should prepare themselves for some tearjerking moments that come out of nowhere and punch them in the gut, then leave them sobbing and gasping while contemplating the nature of self and what makes a person who they are, and how consciousness and selfawareness may not be enough to make you real. Basically a Descartes beatdown, but its the reader that ends up curled into a ball, crying. I honestly cannot wait to get my hands on the next book  even though I already know it wont be about Lilac and Tarvers, though hopefully theyll make an appearance, or at the very least will be mentioned in it. But I trust Amie Kaufman and Maegan Spooner to write a wonderful book  all my respect to them: two authors writing a book and it reads absolutely seamlessly, and they wrote an incredibly engaging plot with a healthy relationship within it. Really, really well done! Anyway, I dont know how convincing I managed to be, since my aim is to get everyone to read this book, so just in case I wasnt very successful: PLEASE GO READ THIS BOOK! I promise youll love it!
How can it be possible to summarize an entire year in books? I have no idea how such a thing can be successfully done, so I am just going to stick to spontaneously collecting my own thoughts regarding this year which is not even over yet  and still I am going to write this review now because I doubt that too much will change during the upcoming weeks, except that I may lose my motivation to write this. 2016 has been a pretty good year for me on many personal levels, but also in reference to books. Just a year ago, if anyone had asked me what I think about specific genres, I would have been at a loss of words to explain my reading interests. This year I explored the value of nonfiction books, discovered some new favorite authors Tana French, Richard Russo and Oscar Wilde come to mind and a lot of favorite books in case you are interested to hear which books I am talking about, youll find a list at the end of this review rambling. As of today, nineteen days before the end of the year, I have read a total number of 115 books and quite a number of short stories. If you look at my shelves, you may notice that almost all of these books have been read before the end of August and that since then there are huge gaps in my reading statistics. The explanation is just as simple: I have been reading too much. Following my attempt to catch up with all the books I thought I had missed to read in previous years proved to be the wrong idea; resulting in many weeks during which I hardly read anything at all. What I learned by this and can only recommend to others: You should never read just for the sake of reading as much as possible. Instead, in most cases you should read for the sake of enjoying what youre reading or learning something from these books. When I wrote my review for 2015 on Goodreads about a year ago, my plans were to read more of George Orwell I didnt, Edgar Allan Poe I didnt and Arthur Conan Doyle surprise: I didnt, but also more of Stephen King I ended up reading too much by him and more classics which I actually think worked out. My plans also included finishing the Harry Potter books only the last book still stands between me and reaching this goal, reading Lord of the Rings I didnt, finishing the Chronicles of Narnia I didnt and buying less books instead I bought more. The lesson taught by this: I shouldnt attempt to plan my reading years anymore. And yet this didnt keep me from creating a list of books I intend to read next year, even though there are still about twenty unread books sitting on my shelf of books I wanted to read this year. My intention for next year is to focus my attention on some classics I started to read, actually really liked and yet ended up abandoning at some point of this years August Pride  Prejudice, The Secret Garden, East of Eden. But that was enough about my personal year in books. Goodreads would be nothing without its users, and they are who I want to thank today because I met so many great friends on here. Thank you to everyone for being here and for making Goodreads a little bit richer with your presence. And I almost forgot that I wanted to point out some of my favorite books of this year. If you are still interested, you may want to check out the following novels links lead to my reviews: 1. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: We Should All Be Feminists: This is not even a recommendation, this is a mustread. Adichies take on the subject of feminism should be widely regarded as something to live according to, or at least as a viewpoint which receives more appreciation from society. 2. Jeff Zentner: The Serpent King: Zentners debut novel was easily one of the best surprises of the year for me personally, delivering a heartbreaking and tremendously underrated comingofage tale. 3. John Williams: Butchers Crossing: After reading and loving Williams Stoner in 2015 already, his second novel proved to be an equally excellent masterpiece. Just like The Serpent King, this book deserves way more attention from readers all over the world, with its timeless story telling, emotionally touching themes and interesting characters. 4. Leo Tolstoy: The Death of Ivan Ilych: One of my first adventures inside the genre of Russian classic literature, Tolstoys famous short story was capable of touching me on a very personal level, something I wouldnt have expected from a Russian classic. If you are like me and also try to shy away from the big Russian classics like Anna Karenina, War and Peace or Dostoyevskys Crime and Punishment, then maybe this short story would be perfect for you as well. 5. Paul Kalanithi: When Breath Becomes Air: One of 2016s most celebrated autobiographical novels, Kalanithis memoir was capable of providing a lot of food for thought and a new viewpoint on the horrible subject of cancer. Everyone of you should read this one. 6. S.E. Hinton: The Outsiders: Hintons classic novel, written at the age of 16, is as amazing as it is short. There is no need to lose any words about this one: you should read it. I chose not to point out some other amazing books which basically everybody already knows about, for example Jane Eyre, Harry Potter, The Green Mile, Frankenstein, The Picture of Dorian Gray or Hamlet. But one book shouldnt be forgotten: Empire Falls by Richard Russo. Im taking months to read this dont ask, its a weird combination of not wanting to finish it too soon and wanting to rush through it at the same time, resulting in me not even picking it up for weeks, but I cant recommend it highly enough. And for everyone interested in my reading statistics according to the Goodreads feature: So, to sum things up, I read about 10,000 pages more than I did last year, with my average rating remaining exactly the same. Today I also managed to surpass my goal which I set for my reading challenge 170 books by finishing The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom. Im looking forward to many books in 2017, but even more to many interesting exchanges and reviews here on Goodreads. Cheers to 2017!
Full review: Stalk Me by Jillian Dodd 4 Stars!! Damn Disney, and all their happilyeverafter, unrealistic, bullshit stories. This is my first Jillian Dodd book and so I was going into the unknown not knowing what to expect. I have loved reliving my youth through teen stories so I knew that this would be one of those reads where I could drift back to my school years, which incidentally were far from pretty to a life of teen loves, romance, melodramas and all that goes with it and I was not disappointed! Firstly I would just like to say I love Jillians style of writing, it is fun and it is flirty and it pulls you in, you cannot help but immerse yourself into Keatyns life and feel like you are living it with her. Whilst I was reading this, it sort of reminded me of a programme I used to watch when I was a teenager....many moons ago called Beverley Hills 90210. I had a soft spot for Jason Priestly!! Dont judge me!! And I couldnt stand Shannen Doherty!! Bet you are all thinking...WHO?? Well I am sure there must be some old clips on YouTube! Keatyn has a privileged life, her mother is a very talented actress called Abby Johnston and her father Tommy Stevens is a Hollywood legend. She has wardrobes full of designer clothes and shoes, she is Miss Popular at school, boys are queuing up to be her boyfriend and of course all this brings with it jealousy and contempt. When she was little, Keatyn had written what she perceived to be the perfect life script she had written her own movie of how she wanted her life to pan out. Obviously, things always go off course, but Keatyn is adamant that if she tries hard enough she can get her life back on track so that she can fulfil her ideal dream life. Following Keatyns life at school there is a lot of drama thrown in, arguments, boy trouble and a stalker issue. This book though is more about Keatyn finding herself, it is through all the trials and tribulations of trying to be Miss Popular that she realises that actually it is not all it is cracked up to be and perhaps, just this once she needs to change. She does not like the person that she is becoming and doesnt want to morph into the bitchy friends that she has gained whilst at school. Eventually the stalker issue forces her life course to take a dramatic turn and maybe this is the change that she needs to find herself and become that person that she has always deep down wanted to be. This book is full of hot boys too so you have some drool worthy dudes to get hot over, firstly I will mention Sanders, he is your typical high school popular kid, on the outside, he was sweet and charming but you always felt that he was hiding something, is he all what he seems? After agreeing to breakup and remain firm friends Sander and Keatyn cracked me up after Sander got the lead role in Grease  Good. You know what though? Ive never had a role where I got my heart broken. In Grease, Sandy breaks my heart. Do you mind if I use our breakup as practice? Like, Ill act all devastated at school. Ill be all dreary and full of angst. Then comes the Cushman Mr Cocky!! He was good looking and he knew it, used it to his advantage and then some, his chat up lines were hilarious but you couldnt help but fall in love with him. He was super cute! He also had a huge soft spot for Keatyn. Youre single. Im single. Lets mingle. Then we have Brooklyn, typical surfer dude but he was also very deep and meaningful at times. He would recite Keats for his Keats and this did make him fairly loveable, but he was so laid back her was virtually horizontal and I always felt that he was holding back. He was Keatyns first true love and she sort of hero worships him but I feel that he is just leading her on. He has his ambitions and their lifestyles are so different I think he feels he would never fit in. He feels that Keatyn is too material and this does not fit in with his aspirations. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Its Keats for my Keats. I will save the best till last....sigh!! Aiden Arrington The God of All Hotties yes he really is that hot...my heart melted as did my brain. His nickname for Keatyn was super cute and I feel that he has a very real connection with his Boots, I can see them as soul mates, lovers and hopefully married with lots of babies. I cant wait to see where their relationship takes us going forward. I really hope they get together as I can see some hot, hot, hot panty melting scenes between these two. I just fell hopelessly and deeply in love with this guy...he really is that dreamy! We have 6 books though so I am sure that a lot is going to happen inbetween, but I am keeping my fingers crossed for these two. He should be down on his knees begging me to marry him and have his little Hottie babies. Keatyn...what can I say about the star of this book, well she can be frustrating, sometimes I wanted to give her a slap, but you felt her inner turmoil, you could see she was just trying to conform to the in crowd and you ended up cheering her on to do what was right for herself. She has some serious problems going on at the moment and that is a lot for anyone to deal with and I cant wait to see her develop going forward. I think it was Betsey Johnson that said women dress for other women. If we dressed for men, wed all run around naked. Jillian Dodd, I absolutely loved this book, I cannot wait for the next and the next and the next. I am itching to see how Keatyn changes and grows, this is really going to be one of those series that every teenager should read, they will be able to associate with Keatyns life so much and would probably pick up some amazing tips along the way. Jillian really has managed to encapsulate the teen drama and all that goes with growing up, I cannot wait to see Keatyns own metamorphisis.
This review can also be found on A Thousand Lives Lived, check it out for more! 4.5 star rating This four point five star rating I am handing Heidi Heiligs debut timetraveling adventure romance add in whatever genre you can think of and this book has it is not exactly what it seems like. Honestly? Forget about that four point five and picture this book as a perfect ten. The Girl From Everywhere was mystical, dashing, magical, stunning and just ohsogood, unlike my initial expectations. PEOPLE. I find that its better to expect the worst than the best, even in reality. I initially expected a boring, ununderstandable read for me with this one, but I flew through it in a sitting, and after it was over, I picked up my library copy and held it against my heart. I get a little cheesy when I like a book so much. Oh, and why should you treat this as a perfect rating? Because the book was practically perfect. I will touch on a minor thing that set me off from granting this five stars, but it barely affected me in any manner. By the way, I just noticed the girl in the water on the cover of this book after reading. I LOVE THOSE SURPRISES. Thats megacool. The Girl From Everywhere has such a perfect title for the 443 pages that are stamped inside of this beautiful cover. It explains our heroine, Nix, so well. Im so giddy with this book that I dont even know where my review should really begin. This is definitely one of the best books Ive read this year, and perhaps ever. I cannot fangirl about it more than I already have and will. For some reason, I expected this to be bad. Why? Because in the past, I have never enjoyed books about timetraveling mixed with historical events and myths. Okay, first of all, myths are rarely incorporated into YA these days, so thats a first... or second. Heidi Heilig writes about something thats deep in her heart, and I bet that she is seriously passionate about: Hawaiian culture. HOLY LEIS AND PINEAPPLES. I love Hawaii, I want to go there so bad. I mean, I always wanted to fly to the island of Oahu, be leied or whatever they call it, yell Ohana means family and say Aloha to every person I meet there. But now? This book introduced Hawaiian culture to me and it was so interesting to read about the most gorgeous islands in the world... back in the day, specifically in the nineteenth century. HOW DOES HEIDI DO EVERYTHING PERFECTLY? Theres so much diversity in The Girl From Everywhere that I cannot stop squealing. We have Kashmir HOLY I LOVE HIM, ILL GET TO HIM SOON, who is from Persia when Nix and her father, Slate, find him, and theres also Bee, who is African. Bees a crew member on The Temptation, the ship that Nix and her father timetravel or Navigate with. Shes lesbian too, which shows us how DEDICATED this book is. I loved reading about each and every place that Nix Navigated to, including New York City and how she retold events from the past when they went to Scandia and how they saw dragons in the Baltic Sea. It was only the nervous shifting of his eyes that hinted at discomfort, but not with the city, nor with being on land. With his own skin. No matter where we went, he never felt at home. I recognized that feeling. Id inherited it 35. Basically, The Girl From Everywhere is about our heroine, Nix, whose mother died when she gave birth to her. Her father, who is the captain of the ship that they, among others, timetravel, or Navigate with, called The Temptation, has never gotten over the fact that his true love is gone. He and Nix travel through time using maps that they find, going back centuries or millenniums into the past. Now, they are on the search for Nixs mother back in the past in Honolulu, Hawaii. That scares Nix, because she knows that she could possibly disappear if they do find her. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole novel. Although its about five hundred pages long, I couldnt stop reading from the moment I began the story. Heidi Heilig writes so casually, yet absolutely lyrically and different, perhaps more poetic than I wouldve expected. I loved everything about this story, how it teaches readers about culture, myth and the beautiful parts of loving life. I wish that I could GRAB ALL OF THE MAPS AND NAVIGATE MYSELF. Its a different twist on timetravel, and its for a good reason. You see, I always need some kind of description of the gears of timetraveling in a book I read. Thats so important for me. Heilig did not infodump on us, making up some weird explanations for why what Nix and her father do works. It was brief, yet unimaginable because no author has ever explored a bookish world like Heidi had. I dont understand the issues people had with this glorious story. It was racing, perfectly paced, and now? My life depends on the sequel. Honestly, a sequel isnt needed because the story ended off perfectly and we readers could imagine a continuing ending that works, but THERE IS ONE COMING AND DAMN, I NEED IT. I NEED HARPERCOLLINS TO SEND ME A COPY ASAP. ILL TAKE A MANUSCRIPT THATS ALL WRITTEN OVER, IF THATS WHAT IT TAKES. Or, I could ask my favourite couple, Nix and Kashmir, to personally deliver it. twiddles eyebrows Nix is your dream definition of a heroine. I loved her personality, and how she dealt with the situation she was in. She had every right to be confused and feel discomfort with her life, because she was taken away from what was supposed to be her future. It was interesting for us to get a firsthand look at the life she wouldve had if her father hadnt began Navigating for Nixs mother in the past, in nineteenth century Hawaii. She wasnt one of those protagonists who hated everyone around her for unexplainable reasons, you know? I found myself totally relating to her wanderlust, and NOW I WANT TO TRAVEL. People with severe wanderlust, this book is for you to take a trip with. Paradise is a promise no god bothers to keep. Theres only now, and tomorrow nothing will be the same, whether we like it or not 390. KASHMIR AND BLAKE. Guys, we have a slight love triangle here, but unless youre really affected by them, youll be fine. Blake is a character we are introduced to halfway through the novel, and he is living in the Hawaii that Nix visits with The Temptation. He hides this secret that he is also a mapmaker, and Nix is immediately drawn to his mysteriousness. I would be, too. I loved Blake and his mysterious character, but honestly? My heart is for the gorgeous Kashmir. Kashmir is Nixs best friend, and they have known each other for a long time. He is also a thief, and helps Nixs father to all of the deeds that Nix herself would never want to do. AGH. My heart flutters like hell when hes in a chapter. I need them to be together. Shes kind of torn between the two, and I wonder how the next book will patch things up. AND GUYS. THE ENDING? Nix is well... SPOILER stuck with them both. Hah. SPOILER ENDS So what I had a slight issue with was the ending itself. That was just chaotic and I found that it happened so fast that I didnt know what exactly happened. I still dont even know. I dont know how Nixs father made the decision that he did, and I had to go over the last chapter or so a few times, but it still was foggy. I need a greater explanation, PLEASE. But thats cool, fine. I LOVE THIS BOOK, OH EM GEE. The Girl From Everywhere is one of the most stunning debuts I have ever read. WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ROMANCE who cares about the love triangle? It works!, a heroine who is one of a kind, and a plot slash story that I cannot get out of my head. This book seems like a dream, I cant believe I was so fortunate to read it, because its unlike anything that my brain would ever come up with in a million years. Who knows? Maybe I could Navigate into 2017 and grab a copy from the amazing Heidi herself. THAT WOULD BE THE BEST.
Left Drowning by Jessica Park 5 ugly crying, puffy eyed, nose running inducing stars!! OMG OMG OMG, I have to write this straight away whilst I am emotionally distraught, I cannot convey how much I cried whilst reading this book...I should really post a picture of the mess of a face I was left with but I wouldnt want to scare you all away, but I was a total and utter wreck. I am an emotional person anyways and I do cry fairly easily, but this was embarrassing. It wasnt even as if the event that triggered this total and utter sob fest was that bad but I was so pulled into this story emotionally and mentally it felt like my own heart was breaking, no scratch that, it was ripped out, stamped out, stabbed a few times and tossed in the trash. Jessica Park, you killed me.....I am distraught, I have run out of tissues and my husband thinks I am an utter fruit loop, but other than that I am OK, just. This book pulls you in from the dedication: For Tommy, who is and will always be, my Sabin. This book is for everyone who has survived. You are not broken. You can love and be loved, depite what may feel like the eternally brutal nature of the world. Even when youre drowning and so far under, there is always time to reach for someone who will teach you how to breathe again. I was not sure what to expect when I started reading this, after reading Flat Out Love and Flat Out Matt I was thinking it would be another one of those quirky books that suits Jessicas personality to a T, we have seen her wicked sense of humour all over Facebook, she cracks me up daily but this was sooooo different. This book was deep, meaningful, emotional, beautifully written and most of all captivating, I could not put it down. Blythe, beautiful, brilliant, Blythe, she was still grieving for a lot of things, the loss of her parents four years earlier and also the loss of her relationship with her brother. That tragic night had destroyed everything that Blythe knew, she took herself off to Uni and made sure that she was unnoticeable. She kept herself to herself, did not have a roommate, never socialised, just plodded through the crap that was her life, she felt she was a nothing, no use to anyone, she would drink herself into stupors just to forget, just to try and be something even just for a short while, but it never worked, it was always so much worse in the mornings. She goes for a stroll and happens to chance upon a man at the lake, she stares, she watches, she feels that there is some instant connection to this stranger and she feels pulled. Unlike Blythe in any shape or form she makes a move and talks. Chris, the said stranger, he too a broken soul, we always knew he was hiding something, but Jessica leaks his past slowly throughout the book and it just adds to the suspense of the story. I did have an inkling as to where the plot twist would come and I was right, but as it was revealed my heart just broke all over again. It is like a car crash, you can see it happening and you just brace yourself for the impact, but when it hits you, you feel the shock and the pain, then you freeze....you pat yourself down, check that you are OK and then sit back and wonder what the hell just happened. Well, Jessica Park just came up and hit you smack between the eyes!! Some may say that this is a insta love, it is and it isnt, they both feel the connection immediately, but it is not acted upon for a long time. Blythe too scared to say or do anything and Chris wanting to but feels that he is too broken to offer anything. They become friends, along with the rest of the Shepherd family. I love this family, this is where Jessica really gets her wicked sense of humour across, Sabin and Estelle were amazeballs. I love it when a book totally engrosses you with all the side characters and every side character in this book had a major part to play. Some may say Sabin was annoying, he was brilliant, the friendship that he and Blythe built was so touching and so needed for both of them, it was beautiful. Estelle, some may say crazy, but what an amazing best friend, even though she was hurting herself, the strength she passed to Blythe was courageous despite battling her own demons. Eric and Zach, such a cute couple, you just loved them. It was such a tight knit family and they all just welcomed Blythe with open arms. Blythe and Chris ground each other, whilst in the beginning it is Chris that brings Blythe out of her pity party, it soon becomes apparent that Chris needs rescuing from his own and Blythe wants to be the person to do it. The trouble is that Chris, whilst he wants to be rescued, it takes him a long time to realise it, he believes that he cannot be fixed, that he is not worthy and so he does something so incredibly stupid I could have killed him myself...I wanted to jump in the kindle and throttle him. Throughout this book, you feel the connection building, it is palpable, it pulls you in like a moth to a flame and you cannot move away from the light, you keep reading, you become more emotionally invested, you fall in love with the characters, you fall in love with the story and then bam...you are hit by that light, that ugly zap that tries to kill you outright..and boy did it kill me. I was like, no this cannot be happening, this is not what should be happening and you carry on reading like a sadist thinking FFS, this is not blinking happening...but it does and it carries on and you cannot help but continue. But alas, do not worry my dear readers, the world does right its axis eventually but not after you have been eaten, chewed, spat out and left for dead...but it is a truly brilliant read. No matter how many the tears I spilled I could read this over and over and over again...yes I am willing to put myself through that again, but it was a joy to read. This is a story about loss, grief, learning to live again, survival, learning to love and trust and most of all learning to heal and forgive. This review is testament to Jessicas writing, it does cover some hard hitting subjects, especially child abuse but it is done sensitively, thoughtfully but most of all it is heart breaking. You feel everything! It is very difficult for an author to make you feel this much, only a few books have managed to do this to me and I am always shocked when they do, you always know when that happens you have read a brilliant book, and this book is truly brilliant. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, but make sure you have loads of tissues to hand because if you are like me, you are going to need them. Oh and Jessica, I want that TShirt......Youve hit 70....now cry like a bh!! www.theromancecover.com
Ive come across a few articlesbooks as of late about the role attachment disorder has in children in the foster care program, and the issues this creates. I had those stories in mind as I read Vanessa Diffenbaughs The Language of Flowers. Chiefly because, without my own empathy, I would have failed to fully appreciate its narrator, Victoria Jones; a deeply flawed main character. This debut novel by Vanessa Diffenbaugh should be a best seller, if it isnt already. Her writing is both risky and extremely exciting; she is exactly the type of writer you should watch out for. But also it had such a moving story line in telling the story of Victoria, from her abandonment at birth, through childhood abuse, to her orphanage experiences and her difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. Victorias life is portrayed with a depth of a feeling that pulls the reader into caring about this strange and sometimes difficult young woman. The story moves back and forth in time and place within the span of her life which brings greater meaning to why she behaves the way she does with people she meets. The Language of Flowers opens with 18 year old VIctoria being released from a group home with the admonition, Your life starts here. No one is to blame but yourself from here on out. Victoria muses, the social worker respinsible for selecting the stream of adoptive families that gave me back, wanted to talk to me about blame. From this point, we follow Victoria as she struggles to survive physically and emotionally from this starting point, and nine years earlier. The two tracks are faithfully followed every other chapter  the 9 year old in the foster care system, and the 18 year old product of that very flawed system. The common thread running through the book is flowers. The title derives its name from the Victorian practice of communicating through flowers, Each flower was given a meaning, and by presenting a given flower to another, one could communicate that meaning. A charming little book, The Language of Flowers, illustrated by the famous Kate Greebwat, is perhaps the best known of surviving books that purport to assign meanings to various flowers and plants. This symbolic system of communication was very popular in VIctorian times and formed a wellloved part of courtship. Ladies would delight in receiving and deciphering the messages contined in bouquets and nosegays. Do yourself a favor and check out Victorias Dictionary of Flowers at the end of the book where the index would go  I didnt discover it until I had finished the novel. It adds an element of fun knowing a bit about flowers meanings while reading. From the very first sentence, you are grabbed by the collar and not let go of, until the very last page. With that first line, the reader enters a present day world of the principle character Victoria Jones. It is Victorias 18th birthday, and she is being emancipated from the foster care system. The birthday greeting she is given by the other girls in the group home provides a vivid glimpse of the world Victoria has lived in most of her life. It also causes the reader to wonder what it is about Victoria that warrants such behaviour. VIctoria is not a character the reader instantly loves. She is not charming, beautiful, or especially talented. Victoria does not communicate well or relate well to others. She is often angry and unpredictable. It is only through these alternating chapters that we readers are offered glimpses of Victorias past, and the reader gains a little understanding of the reasons for her behaviors, and feels some compassion for her. But the novel makes it clear early on that Victoria is more than a willful brat, as she sabotages bother foster homes and schools. For if she becomes close to anyone in that foster home, she will be hurt when she is pulled out at the end of the year, or if she has to move again. At school she is taunted for being an orphan, and so she makes it a point to get kicked out. Her actions are rational on both counts, as she is reducing harmpain to herself. What appears on the outside to be selfdestrctive behaviour to the social service bureacracy are actions calculated to place Victoria in a situation where she can avoid all emotional harm by not being rejected for adoption by a foster family, or taunting by classmates. These are selfpreserving behaviours, and are common in children who are abused as well as fostered. The social services, on the other hand, unwillingly set up a souldestorying system for children with no familes. Meredith the social worker is NOT an unfeeling Nurse Rachettype. She is really a cog in the same system, tied into knots of regulations, rules and laws, unable to do any differently  in fact, only doing the best she can. Victorias own future, in the presentdaystoryline, is uncertain at best. The foster care systen isnt set out to adequately prepare foster children for a life on their own. Althought Victoria is allotted three mos. in a transitional home before being thrown out entirely on her own, she doesnt receive the guidance of training she needs to make her own way. Unable to deal with her reality, she wanders the streets, frittering her precious time away. She ends up homeless, living in a public park, until a local florist nearby gives her a chance at employment and discovers her talent with flower arrangement. In fact, Victoria runs into a number of characters whom she must deal with, even though her interactive skills are virtually nil. All she has is her knowledge of flowers and their meaning to make her way in life. Once Victoria used the language of flowers, learned from the only foster mother who really cared for her, loved her, and wanted to keep her, it all made sense to her. This source of communication expresses sentiments best left unspoken in the world of foster care. Sentiments such as grief, anger, hate, mistrust, and anguish, or pain. Then this source of communication takes a turn as she discovers in the florist work a gift for helping others, by creating arrangements based on this language. Here again, hope asserts itself. In the interactions with customers who need her special gift, a budding friendship with the florist Renata, and a few others Renata introduces her to, cause Victoria to begin to have hope for herself, and her future. While the publisher touts the book as one about second chances, I kept wondering where on earth Victorias first chance was. And if that second chance was nearly enough. The novel depicts people as better than we may think they really are, but they too require second chances because they screw things up as well. In fact, everyone in this novel has regretted something, and everyone here has pain as well... These nuances are explored. The past is concidered. Actions are reevaluated. All while Victoria struggles with her selfworth and trying to love herself. This book must have been difficult to wrap up in a way for the reader to come away less than fully depressed; the scenes with the baby were especially harrowing for me, as the author walked a fine line between neglect and barely caregiving; love and fear. But what would have even been worse is if Diffenbaugh had stapled on a contrived Disney ending, ending in plastic happiness. I am sure we are all too familiar with the horror stoies about the foster care system, and while it definitely needs improvement, as the author can attest from her own experiences as a care giver, dont we all need a little light in the darkness? In my opinion, the author worked out the ending just right, so that the reader came through the experience with understanding Victoria and her situation, and while she is still wary of feelings, she can work them through the language of flowers. And let us all remember that the human spirit is capable of enduring much, and still bring forth its best qualities. Or, as Diffenbaughs site asserts: Any one can grow into something beautiful. Vanessa Diffenbaugh, thank you for a very good read! I had intended on reading a couple chapters last night, and instantly found myself trapped within its pages, and held captive, until well after midnight, when I was forced to go to bed. I could not wait to get back into Victorias world as soon as possible this morning, either. I send you a bouquet of Canterbury bells gratitude, laurel in recognition of your sucess, sage good health and long life, lupine imagination, and forsythia anticipation of your next novel.
Find this and more book reviews on my blog: My Bookshelf Dialogues What this book is about: MarieLaure went blind at the young age of six and since then she has learned to live and walk around her hometown in France with the help of her Papa. Her father works at the Museum of Natural History as the keeper of the keys and has built a miniature model of the town for MarieLaure to feel and remember by touch. When the Nazis preoccupy France, MarieLaure and her Papa have to flee to SintMalo to live with her greatuncle. MarieLaure doesnt know that her father has in his possession on of the most precious stones of the Museum and this fact alone puts them all in grave danger. Werner is an orphan living with his sister Jutta and other orphans under the protection of a French woman called Frau Elena. Their future, they all know, is for young boys to go work in the mines and for girls to work in factories. But Werner is a curious and bright boy and when he fixes an old radio, he becomes wellknown in the community as a young repairerelectrician. Soon he is accepted in a prestigious but brutal Hitler Youth academy. Werner thinks his future is not with the mines but with studying electricity and so he goes. It took me a long time to read this book and one thing I can say for sure is that its not for everyone. This was the first time that I read literary fiction in English and it took me some time to warm up to it. This is not your typical YA novel or your typical historical novel even though it can be easily categories in both genres. I admire the amount of work and talent that went into writing, crafting and conceptualising this story. It is beautifully written, it is complex and at the same time rather simple. The story is told in both real life descriptions and in metaphores and that fact makes it perfect for discussions and group readings. Up and down the lanes, the last unevacuated townspeople wake, groan, sigh. Spinsters, prostitutes, men over sixty. Procrastinators, collaborators, disbelievers, drunks. Nuns of every order. The poor. The stubborn. The blind. Some hurry to bomb shelters. Some tell themselves it is merele a drill. Some linger to grab a blanket or a prayer book or a deck of playing cards. This a very different book from what Im used to. First of all, it is written in very small chapters that dont necessarily follow up one after the other. It is more of a collection of glimpses into the lives of different people. Different times, different events. It jumps back and forth between 1944 and the past, starting in 1934 and ascending to finally meet toward the end in 1944 again. Werner and MarieLaure live very different lives and this is the story about how their fates intertwine at various points in time without them even knowing. One step behind her, her father tilts his head up and gives the sky a huge smile. MarieLaure knows this even though her back is to him, even though he says nothing, even though she is blind  Papas thick hair is wet from the snow and standing in a dozen angles off his head, and his scarf is draped asymmetrically over his shoulders, and hes beaming up at the falling snow. Anthony Doerr uses both scientific and crude language to construct a beautiful, great pictures from its parts. Its like when you read this book you are looking at things through a magnifying glass. You get to see some tiny particles performing their role, doing their function independently of others. At the end you sit back and you are then able to see the whole pictures, all these parts that were working together and you couldnt quite figure out what they were doing, come to form a grand scheme. This is all the light we cannot see. All these tiny little pieces of story or history, of life, of movement and of action that we are not aware of, that we cannot perceive. But we perceive the whole at the end. At least thats my interpretation of the book which might of course be very different from others. A demonic horde. Upended sacks of beans. A hundred broken rosaries. There are a thousand metaphors and all of them are inadequate: forty bombs per aircraft, four hundred and eighty altogether, seventytwo thousanf pounds of explosives. What was difficult to understand and accept in the beginning of me picking up this book was that, this is not a book about the plot. Its about the narration. Its about getting lost in the words and their meaning and the games the author played and how he puts them all together to make them his bitches. The plot is not that exciting and is not something we havent heard before from WWII stories. And it took me a while to warm up to this concept, as I already said. Initially, I couldnt really connect to the characters. Anthony Doerr doesnt explicitly state the emotions that go through peoples minds and how each character felt in situations they were in. But the beauty of it is that you get to think and give emotion and meaning to characters and their actions yourself. And the author has certainly done an excellent job in providing all the necessary information for the reader to find the emotion and to participate in the writing of this book. This is quite brilliant. You will become like a waterfall, a volley of bullets  you will all surge in the same direction at the same pace toward the same cause. You will forgo comforts; you will live by duty alone. You will eat country and breathe nation. A brilliant work. Wellcrafted, finethreaded. My suggestions are that you pick this up in its original language if you dont mind reading in English, so you can enjoy Anthony Doerrs talented prose. This is probably not a book for those who dont enjoy literary fiction and more complicated writing styles that need to be investigated further because it can be frustrating. I wish I could recommend this book to everyone but... One last thing to say is that I also listened to the audiobook of All the Light We Cannot See narrated by Zach Appelman. Its read in an American accent and I quite enjoyed his voice and narration style. I also think this is a book that is made for someone to read it out loud to you. Just saying.. Read this amazing book guys! Read it.

This review is testament to Jessicas writing, it does cover some hard hitting subjects, especially child abuse but it is done sensitively, thoughtfully but most of all it is heart breaking. You feel everything! It is very difficult for an author to make you feel this much, only a few books have managed to do this to me and I am always shocked when they do, you always know when that happens you have read a brilliant book, and this book is truly brilliant. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, but make sure you have loads of tissues to hand because if you are like me, you are going to need them. Oh and Jessica, I want that TShirt......Youve hit 70....now cry like a bh!! www.theromancecover.com
Breathtaking. I fell in love with this book as if I had visited the circus myself. Simply magical. The circus arrives without warning. Le Cirque des Reves. The Circus of Dreams. The Night Circus. The complex board for a game of sorts, a test of illusion and manipulation, sheer will and innate ability. A challenge, with only one victor. A mirror you look in to see the other half of yourself. This review is surprisingly difficult to write. Reading this book was like seeing a dream you had cherished greatly become real before your very eyes, or watching the life and death of a single red rose. I felt strongly as if I was watching a chess match from beginning to end  for how often the characters insisted it was not like chess, the structure of the book as a whole certainly was. I am strictly a chess amateur, but there is always the same pattern when I play with a close friend of mine: Part I, when my opponent and I begin deciding what our strategy should be, and feeling each other out without making any explicit moves towards or away from the other. Part II, when we attack headon; my wits and quick thinking against his careful planning and skill, minor pieces leaving the board to be replaced with stronger ones, no longer testing the waters but coming face to face with each others expert maneuvers. Part III, when a key piece is lost, and suddenly you witness your fortress tear apart at the seams until it is simply the two of you, no longer able to win or lose, stuck at a stalemate where each of you is too clever to do anything except purposefully end the game and stand to lose a part of yourself. Standing on the platform in the midst of the crowd, high enough that they can be viewed clearly from all angles, are two figures, still as statues. They stand entwined but not touching, their heads tilted towards each other. Lips frozen in the moment before or after a kiss. Though you watch them for some time they do not move. No stirring of fingertips or eyelashes. No indication that they are even breathing. They cannot possibly be real, someone nearby remarks. Many patrons only glance at them before moving on, but the longer you watch, the more you can detect the subtlest of motions. The change in the curve of a hand as it hovers near an arm. The shifting angle of a perfectly balanced leg. Each of them always gravitating towards each other. Yet still they do not touch. This is how the challenge has gone for many, many years, and yet Celia and Marco are the ones who stand to break the tradition apart. At first it is in a much less noticeable way, from the way the circus is constructed and moved, to who is picked to be the pieces in the challenge of the circus. Then it grows, tent by tent, Celia and Marco each showing their hand to the other  falling deeper in love to someone they have never truly met, and yet know almost as well, if not better, than they know themselves. When it crests, it as if the whole world quakes beneath them. This kind of love that they share with each other is not the kind you see in your average romance novels: where a character may gravitate towards their love interest like a moth to a flame, Celia and Marco collide with a force that echoes deep into your very bones. It is a fiery, passionate form of selfdestruction, suffocating in its intensity, but purer than an uncut gemstone for all of its disturbing beauty. This is not the kind of romance that you would sigh after reading and say, oh, I wish I could be swept away on an adventure like that! It is difficult and melancholy with the pain of raw emotion that torments and shakes you long after the memory has faded away. The sign outside this tent is accompanied by a small box full of smooth black stones. The text instructs you to take one with you as you enter. Inside, the tent is dark, the ceiling covered with open black umbrellas, the curving handles hanging down like icicles. In the center of the room there is a pool. A pond enclosed within a black stone wall that is surrounded by white gravel. The air carries the salty tinge of the ocean. You walk over to the edge to look inside. The gravel crunches beneath your feet. It is shallow, but it is glowing. A shimmering, shifting light cascades up through the surface of the water. A soft radiance, enough to illuminate the pool and the stones that sit at the bottom. Hundreds of stones, each identical to the one you hold in your hand. The light beneath filters through the spaces between the stones. Reflections ripple around the room, making it appear as though the entire tent is underwater. You sit on the wall, turning your black stone over and over in your fingers. The stillness of the tent becomes a quiet melancholy. Memories begin to creep forward from hidden corners of your mind. Passing disappointments. Lost chances and lost causes. Heartbreaks and pain and desolate, horrible loneliness. Sorrows you thought long forgotten mingle with stillfresh wounds. The stone feels heavier in your hand. When you drop it in the pool to join the rest of the stones, you feel lighter. As though you have released something more than a smooth polished piece of rock. If I could spend this entire review just quoting passages about the Circus, I would. There are so many excellent ones that resonated deeply with me. To be frank, the best part of this book was the writing. I cant say that I have ever read a book that was so full of imagery and imagination amongst the hundreds of books I have read in my lifetime. The entire novel felt real, the same way that you can wake up in a dream and not realize that you are still asleep. I could picture myself in every tunnel, every tent, as if I was the patron and they were the ones watching me. Each of the characters was fleshed out and developed in an incredibly unique way. The story progressed with them, moved next to them in their carts on the circus train, watched their performances, and attended Midnight Dinners right alongside them. Even talking about them feels like dancing as they danced with the grace of gymnasts. When they cracked, you cracked with them; when they laughed or cried, your own tears were a hairs breath away. It is a magical experience to be a part of this work of art. It is a story you never want to end, but you know when the time comes that you cannot hold on to it any longer. I honestly cannot imagine how Erin managed to make every single piece of this book feel so vibrant and alive, yet she executed it perfectly with immeasurable skill and aptitude. There is no possible way for me to describe each individual aspect of this book with the justice it deserves, so all I can say is that I highly implore you to pick it up and give it a chance. Not everybody will enjoy it as irrevocably as I do, but I hope that it touches you in a new yet strangely familiar way nonetheless. The step through the gates that takes you from painted group to bare grass feels heavy. You think, as you walk away from Le Cirque des Reves and into the creeping dawn, that you felt more awake within the confines of the circus. You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is a dream.
4.5 STARS A spectacular third book in the Lunar Chronicles that will have your head spinning in pure bliss! Filled with all the same fun characters from all the previous books, and some new and intriguing ones that bring a different kinda dynamic to the story, with a thickened plot and a world of trouble and drama, CRESS has lived up to all my expectations and some! What a mind blowing ride CRESS took me on! I learned early on from book one not to underestimate Meyers and her mad writing skills. But for some crazy reason I always do just that, and each book just gets better and better, surprising me with a more engaging read each time! This book was hypnotizing and absolutely addicting from the very first page. I could not put it down for nothing, and I loved all the new and exciting characters that were introduced and became a great addition to this fantastic series! The characters were once again wonderful! Theirs so many main characters in this book that you would think it would be hard to follow, but surprisingly its not. I found that all the characters and different POVs only developed the story more, making it complex and that much stronger. I really liked how in the beginning all the characters were together, and then slowly they all started getting separated from each other because of a different traumatic event that in my opinion only strengthened the story. And then you have all the different POVs from the characters in different places and your able to see whats going on all around the world. I loved all the characters for different reasons. Cinder because the girl has been through much and is still determined to save the same people who once mocked her for her disability. And plus shes going to kick Queen Levanas a when they finally face off in WINTER, I KNOW she is, at least she better! ; That btch Levana needs a taste of her own medicine. But I still love her as the wicked villain that she is that only makes this story that much more as awesome! Scarlet because she has this admirable strength that only multiplies tenfold when she feels threatened. And when the girl loves, she loves hard! I think she may even be my favorite of them all! I dont know though, I do LOVE Cinder and Iko too! Cress because the girl brings a new light to this book that this series never had. And shes sweet and innocent, yet shes not afraid to get her hands dirty even when her lifes on the line for strangers. And Iko is soo funny and instantly likable. Being an android and having so much personality and sense of humanity that is full of life and a bubbly demeanor only strengthened the book and brought a fun tone to the story. Okay, now for the boys. . . Kai, ohhhhh, KAI is sooo swoony! Hes Emperor, yet you wouldnt be able to tell if you didnt know who he was. Hes down to earth and genuinely cares about people. Hes also extremely hot but doesnt think hes better then anyone, and is willing to put himself last to save is country. Wolf because hes totally badas on the outside, yet when hes with Scarlet hes a big softy thatll would walk to the end of the world for. He is definitely my kinda guy! ; THORNE, ohhhh, Thorne! Hes another favorite of mine! The boy is all sarcasm and hotness! I LOVE HIM!!! Hes always making light of any situation, and can make you laugh when really you shouldnt. He also lives behind his jokes, trying to hide the real him that is loyal and caring, and brave even when he doesnt want to see it!! So there you have it, just a quick little bit of why I love each and every one of our main characters. But theirs still so many more admirable reasons of why their all so awesome. And though Cinder is at the forefront of them all, theyre all still equally important to the story for their own reasons. And I think Meyers did a wonderful job at creating each of them and developing just the right amount of characterization! Im looking forward to officially meeting Winter, but from what I can gather, she may be a little cuckoo for cocoa puffs, but is still the fairest of them all! ; THE PLOT: CINDER: Still on the run from both Earth and Luna, Cinder and her group of rebels are barley evading authorities as they prepare to face off with Levana and restore Cinder, the rightful heir to the Lunar throne. But their journey has been tedious and nothing short of deadly, and if they dont succeed in their mission, not only will they be doomed, but also all of Earth and Luna. CRESS: Cress has daydreamed about the day her prince charming would rescue her from the tower and slay the evil monster, the day has finally arrived... Born a shell with no Lunar gift, and considered unworthy to live in society with the rest of her fellow Lunars, Cress, like all other shells are taken at birth and immediately executed in order to rid the moon of the abomination they bring when born. But, the secret that not many Lunars know, is that theyre not really executed when taken from their parents. The truth is their blood is special, and harvested for the cure it holds for the rampant letumosis disease killing thousands of Earthens. They cannot be controlled by other Lunars, but they also have no mind controlling powers either. But Cress has a special talent far more worthy then just her blood, and is about to become just as deadly . . . Cress is Queen Levanas best hacker, and shes been spying on Earth for far too long. Forced to do evil things for the queen, Cress has been imprisoned in her Satellite where shes cutoff from humanity and only has a mini version of herself for a companion. She has been secretly helping Cinder evade authorities from her seclusion in her Satellite, but Cress fears if she doesnt start producing results in locating Cinder soon, then she may find herself facing a punishment she wont make it out of alive. But how can she turn in the same people that could be her only hope for freedom? SCARLET: Scarlet is now carrying out her grandmothers last wishes by helping Cinder on her mission to save both the people of Earth and Luna by dethroning the evil tyrant Levana from the Lunar thronethus saving earth from having a new evil Empress claiming their world for herself, and all her evil plans she has in store for them! Scarlet and their newly formed group of rebels have a plan, if only she can stay alive long enough to carry it out. . . CRESS was an exceptional book that did a wonderful job with setting up the finale for the final installment in WINTER. I loved how this novel was evened out and weighed the chapters with the pace that made it all come together and fit just right. I especially thought CRESS went out with a bang, and was as solid as any ending could be. And I LOVED that Cinder and Kai FINALLY got to see each other again. Even if we only got a little time with them, it still set my heart aflame to have them back together again! I am so eager to start WINTER, yet hesitant to read it because I dont want it to be over just yet! Overall, CRESS was a fantastic third installment that any Lunar fan would truly love! With a thickened plot and thrilling action, CRESS was tons of fun as sparks flew in this installment. I will forever love this series and will eagerly read anything Meyers writes next! If your a HUGE Lunar fan then this is one installment you wont want to miss! NOTE: I received a physical ARC from Feiwel and Friends for reviewing purposes! All opinions expressed are my own and are not influenced in any way!
Ive had a lifetime of wrong. Youre the only thing thats right. I should probably start this review with a small confessionI was not a Beautiful Disaster groupie when everyone was proclaiming their undying love for Travis Mad Dog Maddox and naming their daughters Abby. Not because I did not like it, but simply because I never read it when it was first released, and thus never embraced the craze. As curiosity got the better of me and I finally decided to dive in, while I appreciated why this story was loved so desperately by so many readers out there, I think I was too old to swoon over nineteenyearold bad boys and obsessive first loves. But I totally got it. I got why this story, this tumultuous type of relationship, appealed to such a wide and varied audience, and how it earned such a loyal cult following by providing the reader with the type of escapism that reminds us all of our first loves, of how impetuous our young hearts once were, and of how crazy and hotheaded that first rush of hormones truly made us. This book, once more, is a reminder of it all, albeit on a more subdued level, but still succeeding in reawakening the memory of those troublesome years when we were finding ourselves, our place in the world around us, and navigating through life on our own for the very first time, regularly losing ourselves in the oblivion of it all. And all the while adamantly believing that every feeling, every emotion, every mindblowing first was the sum of all we would ever get to experience in life. No one has ever wanted someone as much as I want you. As we return to the delicious world of the Maddox brothers and the young women who steal their hearts at last, we finally get to know Trenton Trent Maddox, Travis elder brother and the son their widowed father depends on the most. A bad boy of sorts just like his younger brother, Trents heavily tattooed facade and hot temper give the impression of walking through life without feeling deeply or becoming emotionally attached to anyone, but nothing could be further from the truth. Beneath this defiant mask hides a sensitive and heartbroken young man whose fear of experiencing loss again, coupled with never having faced his past traumas, have made him a brewing pit of anger and irritability. But just like every fire has a source, every yin has its yang, and Trents antidote comes in the form of a brownhaired pixie with curves in all the right places and an outspoken personality to match. Its a small town. You shouldnt have burned all of your bridges. Theres a few I havent lit a fire under. Yet. Camille Cami Camlin is the girl next door, the oldest child and only girl in a family of all boys, a young woman whose confidence does not stem from the effect she has on the opposite sex, but rather from her selfawareness and determination to be independent in life. And unlike most females of her age, she has remained impervious to the Maddox charm while growing up, and even more so in her early twenties as she has watched them add notch after notch to their headboards. Trent and Cami have known each other all their lives, but were never friends as such. His reputation has always preceded him and thus made him an unwelcome dating candidate in her eyes. Id seen him flirt, seduce, and evade since we were kids. There was absolutely no trick Trenton Maddox could play that I wouldnt be ready for. However, when a Maddox sets his mind on something, he is not to be easily persuaded to change it, and once he enters Camis life, Trent is there to stay. Ignoring all her insistent attempts to drive him away and discourage his efforts, he makes himself at home in her daily life, becoming a friend she didnt know she needed, loyal and protective, all the while not making it secret that he wishes for more. Or that not even Camis long distance relationship with a boyfriend she rarely sees would deter him from pursuing her. I was just thinking now was as good a time as any to acknowledge that youre perfect and it wouldnt suck if you fell madly in love with me anytime soon. I have a boyfriend. Speed bump. The more time they spend with one another, and the more he treats her as if the world revolved around her, the more she starts questioning everything else in her life and facing it all one by one. Trent represents the mess, impulsiveness and uncertainty her past has taught her to fear and avoid at all costs, but he is also the mirror of many qualities she has always wished to eradicate in herself, and the more she allows herself to accept him as he is and all that he embodies, the more she starts accepting those traits in herself, no longer perceiving them as flaws. On the other hand, Cami is a grounding force for Trents volatile Maddox gene, his desire to make her love him making him want to be the type of man to deserve her affections. They are opposites in so many ways, and yet when they are together, those differences are what makes them so perfect for one another. Have you ever wanted something that you knew you shouldnt have? That it was wrong on every level, but you knew you needed it? This is in essence a story of two people becoming each others passage into adulthood by giving one another the courage to grow up and face their fears. Its a story that held me enthralled from the very beginning, happy as a clam to indulge in the simplicity of the fantasy of a bad boy falling for the good girl, of a boy pursuing a girl relentlessly, shamelessly and with all his might. I did feel throughout the entire story, however, like I was missing a vital clue, a key of sorts to unlock the motivation behind the heroines actions, and I have to admit that until the very last page, she was a paradox to me. But then everything came together all of a sudden, the puzzle pieces all magically falling into place and I found myself speechless, frantically cataloguing the clues we were given unsuspectingly, and finally understanding her character. A few gaps in the story still left me wishing they had been explored and capitalised on more to make it an even more cohesive and emotionally richer storyline, especially references to past events that clearly affected the characters in a way that they now needed to overcome them. But I am hoping that subsequent instalments in this brand new series will fill those gaps and that as we got a new glimpse into Travis and Abbys story, we will get a similar one into Trent and Camis as well. This book is an absolute treat for the Beautiful Disaster fans out there, old and new, and one cannot help but fall in love with yet another Maddox brother. It left me greedy for more and with a sudden interest in getting cashmere comfortable. Im a fckup, but Im going to get it figured out. I swear. Just . . . dont give up on me, okay?

Once again, I love the story Amy Harmon told us. I absolutely adore her writing it touches me each and every time. My Kindle is always full of highlights, all the sentences and quotes I found insightful. This book is no exception to the rule as youll see below. Words have power and used correctly, they move some deep part inside of me that makes me bawl like a baby, laugh out loud, tighten my throat, fill me with awe and wonder... In The Song of David, Amy used her magic wand to weave a beautiful and poignant tale about a selfdestructing man. He is at war with his past actions until he found a home when he met that incredible blind girl and her flawed but so loveable brother. Perk of that story: we dont have one hero but three incredible heroes. David may be great with his flaws, his drawl, his hero complex but Millie was brilliant and Henry was touching. In my mind, the real hero is Millie, even if the book is named after David. I absolutely loved that girl. She became blind but instead of wallowing in selfpity, sheltering herself from the outside world, she embraces life fully. Even if she is afraid all the time, she imagines new challenges and goes after her dream because: After a while, I realized if I allowed myself to be too afraid to do anything, that I wouldnt just be blind, I might as well be dead. That girl has more guts than most. I wont tell too much about her as I dont want to spoil that story but I can say she is a pole dancer and dares going to Tags bar alone. She auditions in front of strangers, in an unknown environment and gets the job. Each night, she comes alone to give her show. I used to dance and do gymnastics. I used to leap and turn. I could do it all. And I didnt need a pole. Just like I used to walk down the street and chase my friends and live my life without my stick. But that isnt an option anymore. That pole means I can still dance. I dont need to see to dance in that cage. If that means Im not a classy girl, so be it. Its a tiny piece of a dream that I had to give up. And Id rather have a piece of a dream than no dream at all. Chapeau bas for Millie because  The world was a scary place for most people. For Amelie, it was downright lethal. She was completely vulnerable. If the world is too flat, people like me will slide right off. And yet she didnt hesitate at all. When Millie fell for David yes, its a love story, she could not see him with her eyes but she could see him with her heart, her touch. She could see the real David. And Amy once more gives us a lesson: our eyes are not as important as our heart to really see people. We have to pay attention to the small details and not let us be distracted by the outer appearance, the big picture. Stop running and moving all the time, stay still and really observe. Take notice of these tiny details. Enjoy life, the sun, the air, the sounds of the birds... I found myself hoping David wasnt a good looking guy. I hoped he wasnt good looking because it didnt matter to me, and it would make him less desirable to everyone else. I thought if he were homely, it would make him more open to someone like me. ...But I knew he was beautiful. It was in the way he carried himself, his confidence, his kindness. The book is more than a pure love story. Built like a thriller, we have to find the missing person sans killer. The story is about DavidTag Taggert disappearing act and his friends looking after him. Where is David? Is he alive? Millie, the girl he loves, Moses and Georgia with the whole Tag Team are collecting clues he left behind to find him before its too late. David had suicidal tendencies and Moses made a promise once. To always catch David, look after him, never let go and make sure he does not kill himself. And thats what he intends to do.  Tag Taggert became my best friend. When I needed him most he held on to me, and he didnt let me go. So now I have to find him. The thing that scares me the most, is maybe hes found his answers. Maybe he knows exactly what hes doing. Exactly who he is. Maybe hes figured the world out. Through the tapes he left for Millie, we can read about their love story and David journey. I loved that little trick used by Amy and I loved seeing Moses and Georgia. It was like a huge epilogue of Moses and Georgias story! He narrates his past, his life as a charming Texan and a ladies man. David tells us his fights and his guilt. He sees his many flaws but does not realize he is a hero and a savior, always defending weak or oppressed people. Son of a rich man, he did not want to follow in his fathers shoes:  It was a road I hadnt built, and Im convinced you cant ever be completely happy walking on someone elses road. Someone elses path. The way to true happiness is to forge your own, even if your road isnt straight. Even if there are bridges to build and mountains to tunnel through. Nothing feels as good as paving your own way. When he met Millie he fell hard for her and wanted to settle for the first time in his life. She is a package deal with her younger brother, Henry. Henry was so, so loveable. Rattling on sports fact better than any encyclopedia, without friends, hair too long and never combed, he lived in his own world. He was like Yoda, spurting out bouts of wisdom under the guise of sports statistic. He reminded me a little of Bailey, one of my favorite characters in Amys book. They are both weird, different and you could overlook them but they play a major role in the stories with some wakeup call at crucial moments. Oooups, as usual, my problem seems to make short reviews for Amys books as I could go on and on. Just know this book is another diamond and cherry on top, we have an incredible epilogue happening many, many years after the end of the story. I loved it! So fans of Amy and any reader looking for a well written thrillerlove story, get set: read!
Copy provided by author in exchange for an honest review Pain isnt just losing the person you love. Pain is losing the person you love, seeing them with somebody else, and not interfering because you know you cant give them the life they deserve. Have you read a book that leaves you breathless? Well, Paper Hearts by Claire Contreras was that kind of book for me. I absolutely LOVED this book. This book was everything every romance aficionado craves, wants, and needs when reading a love story. So when I first read Torn Hearts, I was immediately bewitched with the raw intensity, hurt, and love that Mia and Jensen had experienced in their relationship. My heart ached for these two because each of them made a choice. A choice that had affected them. And so in Paper Hearts, Ms. Contreras picks off where she had last left off and fast forward to five years, we are reunited with Mia and Jensen as they are given their second chance to rewrite their story. Every love story is beautiful. And the story of Mia and Jensen may be one of my favorites. Though their story may be filled with heartache, disappointments, what ifs, and hurt but one crucial and important thing mattered:LOVE. The love between these two was what made this book so beautiful. It was about growth, acceptance, forgiveness, and starting over. Ive lived in pain since the moment I lost you. Ive learned to live with it, but I havent learned to accept it. Mia Bennett loved Jensen Reynolds. He was her lover. Her friend. Her soulmate. Her everything. And when Jensen broke her heart and told her that he got another woman pregnant and was going to marry her, it completely broke her heart. The love, the dreams, the hope, and the future that she had for them were shattered. The picture perfect love story that she had envisioned was just a memory that left her broken. He didnt let her go because he loved her too much to ask her to stay, but because he couldnt bear to hear her say that she wouldnt. Jensen made one mistake but being a father was never a mistake. Jensen thought he did the right thing in letting Mia go because he knew he couldnt be the one to stand in the way of her happiness after what he did. We all know the saying if you love someone, let them go and if they come back to you, then you know its yours. Well, Jensen let Mia go and five years have passed and his second chance at love is standing right in front of him. Call it fate or what not but when Mia was hired for this temporary job where Jensen freelances, he knew he was given his second chance to make it right. His life sweetheart was within his grasp and he had to make her see that their story would finally get the happily ever after ending it deserves. The relationship of Mia and Jensen is a complicated love story. Its a story where two people had to really look within themselves to realize that true love isnt meant to be easy. That love doesnt appear on command and itll put you through hurdles but in the end, none of that will matter because its about how you overcame these hurdles that define your love. And for Mia, the greatest testament of her love will be her ability to really and whole heartily forgive Jensen. To accept his mistakes and to accept what comes along in loving Jensen. Paper Hearts took my heart. It made me feel every range of emotions and I loved experiencing the ups and downs of what Mia and Jensen had to go through. Though their love story may not be a perfect one but it is indeed a reminder that Mia and Jensen are two imperfect people who refuse to give up on each other. And that to me is a perfect love story. It is a story where the words of love cant be erased because its forever ingrained and etched in our mind, soul, and heart. So if you are willing to get lost in a book that has the power to twist your heart and shatter it to pieces, but slowly have the author tape them back together then Paper Hearts is the book for you. Thank you Ms. Contreras for writing one of the most beautiful, touching, breathtaking, aweinspiring, and tangible love stories that I have read. As an avid reader, I love reading books that can really make you FEEL. Feel the love, the hurt, the anger, the sadness, and most importantly feel the hope of possibilities. And Paper Hearts by Claire Contreras was one of those books that I can honestly say where I felt everything. I literally have no words to express of how much I LOVED this book because this book was so much more than a fictional romance story of Mia and Jensen but a story that everyone can relate to. Mia and Jensens story is a reflection of second chances at life and love. Ms. Contreras wrote a book that felt so REAL and RAW. A story where every facet of our life is about choices. The choice to forgive, to move on, to start over, to heal, and to love. I want to thank Claire for reminding us all that people who are meant to be together find their way back and they make take a few detours along the way but they are never lost. There are two sides to every story. And in this story, Ms. Contreras takes us down one emotional, touching, heartbreaking and yet profoundly beautiful love story. A love story and bond that was so tangible and palpable. A story that could only be told through the eyes of Mia and Jensen. No words are necessary between two loving hearts. So if you are looking for a story where boy meets girl, boy and girl falls in love, boy and girl separate, boy and girl never stopped loving each other, boy and girl grow up, and boy and girl reminds us that their happily ever after was just waiting to be told then I highly recommend you to read Paper Hearts. So I leave you with one of my favorite quote in the book because in truth this one line sums up this beautiful book: real love stories never end. PAPER HEARTS: Michelle Approved.

Maas is pretty much a fantasy genius. She has this ability to create such fascinating worlds filled with captivating characters, and she just seems to get better and better. This book was so beautifully written and Maas tackles each aspect with flair. The fantasy world was intricate and the plot, albeit a little slow, was enchanting. The action was riveting and entertaining. And the romance was a good mix of sexy and sweet. As far as first books in a series go, this one was a real winner. The one thing that bugged through most of the book was that I seriously couldnt understand WHY Tamlin spared Feyres life. It was veery abrupt in the beginning and you get tiny hints here and there, but it wasnt until close to the end of the book that the truth is revealed and his motives finally made sense. I hate when it takes so long for things to be revealed, but thats just me. Also, there were a lot of lulls throughout the book, especially in the beginning. It wasnt necessarily bad in the sense that I was bored or anything, but it made it so that it took me a longer to get through this book than I originally thought. Anyways, Im sure everyone is going to rave about and love Tamlin, but I have such a soft spot for Rhys. He was just plain awesome. Hes basically that kind of bad boy you love to hate. Hes not exactly the good guy, but I could tell from the beginning that his intentions are wellmeaning and his motives for doing a lot of what he does are definitely more selfless than everyone believes. It was kind of sad how he was basically the big joke of the fae world considering his status with the Queen, but like I said, I could tell there was more to it than it looks. I especially loved his interactions with Feyre. There is definitely some kind of attractive pull between them, and I seriously want more of them together. Dont get me wrong, this guy is dangerous and hes no saint, but theres definitely some good there that I am hoping Maas explores more in later books. Speaking of Tamlin, he took a bit of warming up to, but when we eventually see cracks through his armor, you cant help but start to care for him. He starts off very aloof and guarded, but he was also cordial and even sweet at times before things started really progressing between him and Feyre. I loved how he welcomed her hobbies and talents and made sure she was taken care of, despite basically being a prisoner. He was also surprisingly sexy when he went all dangerous beast on Feyre and did something pretty kinky that I reveled in. I dont know what that says about me. Anyways, I especially loved when he finally started showing how much he cared about Feyre and all that he did to protect her. Their relationship does move pretty slow, but it worked for them because he does start out as the captor and their situation isnt exactly ideal for romance, at least, not right off the bat. I think, in regards to their relationship, Maas did a great job with weaving in key elements of the Beauty and the Beast story. I could definitely see what I know of Beauty and the Beast in Feyre and Tamlin. Feyre is headstrong and independent and Tamlin is fierce and passionate. I cant exactly pinpoint when things started changing for them, but once their relationship got moving, it was really hard to resist them. There was one scene, after a particular festival, that I thought was delicious. So raunchy, I loved it! Oh, and can we all just take a minute to appreciate CHAPTER 27?! Good lord, Maas, what have you done to me?! Feyre is just plain awesome. I loved her from beginning to end. Maas just has a way of creating such amazing heroines that I would just love to know in person. Feyre cares so much for her family and does whatever she has to in order to care and protect them. I respected the fact that even though she was so far away from them and it was near impossible for her to return to them, she didnt stop finding ways to protect them. She just has that kind of personality that when she cares for someone, shes fiercely loyal and protective of them. Shes also very brave and determined. When she journeys deep into the land of the fae and goes against the Queen, man does she put up a fight! The odds were definitely against her and her mind and body get so damaged in the process, yet she never gives up. I will say that I wanted to shake her in regards to that riddle she was given. I mean, the answer was so obvious, but I guess Maas did things the way she did to build suspense and, honestly, if she had figured it out sooner, there wouldnt have been as much action and buildup, so Ill give her that. That ending was spectacular. So amazing. I am seriously dying for more from this series. I loved all the characters, the world Maas created was aweinspiring, and the romance was scintillating. This book definitely falls more in the upper YANA territory, so keep that in mind. Overall, an outstanding book and introduction to what Im sure will be an amazing series. I need more now, please!
It was about 44.5 almost the entire time, but then it made me cry so I decided to round all the way up. Hazel Grace Lancaster is a sixteenyearold who spends her time reading, watching admittedly bad TV with her parents, taking college classes, and dying fromliving with cancer. When she meets hunky, intriguing Augustus Waters at a local support group, shes pretty sure she has found a kindred spirit who not only matches her sense of humor and history with illness, but also counters her reluctance to live a full life and her desire to hunker down in solitude and misery. Shes especially thrilled when he reads and falls in love with her favorite book, but two kids with a history of cancer are an ominous beginning for a Great Teenage Love Story. I dont read a lot of YA, but when I do its usually for a good reason. I read this at The Wifes express recommendation, and Im really glad I did. This is a beautiful sad love story that feels authentic. It seems to defy some of the YA conventions which generally discourage me from reading the genre, and I really enjoyed getting lost in its little infinity for a few days. It just seemed to have an unexpected amount of substance. Hazel and Augustus are a wonderful pair of young lovers, and their relationship feels so genuinely teenage and believable that I never wanted their story to end. They talked and acted like teenagers admittedly very loquacious and wise teenagers, but still, a little sarcastic and snappy at times, but they also loved their parents a full set each! and were presented in a way that made it very hard to dislike them. I feel like the author was somehow able to get into and present the mind of a teenage girl in a way that felt genuine but also didnt make me want to claw my face off coughBellaSwancough. Hazels mind was an interesting place to be: witty, natural, sardonic, but still sweet. Augustus seemed at times too good to be true, but as his character was gradually developed, he seemed like the greatest guy ever and the best part of all: he was attractive and amazing, but Hazel didnt feel the need to tell us that EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. His character was deep enough that the attractiveness came across naturally, she didnt have to keep reminding us or describing his body or hair or eyes. He was hot, but he was much more than that. Even the side characters, even the ones who appeared for only a scene or two, felt believable and interesting, and everyone seemed to have real human quirks. The way they talked sometimes teetered on the line of being kind of annoying modern teen lingo, but it never really crossed it for me. The story was interesting and surprising and of course heartbreaking at times, but it never crossed over to maudlin, which a cancer story can VERY easily do. The way the author handled the reality of living with something you know will eventually kill you was insightful and kind of remarkable, and the ending was sad, but not depressing. It was tragic, but it was also much more than that. I generally had no idea what was going to happen, and each step of the journey was a splendid surprise and some not so splendid... Peter Von Houten, I just never know what youre going to say or do!. Even when things I generally expected happened, I still was somehow surprised. I laughed out loud, I teared up multiple times each, I tore through some pages and I lingered through others, and when it was over I couldnt stop thinking about it. There were some content issues, though apparently pretty minor compared to other YA books, and I thought there was a little bit of a slant against God and religion in general, but I was able to overlook this in the end because, 1 I feel like a teenager with a terminal illness and not much of a foundation regarding the beyond might feel like this sometimes, which is in some ways understandable, 2 it didnt seem malicious, just kind of defeatist and fatalist, and 3 I feel like it was redeemed a little, especially in Augustuss more open worldview, even if Hazel hasnt quite figured it out yet. I admit I agonized a little over my rating of this one, but in the end it totally engrossed me and I wished it didnt have to end so soon, and its not just any book that can make me feel that way. Oh, and as an aside, I did want to mention that the Walt Disney World pedant in me kind of took umbrage at inaccurateoutdated terminology relative to said theme park, but I let it slide in the end. :  This is a splendid book. Ive never had cancer, but I DO remember what it was like to be a teenager in love, and this book is a beautiful and honest and funny and sad presentation of that. Yes, I readily admit when a book makes me cry, and this one did, but it also made me laugh, and I cant seem to get over Hazel Grace and Augustus. I feel like this review hasnt managed to adequately describe how this book made me feel, but I dont know if any review I may write ever could. It was just nice and sad and funny and lovely and snarky and human and good. I wouldnt be at all against reading more John Green one day. P.S. Reading through some of the reviews here, I thought of something to add: Dur, of course its emotionally manipulative though thats not the term I would use, thats kind of the point of cinema and literature. Pride and Prejudice and Star Wars and any Thomas Hardy selection manipulate emotions as much as anything. Thats why we read  to feel things. That is all.  Notable quotes: Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction, which you cant tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal 33. ... the line was quiet but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone 72. You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are Augustus, 123. As Augustus read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once 125. I actually miread this one when I marked it, but I still like it, ha ha. Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin Dutch cabbie, 157. But yes. I believe in Something with a capital S. Always have Augustus, 168. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice... 209. ... and then he broke down, just for one moment, his sob roaring impotent like a clap of thunder unaccompanied by lightning, the terrible ferocity that amateurs in the field of suffering might mistake for weakness 215.
Cress by Marissa Meyer is the third in the Lunar Chronicles. If you havent heard of this series, be sure to check out my reviews of the first book, Cinder, and the second book, Scarlet, because this series is freaking fantabulous! I felt that Scarlet was even better than Cinder, and Cress does not disappoint this trend. While Cress was a slightly different book than the first two, it made my brain feel all warm and fuzzy every time I sat down to read. We meet new characters and get to know old ones better, there is epicness on so many levels, and I am EVEN MORE excited about the fourth book, Winter, than I was before! Note: A friend gave me an ARC of Cress to review. Some things may change in the final version. Cress by Marissa Meyer ARC 4.5 Stars Cress by Marissa Meyer Lunar Chronicles 3 Published by Feiwel  Friends on February 4th, 2014 Genres: Fairytale Retelling, Scifi, YA Length: 560 pages How I got my copy: Borrowed IndieBound  Book Depository  Goodreads Purchases made support this blog Rapunzels tower is a satellite. She cant let down her hairor her guard. In this third book in the bestselling Lunar Chronicles series, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, theyre plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army. Their best hope lies with Cress, who has been trapped on a satellite since childhood with only her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hackerunfortunately, shes just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice. When a daring rescue goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a high price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing stop her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only ones who can. Strengths: I feel that I must start with the title character: Cress! squeals I love her so much! I imagine that many of us are going to have Tangled flashbacks while reading Cress but I honestly think it totally works. Cinder and Scarlet are both kickbutt heroines, but Cress brings something new to the table. She has obviously led a pretty sheltered life with a skewed perspective on things mostly from watching net dramas.... and Meyer captures this wonderfully. Cress is a brilliant hacker but also adorably naive about a lot of things. She is a perfect edition to our fairy tale cast specifically because she isnt the typical kickbutt heroine who is too tough to cry! Omg yall, the twists! You know I love a good plot twist and I consider Cress to have more than one. They were the great kind, too, where they are kinda stressful because you know the characters lives are going to get more difficult, but also make perfect sense, but also just make you have to know what is going to happen! My pulse is rising just thinking about them .. The feels, wow, the feels. Scarlet definitely destroyed my emotions, but Cress doesnt pull any punches. They are made all the worse because you kind of know something has to happen, but its still so freaking emotional. There arent just sad feels though! Thorne and Cress had me squeeing and literally laughing out loud quite often ;. I love clever epic battles! You know when the hero saves the day against impossible odds not through luck or magically discovering some deep inner power but through being so dang clever?? That! That is awesome and that is what you get in Cress. We get little torturous hints about the character Winter and I am so freaking excited! Even though this is Cress, I am already impressed with how multifaceted Winter the character is going to be, not to mention the epicness of Winter the books plot.... Iko gets a couple of chapters from her perspective 3! Weaknesses: There are three couples now for those playing along at home and that is two more than most stories that we are used to have. All of the characters work great yey epic fantasy adventuring party!, but each of the romance pairings being so neat and tidy is a little annoying. I want a single fairytale princess, who needs boys?! Cress melted my heart, but I didnt get the whiteknuckle, edgeofyourseat feel that I had with Scarlet. I hit a point with Scarlet where I was literally getting white knuckles gripping the hardcover, and that just didnt happen with Cress which is probably good since it was a rather floppy ARC. I have very high hopes for Winter though ;. Summary: Really, at this point, you probably already know if you are going to read Cress or not. If you loved Scarlet, you will love Cress and Im so excited and a little jealous that you get to read it for the first time still :D. If you read Cinder and were only meh and not sure about continuing the series, continue the series! I cannot emphasize enough how much each books writing has grown and I love it. Im very impressed by how skillfully Meyer has weaved together three four in the end fairytale retellings, keeping each of the couples involved in the overarching storyline, and building this amazing scifi world to boot. Amazeballs if you ask me.
I.... Im done. And I have NO idea what Im supposed to do now... I dont even know how to feel.... I honestly just want to cry because its over... Wow. This has got to be some of Cassies best work, in my opinion. I dont even know where to begin! Theres just a lot I need to say. I might ramble quite a bit throughout this review, so I ask that you be patient with me and let me ride it out. Im feeling a LOT of things even after having processed my thoughts for two whole days. First of all, let me say. I absolutely LOVED this book. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Of the 100 things I needed this book to do, 99 of them were fulfilled in this conclusion. And I am on my knees in gratitude for Cassandra Clare. No one has rendered my mind, body, and soul to nonfunctioning capacities like she has and I really doubt no one will again. There were so many happy moments, so many sad moments, so many frustratingly annoying moments coughthe CLAVEcough. It was just really well done! Initially, when Cassie released the length of the book page numbers, I was like Oh no, this will either be really bad or really good. Typically when books are that long, there tends to be a lot of filler or moments of lull boredom. Let me tell you, Cassie is talented and skilled enough to keep you on your toes for all 700 pages. There was not a single moment where I didnt find myself emotionally invested in this book. I was on the edge of my seat. Now before I get into my review of plot, I will say  I am a diehard TMI fanatic. I loved it more than TID. I prefer Jace to Will; Alec to Jem; Clary to Tessa. Thats just my clear and honest opinion. BUT I absolutely ENJOYED The Infernal Devices. I just didnt cry buckets over it once it was over. I just appreciated it as being part of the beautiful Shadowhunter world that Cassie created. Now, onto City of Heavenly Fire... It was so good to see my favorite characters, my dream team, back in action. Jace, Clary, Alec, Isabelle, Simon  all of them hold such a dear place in my heart that I cant believe I went without them for so long. Seeing them banter, tease, and just love one another. It was just so heartwarming. The thing that I love about Cassandra Clare is that even in the midst of battle  a HUGE war  she will still find times for her characters to just love one another. To have fun. And thats so beautiful. Its human. THATS where my focus was in this story. How much humanity still remained, even after Sebastian was trying to steal it all? Cassie teased us about how many deaths there would be in the book  she said six. Six named character would die in this book. I counted more than six, but the word named seems to be subjective. But I think I got named confused with main and just assumed that a lot of the main characters would be biting the bullet. So I read this book with intense trepidation. I just couldnt see any of them dying. I was so in love with all of them  Clary, Jace, Alec, Izzy, Simon, Magnus, Jocelyn, Luke, Maia  and many more. I was so scared reading this book. Im not going to talk about scene after scene because I just dont feel that its necessary. If youve read the book, then you know what Im talking about. If you havent, then I havent spoiled much for you. I just want to discuss the handling of the book over all. Sebastian was always an extremely sinister guy, because he was evil. He had demon blood throughout his body, yet he was still a Shadowhunter. The guy was fucked up  for lack of a better phrase. He didnt care who he hurt or killed as long as his ultimate outcome was achieved. Thats some scary crap. Cassie did a fabulous job making my heart drop whenever he appeared in the book. You just never knew what he was capable of. I mean he KILLED Jordan, for goodness sake . Simply to make a point to the Downworlders! Throughout the book, Cassie continues to show us how heartless Sebastian is, but also how flawed he is. His understanding of the human heart and its capacity to love is clearly skewed, which came to light any time he dealt with Clary or Jace  even with Jocelyn, who he claimed to hate. There were small moments where I found myself feeling sorry for him. I pitied Sebastian. All of this anger and hate, yet youre still searching. Thats a very human reaction. I know a few people like that, except not so hellbent on the destruction of people. Clary constantly struggled with her feelings for Jonathan, her brother and Sebastian, her nemesis. Jace struggled with that damned heavenly fire; Simon with his feelings for Izzy and Alec  who was probably one of the biggest highlights of the book for me  with his relationship or lack thereof with Magnus, as well as his personal philosophy of what the Clave represents. Especially with a Daylighter amongst your closest ranks. Izzy still struggled with Maxs death. I never really realized how much she struggled with it. But its definitely understandable considering how it happened. The romantic relationships continued to grow and develop throughout the book, in spite of a HUGE war at their doorsteps. And I loved that. Dont stop living because of war, life still goes on. From Simons drunken love confession to Magnus inability to keep his lips to himself to Jaces propensity to have condoms while in hell  Cassie thought about her fans when writing this book. There were extremely sad moments, extremely painful moments, extremely angry moments, and extremely happy moments. It was honestly the best emotional roller coaster that Ive been on. I got to fall in love with new characters  Julian and Emma  who were SUCH badasses. I loved them. And Im so happy that theyll be taking us into the next Shadowhunter series, The Dark Artifices. The Downworlders from Raphael to Luke to that damn Seelie Queen were so crucial to the fantastic execution of this book. The final chapter and the epilogue were pure perfection for me. As a TMI fan, I got closure. As a TID fan, I got feels. I honestly felt that everything happened for a reason. And I was fine with it. I was happy. I cried when I turned that final page and closed the book, but I was happy. Id say this was an extremely satisfactory ending to a wellloved series. Cassie loves us her readers and she loves her characters. She did us and them justice. You could FEEL that she thought about us as she wrote this book. Was there enough tragedy in this final installment? My answer to that is: Yes. because death is easy; its living thats hard. And to add onto that, surviving a war and living with those scars the loss of a loved one is one of the most tragic and most difficult things to do. That was apparent in this book. The road to recovery is NOT easy. Cassandra Clare, I hear you. I thank you. I love you. You gave me SIX beautiful books NINE, including TID and I will never be able to repay you. I cant wait to be taken on another fantastic journey into the Shadowhunter world. I am humbled. P.S. I would talk about all the feels I got from seeing my favorite TID characters mingling and interacting with my favorite TMI characters, but that would be a little too much feels for me and Ill talk for ages. Just know that it was EPIC and everything I needed it to be! I LOVED it all!
A stirring romance. A lifechanging adventure. This beautifully woven story is entirely unforgettable, profoundly touching and uniquely Amy Harmon. Its absolute perfection and an immediate alltime favorite. Reading an Amy Harmon book is an experience. I get lost in the story. Consumed by the characters. My thoughts adrift in introspection. The beauty of the writing is always so striking. The story is always so affectingly real. Even in this case, where one of the characters is a music superstar, her sentiments are raw and relatable. Somehow, Amys stories feel stripped and unencumbered, and as a reader, I experience the heart and emotion at the core of the story. I love the pearls of wisdom she embeds and how they incite me to reflect on my own life and actions. Infinity  One is arguably her best work to date and thats saying something since I have loved everything Ive read from her. It has heart and soul, suspense and sexiness, intelligence and wit. Its two seemingly opposite people adding together perfectly. Two souls who have been broken by tragedy and are looking to find their way in life. Its one adventure that promises to change everything and it all starts with a star thats begun to dim... I dont really want to die... I just dont want to live very bad... But maybe that will change if I can just get away for a while... figure out who I am and what I want. To the world, Bonnie Rae Shelby was a bright, shining star. A young girl blazing to the pinnacle of fame. But in reality, Bonnie was broken and empty, lost and impossibly sad. Although she loved music, everything around her was nothing but a mirage. Empty of anything real. And shed had enough. Running from the lights and towards the dark hopelessness she felt inside, she was ready to make it all go away. Until fate intervened, thrusting together a boy with a plan and a girl without hope. Bonnie and Clyde met at the heights of desperation, at a time where they needed something to rouse the insipidity of their lives. Finn saw something hes seen on a thousand faces in the last six and a half years. Beatdown, hopeless, finished, blank. It was a look he had battled in his own reflection. It was defeat. When Finn Clyde came along, Bonnie was forced to make a choice and something about Finn felt right, fated even. Throwing caution to the wind, she takes an uncertain leap into the future with a boy she just met. All she knew is that she had to get away from everything and everyone that caged her in, because the sadness she felt inside had been consuming her for too long. Everybody has the blues. Maybe thats all they are. But they feel more like grays than blues, and more black than gray sometimes. When Bonnie met Clyde, he had a plan. Clyde had seen some of the worst life had to offer, always falling on the wrong side of things. Attracting trouble and taking the consequences. And Bonnie Rae Shelby was trouble. He knew that immediately. But he also recognized the desperation in her... he had felt it so many times. He still felt it. Still searched for an answer that would change the outcome of his life. Clyde saw the world through a different lens. A fabric of fastmoving numbers and equations. He found solace in the mathematics all around him. He could predict conclusions, control the chaos. Having this girl next to him factored an unpredictability that he found difficult to process. I believe in numbers. The ones you can see and the ones you cant. The real and the imaginary, the rational and the irrational, and every point on lines that go on forever. Number have never let me down. They dont waffle. They dont lie. They dont pretend to be what theyre not. Theyre timeless. The more miles they traversed, the more time they spent together, the more they realized just how much they shared in common. They both felt like halves to a whole. They both felt alone. They both needed each other in a way they didnt realize yet. Seeing how their differences began to converge and fit together was wonderful to observe. Every moment seemed significant as they gradually fell for each other. Depended on each other. Needed each other. Bonnies fog began to lift and Finn suddenly saw a girl full of feistiness and courage, life and song. She was courageous and beautiful and she did something unsettling to him inside. Finn felt as if he was permanently marked in a way that was never going to be good... or good enough. He couldnt figure out why Bonnie didnt run from him, and perhaps more significantly, why he suddenly couldnt fathom being away from her. He was usually good at figuring things out, good at unraveling complicated equations and ferreting out solutions to problems most people wouldnt even attempt. But that was math and Bonnie was a woman, and the functions and formulas that ruled one had no obvious bearing on the other. Here he was, surrounded by a complex, puzzling, and illusive problem, and he wasnt talking about math. Bonnie should be running from him as far and fast as she could, and for the life of him he couldnt figure her out. Bonnie wasnt good at being alone. She kept searching for something real and Finn Clyde was real, beautiful and brilliant. He was caring and good, but he too, was broken. Bonnie began to believe that they were destined to meet, a duo on the run, like the famous Bonnie and Clyde, but with the possibility of a different ending. A happy one. She needed Finn to believe in her, in them, in himself... but he feared they couldnt escape the same illfated ending, and he feared he would lose her and it would all be on him. Were Bonnie and Clyde! Wanted and unwanted. Caged and cornered. Were lost and were alone. Were a big tangled mess. Were a shot in the dark. Were two people who have nowhere else, no one else, and yet, suddenly that feels like enough for me! This beautiful, powerful, unforgettable story is one about breaking the cycle of hopelessness. Its about taking control of your own life and risking it all to find the things that are most worth it in life. Its love and adventure, risk and reward, courage and freedom. Its a spellbinding tale that touched my heart profoundly, yet quietly, in the way that Amy Harmon often has through her storytelling. I find that I care deeply for the characters she creates, feeling their emotions as if they were my own, internalizing the stories to a point where they mean so much to me. Infinity  One is breathtaking... undeniably one of my favorite alltimes reads. Youll fall in love with Bonnie and Clyde, rooting for their love as they race towards their happy ever after. Infinity plus one does equal two... Me and you.
Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog Passenger by Alexandra Bracken Book One of the Passenger series Publisher: DisneyHyperion Publication Date: January 5, 2016 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC sent by the publisher Summary from Goodreads: passage, n. i. A brief section of music composed of a series of notes and flourishes. ii. A journey by water; a voyage. iii. The transition from one place to another, across space and time. In one devastating night, violin prodigy Etta Spencer loses everything she knows and loves. Thrust into an unfamiliar world by a stranger with a dangerous agenda, Etta is certain of only one thing: she has traveled not just miles but years from home. And shes inherited a legacy she knows nothing about from a family whose existence shes never heard of. Until now. Nicholas Carter is content with his life at sea, free from the Ironwoodsa powerful family in the coloniesand the servitude hes known at their hands. But with the arrival of an unusual passenger on his ship comes the insistent pull of the past that he cant escape and the family that wont let him go so easily. Now the Ironwoods are searching for a stolen object of untold value, one they believe only Etta, Nicholas passenger, can find. In order to protect her, he must ensure she brings it back to them whether she wants to or not. Together, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the traveler who will do anything to keep the object out of the Ironwoods grasp. But as they get closer to the truth of their search, and the deadly game the Ironwoods are playing, treacherous forces threaten to separate Etta not only from Nicholas but from her path home . . . forever What I Liked: This book has so much buzz surrounding it, which can be good and bad. I loved Brackens Brightly Woven, and Darkest Minds series, and I had a good feeling that I would enjoy this one too. Its just scary when everyone is really excited about reading the book, very few people have actually read it, and you so want it to be amazing! Lucky for me and others, it WAS amazing. Ettas next concern is her violinist debut, which shell perform in a month or so. Shes performing in the Met, where her mother works, when she is suddenly whisked away in time, accompanied by a strange girl who was also at the met. Sophia Ironwood, the girl, is a traveler, and so is Etta. Sophias grandfather, the Grand Master and head of the Ironwood family, has had Etta brought back in time because he wants her to find something that he says her mother stole from him. If she brings it back, hell let her and her mother go. But Etta  and Nicholas Carter, who commandeered the ship that Etta had to be on to get to Grandfather Ironwood  wont let Ironwood win so easily. Nicholas and Etta will travel between continents and time to find the missing object before anyone else does. Im going to be honest  Im struggling to write this review, because I know I wont do this book justice. I know Im giving it four stars 4.5 stars, really, but gosh, this book was lovely. Its written in thirdperson which I love, occasionally alternating POVs, between Etta and Nicholas. We start with Nicholas, in the beginning of the book, which I thought was interesting. Nicholas dreams of owning his own ship preferably SHIPS, and freeing himself from the Ironwood family. Once you get caught in their web, they never let you go  but Nicholas is hoping that this last trip will be his last for them. Carry two women to New York safely, and hes free. But Nicholas has good instincts, and knows something is not quite right, when Etta is confused and lost and has no idea what she is. Nicholas is such an eighteenthcentury gentleman  protective, loyal, strongwilled, stubborn, wellmannered  but he is also so much more. His past and his connections with Ironwood haunt him in ways that I wont mention, but its so sad to see how people treat him. I really like Etta as well  her first appearance on the ship was PERFECT. We meet her in presentday America, when she is about to play in the Met. Shes a violin prodigy, but shes about to discover that she is also a timetraveler, and that her mother kept a whole lot from her. On the ship in the eighteenthcentury, Etta is confused and doesnt know what is happening, and immediately jumps to defend herself something you wouldnt see from an eighteenthcentury lady. Everyone on the ship falls for her  but especially Nicholas, who doesnt leave her side, when she meets Ironwood, when Ironwood tells her his terms and threats, when Etta leaves and tries to escape... Nicholas and Etta agree to journey together across time, and probably for the better, because Etta is not a good traveler. This story was so interesting! Filled with different countries and times, we got to experience a whole range of settings. Bracken really did her research, and every scene felt fresh and unique and different. The jungle one was probably my favorite, as it was a lush setting, but also really defined Nicholas and Ettas relationship they are so funny!. They have days to find the mysterious object and bring it back for Ironwood, and so they follow clues that Ettas mother left her over time. The clues take them to many places, and Nicholas and Etta get to know each other. The romance... ahh, it was beautiful. Nicholas is different from Brackens other male protagonists, like a combination of Liam and North. Hes bossy and manly yet gentlemanly and chivalrous. And Etta is like a flame or a constant spark. I loved the relationship growth, how they grew with and into each other, how things developed. This book is nearly five hundred pages long, so you can bet that there is a lot of character development AND romance development. The romance is very slowburn, although the interest in each other happens quickly. The climax of this story was so enthralling, heartpounding, and terrifying! This book ends on a cliffhanger, which made me very sad but also quite hopeful. The cliffhanger is kind of a devastating one, but you know its going to be not as bad as you think because of a few lines in the very end. Suffice it to say, I NEED Wayfarer, immediately. This ending was cruel! What I Did Not Like: I think the ending is what is docking this books star or halfstar, really. Its a cliffhanger, and a brutal one, at that. Prepare your hearts, readers! And I GUARANTEE you, its not the ending you might be thinking of. I would never have come up with this ending  and Im usually pretty good at predicting endings, before getting more than halfway into the book. This cliffhanger though! Would I Recommend It: I SO recommend this book! Im not usually a fan of timetravel novels  I did LOVE the Ruby Red series by Kerstin Gier  but this book was excellent. The timetravel is a bit different, as is the aim of the story. I cant wait to see how everything ignites in Wayfarer  the ending of this book was cruel in several ways. You dont have to be a timetravel or historical fiction to love this book! Rating: 4.5 stars  rounded down to 4 stars. Such a gorgeous cover, AND a wonderful story  you must preorder this book! Definitely buy or borrow a copy, you do not want to miss this novel. The hype and buzz is totally justified! Now, someone bring me the sequel, please. PLEASE.
Initial Impressions 71416: This book has killed me with cute. Goodbye. No, but really. I identified SO much with these characters  not in family sense but in personality. I may not be as coolly quirky as Lily but Im such an awkward mess sometimes and I love the sincerity of it all. The hate to love was PERFECT and I loved the true meaning behind everything. This book was so, so wonderful and it gave me all the feels. I just really connected with these characters and everything was wonderful. Full review as originally posted HERE on The Book Addicts Guide 72516:  SLIGHT spoiler in the sense that Im revealing who mystery notewriter is later on in my review. Its necessary in order to properly share swoons. You can probably guess as you read but if you dont want to know, avert your eyes!  Kasie West is one of my queens of contemporary. When Im in the mood for a contemporary novel, I usually lean towards light and fun especially lately so as soon as I heard about new title P.S. I LIKE YOU from Kasie West, I was ALL over that. A new cute contemporary novel from Kasie AND a secret letter exchange? Oh, boy. It had my name written all over it. All of Kasie Wests novels are amazing so its hard for me to pick a favorite... and P.S. I LIKE YOU made it that much harder. It was good right from the start but I wasnt sure it was new favorite material. I immediately adored Lily and her quirky, unique, and notafraidtobethemselves family but I wasnt sure I could really relate as much as I had to previous novels like ON THE FENCE swoon. The more I got to know Lily and her family, the more relatable they became. I really, really loved how Kasie West showed how Lily was comfortable with who she was for example, in fashion sense and music taste and yet she was still shy and uncomfortable to be so different at times. She had such a conviction in what she loved and yet she felt vulnerable about those things as well. Theres so much going on in one persons life that its impossible to tell why they do, dress, or act how they do. Lily has a unique clothing style and makes her own clothes. Its a passion and art is important in her family but it also stems from the fact that her parents cant afford to buy herself new clothes and all of Lilys money usually goes towards her guitar or hanging out with her friends. I cant say how much I appreciated that Kasie West portrayed a character who was happy with her creations and art and was still so selfconscious of them at the same time. I loved seeing two present parents for the main character as well. I suppose its more common in fantasydystopianparanormal to have a noticeable lack of adults around but I always appreciate seeing two loving parents in a YA characters life. I suppose part of the reason parents are so often absent because of divorce or death in YA novels is probably because that is a major thing for a teen to deal with but its also nice to have novels where you get to see a family with two parents who have a good relationship. Im not saying one is better than the other but when it becomes a noticeable tend in YA to have missing parents, its refreshing to see the opposite... But thats a discussion for another day. What I loved best about Lilys family was how supportive everyone was of each other. The kids ages range from 8  19 so theres a wide array of sports schedules, practices, friends, places to be, and things to do among all the kids. Sometimes Lily has to grudgingly babysit but you can always see the love there for her younger brothers and even though she and her sister are different in many ways and can butt heads, theyre always looking out for each other when it comes to the big picture. Her parents can be a bit embarrassing but in ways that show that they care about their kids and like to have fun. Its typical silly parents behavior that can embarrass a teenager but I loved how I could just feel the love from the whole family! And of course there were the SWOONS. This is the part where you avert your eyes if you dont want to know who the mystery notewriter is! I absolutely adored the romance in this book. First off, the letter writing reminded me SO MUCH of some of my high school experiences. We used to exchange notes back and forth all the time in classes in high school. I think I even still have the box of notes that I kept from high school somewhere you know, if I ever want to relive those embarrassing worldsshortestrelationships and memories of many, many text and instant message conversations with crushes. The beauty of this book was the hatetolove relationship. Oh yes, Im talking about how Lilys mortal enemy 1 Cade ends up becoming the love interest. It was done so well because I spent the first half of the book suspecting the notewriter might be him he was the prominent male character even in the first half of the book and wondering how in the world he was going to be turned around into someone I would actually like and it so worked. Everything that Cade did and said truly had a reason behind it and it just goes to show you that you never know whats going on in someone elses life and where theyre coming from. The characters really reminded me of myself and some things I had gone through during high school and it also just makes me wonder what sort of things I was missing in other peoples lives because I was too absorbed in my own. I wont spoil everything here but I will say that these swoons just totally took me by surprise and this relationship ended up being amazingly cute. When the reveal happened and these two characters came together... GAH. I just melted. Not to be missed in the midst of the swoons was the friendship between Lily and Isabel. They come from a totally different family life, like plenty of different things, and enjoy different hobbies but theyre still best friends. Although a lot of people find friends based on similar interests, not ALL of their interests have to intersect and I really liked that about this friendship! The girls are different in many ways but theyre so supportive of each other no matter what, even when a boy threatens to come between them. Gasp! Never! I just loved the maturity of their friendship and also how it continues to grow throughout the book. Lily often has to take care of family matters before hanging out with friends and especially as a teenager that can be hard to understand but the girls end up making it work and hang out when they can. I love that by the end of the book, they understand each other even more than they already did and learned a little something about themselves too. P.S. I LIKE YOU definitely shot straight into my favorites from Kasie West! Although isnt that really all of them? Dont make me choose! The beginning started off a little slower for me than previous books but the middle and ending were ohsorewarding and just so darn cute. Kasie West never fails to deliver a cute contemporary and characters that are so incredibly relatable. She continues to be an autobuy author for me and even though I just finished this book, I cant wait for more!!
Achingly real. Deeply Affecting. Emotionally Turbulent. A story about friendship and loyalty, suppressing feelings and relinquishing to feelings... about desire that burns and a love that consumes... about the magic of music and the enduring hope of maybe someday. Another unforgettable experience from Colleen Hoover. 6 stars!!! There are only twentysix letters in the English alphabet. You would think there would only be so much you could do with twentysix letters. You would think there were only so many ways those letters could make you feel when mixed up and shoved together to make words. However, there are infinite ways those twentysix letters can make a person feel... And this story is living proof. I use the authors own words to describe my own experience. How is it possible to make simple words incite so much emotion? Make me feel so much? Within the span of these 320 pages, I felt betrayal. Anger. Hope. Confusion. Desire. Love. I was moved to tears. And at times, I was honestly scared. Colleen Hoover puts us in some uncomfortable spots, making me uncertain on how I would feel in the end. Would I be happy? Was there a true right and wrong? Does that even exist when love fuels the choices we make? The pages of this story were brimming with feeling... often times stirring up a fury of emotion that crushed me and antagonized me, while at the same time thrilled me with the reverie of the kind of love that consumes... that finally breathes relief upon meeting its soul mate. And in addition to a beautifully crafted narrative, its power is intensified with the richness of another dimension. The story roared to life through the voice of Griffin Peterson. I felt every word. Every moment. And if it werent already certain, Colleen Hoover has once again proven herself to be a master storyteller, weaving a story with words that are deceptively simple and characters that are nothing less than unforgettable. Are you in the mood to make beautiful music together? Sydney Blake is content. Shes got a great boyfriend, a great roommate, a great job and a growing love of music. Despite some disappointing parents and a pestering hesitation at taking her relationship to the next level, life is good. In addition, shes found some unexpected joy listening to a talented and mysterious neighbor who plays his guitar each night. Sounds curling across the courtyard to ignite her passion. Melodies to inspire her. Lyrics unleashed to paper. But everything falls apart on her twentysecond birthday when she realizes her boyfriend and best friend are having an affair. Luckily fate intervenes and she finds herself thrust closer to her captivating neighbor. I never expected my twentysecond birthday to end with me showering in a strange apartment and sleeping on a couch that belongs to a guy Ive barely known for two weeks, all at the hands of the two people I cared about and trusted the most. Heartbroken and homeless, Sydney finds comfort in her time with Ridge, all the while learning the depth of his talents despite some irremediable impediments. When Ridge makes a hardtorefuse proposition, they begin to write music together. Her words, his melody, side by side, night by night as their lives begin to entwine. Each set of lyrics becoming more personal as a connection between them forms, grows and intensifies... pulling them together. Closer. Theres something about these moments when were writing music that I absolutely love. All my worries and thoughts about everything wrong in my life seem to go away for the short times we write together. I really loved both of them individually. One of the aspects I love most about this authors characters is that they always have such big, altruistic hearts. Sydney is so selfless and good. Shes witty and talented and before too long, she finds herself falling for Ridge. Ridge is incredibly talented. Hes a survivor... a surprisingly good and healthy outcome of a childhood marred by ugliness, alcoholism and hate. Hes loyal to a fault with an unfailing drive to protect others. With Sydney, however, he finds a very real connection, an ease, a magic... an intense need to be with her. Despite how hard we tried to fight it, all of those things happened between us because our feelings for each other are becoming so much stronger than our desire. Desire is easy to fight. Especially when the only weapon desire possesses is attraction. Its not so easy when youre trying to win a war against the heart. There are truths, however, circumstances that cannot be denied that push them apart. For the good of others, they must squash, bury and forget their feelings for each other. And as a reader, my heart broke for the rightness of their togetherness, but I simultaneously felt conflicted by the goodness of their intentions given the impossible situation. In my opening thoughts, I said that the story was emotionally turbulent and what I meant by that is that I felt so many feelings at war within me as the scenes unfurled on the pages. Lines are drawn, but then they fade. For her I bend, for you I break. As they both battle their emotions, the power to deny them becomes impossible and the socalled lines they drawn blur as their actions become instinctive...a need for relief more powerful than their good intentions. The story, which is told through an alternating Ridge and Sydney pointofview does an amazing job at helping us to understand their thoughts and feelings, deepening the connection I had with them as characters, so when reality brutally severs hope, I was shattered. I did have a little hope. Although I wasnt ready for anything right now, I thought the possibility would be there. I assumed that maybe someday, when I was ready, things could have developed between us. However... I realize there cant be a maybe someday between us. There will never be a maybe someday. As the story comes to its natural climax I honestly thought... heck, here it is... one of my favorite authors may finally falter. The looming end seemed too murky and unresolved. But its her adept skill at taking us to uncomfortable places, having us wallow in the throes of uncertainty, then somehow ordering things in a way where the impossible becomes possible and the unrightable finally feels right, well it makes the payoff all the sweeter, all the more powerful. This book was just beautiful and real and everything I hope to experience upon the first flip of any storys page. Furthermore, the added richness of the music made it all feel so alive. Special. Intimate. I love the fact that this author continues to push herself in each of her books. That even at the top of her game, I continue to see growth and innovation with each new release. Whether it be a novel way to format chapters to maximize impact or in this case, adding an unexpected dimension to heighten emotion, Colleen Hoover has simply become one of the most exciting authors to read. I anxiously await her next book, Ugly Love later this year. For more reviews, connect with me: Vilmas Book Blog  Facebook  Twitter
6 Stars!!! In love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are. WOW...Just WOW! This is one BEAUTIFUL book. Ive got ugly tears running down my face right now. I just love this quote and it beautifully and succinctly summarizes this book. For almost a year, Ive heard so much buzz about this book, but somehow I couldnt get myself to read it...maybe because of the historical background. Well, there is a lot of war in this book, but this book is so much more than war. This is a story about humanity and how far we will go to save a stranger. It is a story about family and love. It is an empowering story about the inner strength and endurance of women. It is HEARTWRENCHING! It looks at society and how peoples fear can cloud sound judgment. It asks the hard questions of how far will we go to protect our loved ones? How much can we take before we break? This book follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, and their struggles during World War II. Although sisters, they are not friends. Abandoned by their father at an early age, both struggle to find love, acceptance, and their place in life. As the war comes to France, Vianne and Isabelle find their strength and learn to survive the war. They both grow throughout the process and make their mark on the war. Im not a history buff, but after reading this novel and knowing that Kristin Hannah was inspired by true stories, I am completely in awe and want to learn more about this time period. This book is so wonderful and I have so many emotions running through me right now. Im not sure how to write this review. I guess Ill just tell you about how this book will make you feel and what I hope youll gain from this book. Ill be honest...it took me awhile to really get into the book. Dont get me wrong, the entire book is good, but I wasnt hooked until about 30 so keep reading if you are unsure about this book. At this point I just became so invested in their story and what it must have been like to live through WWII. I was so engrossed in the story; I was emotionally in sync with Vianne and Isabelle. I felt myself trudging along and trying to be strong just like Vianne and Isabelle. Only until the end did I relax and allow myself to grieve for all of their loss. Im grieving and reminiscing on their journey. It is now at the end of the book that I can fully appreciate this story and all the beauty and wisdom it has to offer. Vianne and Isabelle are very different characters. Isabelle is naive, impetuous, and freespirited. In contrast, Vianne is older, wiser, and more responsible and cautious in life. However, both sisters are insecure and flawed in their own way. Each sister takes their own path in the war. Both have their own crises and question ethics, morals, and how to live a meaningful life. They make mistakes, hurt people, and they are both pushed to their breaking pointthey find out who they really are and what they are willing to sacrifice to make a better world. Their growth is beautiful to watch. I could only hope I would do the same in their situation. Dont think about who they are. Think about who you are and what sacrifices you can live with and what will break you. I found myself liking Isabelle more than Vianne which is interesting since I am more like Vianne in real life. I admired Isabelle so much. Her strength and courage was amazing. But as Vianne began to grow and mature, I really started to like her character as well. It was a proud moment when she realizes what she must to do live with herself in the war. She knew now that no one could be neutralnot anymoreand as afraid as she was of risking Sophies life, she was suddenly more afraid of letting her daughter grow up in a world where good people did nothing to stop evil, where a good woman could turn her back on a friend in need. There are so many wonderful messages and lessons in this book. How do we pick up the pieces and move on from such terror? How do we survive such hate? How do we overcome such evil? But love has to be stronger than hate, or there is no future for us. This story emphasizes that our ability to love is one of the most powerful forces. Love keeps the spirit alive. It has the potential to heal, to build and rebuild the future for us. It emphasizes the strength in us women and how we piece it all together and move the future along. It makes me so proud to be a woman. They couldnt touch my heart. They couldnt change who I was inside. My body...they broke that in the first days, but not my heart, V. The story also touches on our need for love and belonging. Isabelle, Vianne, and their father have a strained relationship. No matter how much they try to resist needing one another, their bond and need to be loved by one another is strong and everlasting. A girls love for her father. Immutable. Unbearable but unbreakable. Its a story that emphasizes forgiveness, to live in the moment, and to appreciate and love one another while we are alive. The story has tragedy pervading every scene. Its a realistic story of grief and loss. I like happy endings because I know in life sometimes there are no happy endings. Books are my escape. This story doesnt have a bad ending, just a realistic one that breaks my heart. Some stories dont have happy endings. Even love stories. Maybe especially love stories. However, despite all the loss and grief, there is a silver lining. While the book reminds us that even though not all endings are happy, the life lived and how we lived is what matters. Its the memories and the love found that carry us through. I know now what matters, and it is not what I have lost. It is my memories. Wounds heal. Love lasts. This book will touch your heart and soul. It will make you want to be strong. It will make you feel proud to be a woman. It will make you want to love harder and be better. It is a story of strength, love, courage, and sacrifice. This is a MUST read!!
Initial Reactions 2214:I cant decide between 3 and 4 stars. It was enjoyable. It was quick. But I saw it coming about 20 in so it was a bit anticlimactic for me. I think I would have loved it if I hadnt know it was a twist ending. If someone tells you theres a twist and when it happens, even if you dont know what it is, doesnt that take out all the fun? Instead of being surprised, I was looking for the twist and I found it early on. Updated three hours later: Yep, Im confident in 3 stars. It was enjoyable and quick and I actually read it in one sitting because I was so desperate to finish. I just didnt feel like the twist was anything new and I predicted it too easily. Im not saying that this is an unsatisfactory book AT ALL. I just have to rate it how I feel because it wasnt the stellar, mindblowing read for me. I can totally see how it knocked peoples socks off, but I was not one of those. Review originally posted on The Book Addicts Guide 42514: My review for WE WERE LIARS is a complicated thing to write. Obviously we know from all of the chatter so far that theres an interesting twist to this book and unfortunately, the chatter somehow spoiled the book for me without even talking about specific spoilers. Before I get into that, let me explain a bit more first. The narration of WE WERE LIARS is interesting but at times a bit confusing to me. The main character, Cady, suffers from unbearable migraines after an accident she suffered two years ago at her familys beach house and she cant remember the details of the accident. To make matters more complicated, no one will tell her what happened either. Cadys approach to filling the reader in is obviously limited. She has selective amnesia from the accident so the reader is very much attempting to discover what exactly happened with Cadys accident right along side her. I didnt find the lack of information confusing but one thing I did wish is that we had just a few more clues earlier on in the story. I didnt really pick up on anything to sort of help push me along to really wrap me up in the mystery. I understand being in the dark so the reveal to Cady is just as much of a shock to the reader, but with all of the hype around the surprising ending thats no spoiler  the buzz around the blogosphere is that the ending is one to die for!, the reveal was a bit TOO much information all at once. I really think the book could have benefitted from just tiny clues here and there because honestly? If I hadnt already known there was a twist coming, I may not have continued reading or it would have taken me a lot longer to finish. Im a sucker for a twist. I absolutely love being surprised and when I heard this book had a killer ending, I was so excited to read it, especially with all of the amazing feedback out there but... the hype monster totally got me on this one. Its a tricky situation when you hear a book has a fantastic twist. Thats not a spoiler, right? You cant fault anyone for saying a book has a twist because naturally people are wanting to discuss it and without saying what that twist is, no one is really spoiling the book. For me, hearing that WE WERE LIARS had a twisty ending inadvertently spoiled the book just a little bit for me. I never read any specifics but when I hear a book has a twist, what do I do? I go looking for it and guess what. I found it. About a quarter of the way through. I actually had a second guess later on the book which was the wrong one but that kept me on my toes trying to guess if it was one of the two possible outcomes I had surmised. I was actually kind of hoping I was wrong so I would be totally surprised but I did enjoy it... It just didnt knock me off my feet since I was able to see it coming. As much as I REALLY want to discuss the reasons how I spotted it, obviously I cant do that so I dont spoil it for you guys! : I did enjoy the ending. It didnt knock my socks off, as previously stated, but its a concept I really love and enjoy and totally commend authors for pulling off. That being said, I was also a bit disappointed with it at the same time. Again, for spoiler reasons, I wont delve into why I was disappointed, but if youve already read the book, Id love to discuss! If you havent read, no, I will not tell you how this ends! The other pro and con of this book for me was the length. I really appreciated being able to be swept away by this book in one sitting on a Sunday morning with the book at just under 250 pages Goodreads currently locks it in at 240 and with all of the hefty books on my TBR, I always appreciate reading a shorter one! At the same time, I feel like this book could have benefitted a little from a few more pages. I appreciated the characters but felt they could have been a little bit more developed. I dont think I ever understood exactly how the group of teens had come to be called the Liars. I could have used even a few sentences to a paragraph of tiny, tiny clues in the beginning or middle to keep me invested in the story. I would have liked to see the romance between Cady and Gat developed a little bit more. I really liked being able to finish this book so quickly but there were still quite a few things that I felt the book could have benefitted from in those extra pages. So what can I possibly say for this book at the end of this review? READ IT. I hope youre one of the people who is truly blown away and just entangled in the mystery of this book. I had a few qualms about it and probably my biggest issues was that I sort of ended up spoiling it for myself, but it really was interesting and jarring.
From:  The Good Read Hard and Put Away Wet... Okay, I have been sitting her for 10 minutes and I still dont know what to write. I guess it is fitting since Divergent left me speechless. How do I write a review about a book like this? A book that revitalized me, a book that made me bite my nails for the first time in 3 years, a book that ripped out my heart and made me want more. My face actually hurts from the emotions I went through. Ive been caught smiling like an idiot, crying like a wuss, laughing to near hysteria, and waving my hands around from nervousness all while reading Divergent. I swear I found a new wrinkle between my eyes because I read this book so HARD. You ever do that? Reading a book hard is when you squeeze the cover from anxiety, rip the pages in your haste to see what happens next, and having to actually get up and stand while you finish a scene because of your nervous energy. Oh yeah, everyone in my household knows that if I am reading standing up then that book is the BOMB! Dont laugh because I used the word Bomb, I am totally bringing it back. Choose a Faction... Beatrice lives in a world where one of five virtues dictates the rest of a persons life. Once someone turns 16, they must decide which faction virtue they will live with the rest of their lives. You have a choice between Candor the honest, Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Amity the peaceful, and Erudite the intelligent, but once a faction is chosen, there is no turning back. That faction is your family, your only family. Beatrice loves her family, but she struggles with the choice of staying with them within a faction that no longer suits her or going with the faction that has fascinated and called to her most of her life. Finally gaining the courage, she leaves her family, joins a new faction, and renames herself Tris. But the hard part is not over yet. Tris must now survive the horrifying training process, cruel initiates, and political intrigue that might just bring destruction upon the faction system. Tris... I dont think this book would have been the same without Tris. It is her that takes us on a journey of selfdiscovery, the concept of virtues, and the trials one must go through to be accepted. Her struggles between being selfless, brave, and intelligent at the same time were captivating. Its hard for her to be just one, but she knows showing signs of too many virtues can get her killed. She was so meek and small in the beginning that her surviving the training seemed impossible. However, she was like a blooming flower in the sun, the more she was exposed to the life of her new faction, the more she became stronger, resilient, and flourished in her new surroundings. I think any of us could look up to Tris not literally, that girl is short as all getout. She never gave up no matter how much she was hurting or felt unwanted. I Am Number Four... Four is the kind of person youll love and hate through most of the novel. Hes a bit mysterious, somewhat caring, and a whole lot intimidating. He goes through these moods. One day hes as sweet as pie, then the next he is nicking your ear with a knife true story. But underneath his mood swings, he has a heart that beats for Tris. His goal is to help her survive the new cutthroat world she has been thrust into, even if that means being her enemy from time to time. I liked finding out about Four in short bursts of emotion. His background and his true motives stay a mystery for a good chunk of the novel. Of course, this made him all the more interesting. Its the End of the World as We Know It... The concept behind Divergent is undeniably frightening and intriguing at the same time. In this dystopian world, war has been eradicated by simply cultivating the best virtues that any human being can poses. But in Divergent they have separated these traits into factions that live apart. The problem is, acting in accordance to one virtue does not guarantee a peaceful society. Eliminating peoples innate kindness or mercy to be brave or doing away with a conscious selfworth to be solely selfless leaves people open to attack on many fronts. What makes us human is the ability to experience all that life has to offer; to be brave when its necessary or honest when its appropriate. To focus on only one part of yourself can warp your ideals into something dangerous. That is whats happening in the world of Divergent. Factions are being corrupted. And if the one faction meant to protect you is unraveling, what do you do? Maybe, just maybe, Tris and her uniqueness will be able to fix what has taken place and find a way to triumph over the darkness in the world. I guess we shall see as the trilogy goes on. A Punch in the Gut... I was shocked by the direction this book took. We do not get a happy endingat least not yet. The initiation Tris goes through was nerveracking on its own, and then Roth decides to punch us in the gut by bringing the world down around our ears. It was a nice surprise because it only made me want to read book 2, Insurgent, even more. The plot was well structured, the pacing perfect, and the suspense was phenomenal. I was terrified for Tris most of the time. I felt her emotions as she struggled to become what her faction required. The fear of her fellow cruel initiates was a constant throughout the book. The betrayals against Tris hit me just as hard as her. The astronomical changes in her left me out of breath and craving more. Every multidimensional characterthe bad guys, the good guys, and the inbetweenerscontributed to this amazing story. Roths ability to write such outstanding fiction at her young age gives me hope as a young writer myself. The Bad The only thing that bugged me was when Tris forgave people that I think were unforgivable. There was some major backstabbing in the book, and no matter what happened to those people, I wouldve never forgiven them. But maybe Im just pigheaded. The Snuggly The romance is pretty minor. It takes quite some time for Tris and Four to get together. I like the fact that Tris is not very attractive but Four likes her because of her strength and determination. It gave their relationship a solid foundation because they grew to respect each other first. Id say the book is pretty clean except for some unwanted sexual touching. Overall I actually have Insurgent on the way to my house right now. I couldnt wait to read book2, and since it took me so long to read Divergent, I didnt have to wait but a couple of days. Roth did an amazing job of taking captivating characters and a kickass and compassionate heroine, throwing them into a terrifying world, and adding just enough political corruption, action, and drama to produce one hell of a read. This is not the kind of book you can pass up. Any adult or young adult out there will fall in love with Divergent. Its a must read! Excerpt I hear the crash of water against rocks. We are near the chasmwe must be above it, given the volume of the sound. I press my lips together to keep from screaming. If we are above the chasm, I know what they intend to do to me. Lift her up, cmon. I thrash, and their rough skin grates against mine, but I know its useless. I scream too, knowing that no one can hear me here. I will survive until tomorrow, I will. The hands push me around and up and slam my spine into something hard and cold. Judging by its width and curvature, it is a metal railing. It is the metal railing, the one that overlooks the chasm. My breaths wheeze and mist touches the back of my neck. The hands force my back to arch over the railing. My feet leave the ground, and my attackers are the only thing keeping me from falling into the water.
I dont recall a time before that I have felt so deeply a part of a fictional universe than I did as I read Laini Taylors Strange the Dreamer. This book is for anyone who dreams, hides away in their imagination, and feels distaste for reality because of its translucence. Its rare that I could feel at the same time a part of the story as well as a reader. With vivid descriptions and sensual passages that arouse the senses, Strange the Dreamer causes one to reflect on reading itself. As readers we are constantly reminded of the reasons why we are readers, why we daydream, and why we prefer the story world to the real world. This book is a masterpiece of fantastical realism with a twist of romance which I feel will one day become a classic, earning its spot alongside the Harry Potter and Twilight series. Lazlo Strange is just as his name insinuates, strange. He is a war orphan whose birth and origins are unknown. He is brought up by a group of stale and dry monks in the city of Zosma. By age twenty is a junior librarian. He is infatuated with tails of Weep, or as he likes to call, the Unseen City. He is rarely seen without a book in his hand or his eyes elsewhere than hidden inside the ancient pages of books recounting the stories of Weep. He has spent seven of his youthful years studying this lost city and learning its language. It is not until the Godslayer comes to Zosma in search of assistants to help him give Weep back its sunlight that Lazlos dreams may just become possible after all. Finally, this faraway land that Lazlo has met only in his dreams becomes something greater, perhaps even something greater than himself. What awaits him in the city remains a mystery and it is not until the moon glows in the sky, lays his head down to rest in the Godslayers room, and loses himself in a lucid slumber that he discovers the truth shadowing over Weep. We slowly learn the magnitude of the anathemas hiding within the city. Forces of magic, hatred, and sacrifice turned Weep, many years ago, into a city in despair, haunted by nightmares, spirits, and ghostly secrets. On the ground are the humans who suffer the memories of bloodshed and corruption left behind by the gods while up above, in a citadel hovering over the city are four young survivors, godspawn, as well as a number of ghosts tending to their needs. As the novel progresses reality blurs into dreams and dreams become just as inescapably real as daylight itself. The dangers Lazlos confronts are both complex and enigmatically portrayed. There is so much imagery and eloquent descriptions describing Weep that I feel as though I could accurately paint a picture of the city without doing injustice towards Taylors imagination. I felt myself immersed and becoming one with the story, sometimes perceiving the city from Lazlos perspective, and sometimes from one of the godspawns, Sarais. Its always such a delight to fall into a story the way I did with Strange the Dreamer. When I read I lost touch with reality and, for the moment, only knew of Weep and the fictional world. The romance that blossoms between Lazlo and Sarai is gentle and precious  two young people who are innocent in the games of love, but somehow immediately are aware that they are in love with each other. Sarai, or should we call her the Muse of Nightmares meets Lazlo in his dreams. They begin a kindling romance that is confined to the moonlit hours, held together by moths, and ended when the sun rises and Sarai must return up above to the citadel until the following night. Together, Lazlo and Sarai share a power that could possibly put an end to what lies at the core of the citys collapse: hatred. Each dream of a time where the godspawn can live amongst the humans without being killed on site. All seems possible...in Lazlos dreams. However, as the story progresses we soon realizes that while dreams and reality do overlap, they still remain invariably opposite from one another. If there is one thing I am to criticize but only briefly about this novel is the complexity and effort that it takes to follow each and every vital situation. For example, Sarai lives in the citadel with three other godspawn: Minya, Sparrow, and Feral. Aside from the happenings down below concerning Lazlo and the Godslayer theres just as much conflict passing between these four. The novel alternating perspectives several time in order to account for what occurs in Lazlos world and that which occurs in Sarais. This is all fine and dandy, but at times I felt myself a bit lost and quite overwhelmed. Theres a lot going on in this novel just concerning the mystery of Weep that I feel as though all the drama and chapters which zeroin on the lives of the godspawns was rather unnecessary and altogether distracting. But then again, thats only what my personal experience reading was like; Im sure most readers loved the multifaceted plottwists with many stories blurring into others. Lazlo was my absolute favorite character, and given that Im an avid reader and roundtheclock daydreamer, it simple to see why. He lives vicariously through the stories he hears as well as the ones he tells. Through Lazlos character Taylor wondrously illustrates how it is not simply the wise or most well off of men who succeed but those who think with their hearts and follow their dreams will discover. His infatuation with a city he only knows through myths leads him into a journey that will change his life beyond all logical reasoning, for, this book is not about rationality at all. Its about dreams and what happens when dreams become fused with reality. Taylors writing style is poetic, but lengthy. Although the narrative moves slowly and their are several times in which the story is paused just to muse on a characters sleeping position, I never felt as though the story was just dragging on. There were so many beautiful standalone sentences on each of these pages that I often found myself repeating the same sentence to myself over and over again just because of how harmonic it sounded. Her descriptions of her characters are magical, realistic, and somehow utterly relatable. These characters can steal rain from other cities, step into each others dreams, bottle spirit in a vial, and even give life to gardens. Plot twist after plot twist had me reading day and night, in anticipation of which of the delegates would bring back Weeps sunlight and where Lazlos future was headed: alongside Sarai or alone? Taylor captures the very soul of humanity with her thought provoking approach to her characters. Underlying this magical tales she confronts themes such as hatred and identity. Does hatred win? Is identity determined by birth or by upbringing? I really enjoyed the way the author explored these themes without taking the enchantment away from the narrative. Taylors splendid prose won me over from the very first page. The fluidity of her words melted from the page and made their way into my heart. This is one of those books that I will tuck away in my mind and will always be a part of me. Dreams, stories, books, mythical creatures, magic  this book is all I could hope for and more. Whether or not one is a fantasy, young adult, or even nonfiction reader I believe that Strange the Dreamer is for readers of all genres. There is so much to take away from and give to this book. Taylor describes the fictional world with so much imagery but not too much as to leave the reader without opportunity of imagination. The novels plot, characters, and writing bring together an imagination that may perhaps indeed be real. We are brought into an intriguing world where noting is how it seems on the surface, but then again is even more deceptive in the dream world. With a stark ending that leaves one hanging, because this story was not over yet, Taylor has created a masterpiece novel that has been loved and shared, just like magic. She is definitely an author that I recommend, again, to all readers simply because her imagination is so real and full of heartbreaking emotion that it is impossible to not think for at least a moment that everything happening in this book is real. This book is beautiful and full of terror, just like any book of perfection, yes perfection, is.
More like 4.5 stars We stayed and looked and waited for him to come back, as if our love was a beacon that he could use to light his way home, to crawl up the sides of the earth and back through his front door This book was so adorable. This is the first audiobook Ive ever listened to, and it was an amazing experience. Can I just say that Phoebe Strole the person who narrated the audiobook has a lovely voice and brought these characters to life. This is a wonderful audiobook and I highly recommend it. This is the story of Emmy  Oliver. Oliver got kidnapped by his Father when he was 7 years old, and Emmy was his best friend and next door neighbor. Now the story takes place 10 years later when they finally find Oliver and he returns to the small town where he grew up. This is a lovely and powerful story about growing up, family, friendships, and a whole lot more. I was surprised by how invested in this I became. These characters all felt so real and I loved all of them. Emmy has insanely strict parents and shes obsessed with surfing. Emmys best friend Caro short for Caroline is so sassy and amazing and relatable. I loved her so much, shes a perfect example of a perfect side character. Drew is Emmys other best friend who is gay and his family is having trouble accepting him. I loved the addition of an LGBT character in this book. It made it all the better. Oliver is probably my favorite character and the most interesting in my opinion. Hes been through something so traumatizing, his own Father kidnapped him and now he has to find his place back in his old town. Hes become a local celebrity with the kidnapping being on the news, and its so interesting to see what its like for him to adjust to this new life. Its difficult to see him struggle with happiness but it makes sense. He didnt know his Father had kidnapped him and now hes getting thrown back into a life he barely remembers. Its so fascinating. I feel like this book could have really benefited from having alternating perspectives between Emmy and Oliver. Emmy is a wonderful narrator, dont get me wrong, but I wouldve loved to see some chapters from Olivers perspective. Hes such an interesting character, I wouldve loved to read from his perspective. The only way I could describe what kissing him felt like was, like the last day of school, knowing that months of freedom and sunshine lay before you, the feeling that you could do anything you wanted and time stretched out in endless possibilities. Emmy and Olivers romance was really cute and I enjoyed it a lot but that definitely isnt what this book is about. Theres only a little romance, this is mainly a coming of age story for Emmy and mostly Oliver. I loved all the scenes with Emmys parents as well because their family was so relatable with my family but my parents arent nearly as strict thankfully. I couldnt actually believe how strict her parents were at some points in this. They are mad at her for staying up til 2am at a sleepover.. Like? Its a sleepover. Also, the fact that she has to hide surfing from them because they are afraid shed break her neck is ridiculous. And when they grounded her for applying to college without telling them, lmao. Well, thats growing up, isnt it? my dad said. You dont always have to know. And things arent always fair. You just have to keep moving forward. A step in one direction. Im not going to lie, the ending made me cry a little bit, but thats probably only because Im also currently at the same point in my life where I dont rely on my parents as much anymore and Im more independent which is exciting and scary at the same time. Its hard to let your parents go and grow up and do things on your own and its even harder for your parents to let you go. That was emphasized a lot in this book, and it was so heart warming and beautiful. I love good stories involving a family. Its a reminder of whats important in life. That scene where Oliver is finally face to face with his Dad again in the cafe was so sad and beautiful. Then when his dad said he was turning himself in and Oliver was grabbing at him and hugging him I was crying. It was so sad and beautiful. Im glad his Dad did the right thing. From that scene until the end I was pretty much crying. The more you start to love someone, the more you ache when theyre gone, and maybe its that middle ground that hurts the most, when you can see them and still not feel like youre near enough. The writing style was very simplistic and sweet, it reminded me of Morgan Matsons writing style. The characters and writing style had very similar vibes to Morgan Matsons books, which was awesome. I just loved and adored this book so much. It was so so so good and cute and adorable and I miss it already. I looked forward to listening to this audiobook on the way to work everyday and now Im not sure what Ill listen to haha. These characters will stay with me for quite some time. Really cute book, I highly recommend it.
Initial Impressions 112815: Final rating probably 4.5 stars Whewwww its over! I dont know whether to be happy or sad. Its so hard to part with a series Ive come to love so much! Okay, so spoilerfree thoughts... I did love every piece of this but there were parts that I didnt fee AS engaged so thats where from a rating stand point its not a full five stars. I do understand that we had a lot to go through and a lot to set up to get here though! I missed those bits of the relationships that truly bring me in and make me swoon  there are some GREAT parts but Im greedy and I always want more! Ahh I just cant believe its over. The ending was just perfect and I feel very satisfied! Im so glad to hear that STARS ABOVE has an epilogue because gahhh I need even more still! Full review as originally posted HERE on The Book Addicts Guide 121415: How does one read the last book in one of their favorite series much less REVIEW it? Actually, as highly anticipated as WINTER was, I really do have some coherent thoughts. Theyre much more coherent than I was with CRESS, I think, because Ive been preparing for this! Lets start off with the amazing, shall we? I absolutely love that this series adds layer upon layer with the story and the characters. We finally get to meet and spend time with Winter in this book and it was so awesome to have that final piece of the puzzle fall into place. This book had some serious squadgoals when this team comes together and I adore how they just fit together as a crew so well. Their personalities just mesh, their stories collide, and its absolute perfection. I also love how much these characters evolve over the course of the series. Its really about getting to know each one of them as theyre simultaneously going through the most complicated things of their lives. I really got to see their true character and how much each one of them grew throughout these experiences. ALL THE SHIPSSSS. Cress and Thorne are my absolute favorites and they have some really, really great moments in this book. Ive been rooting for them since CRESS and their relationship is just too adorable. Things really start to amp up with another one of my new favorites ships  Cinder and Kai. Yes, yes, I know. You guys have been on board since CINDER but I didnt quite get into their relationship as much until CRESS and then I fell in love all over again with my rereads. I just love their banter and how much strength each of them has not only individually but together. They had some super sweet moments and some really serious ones as well that really pushed my love for them over the edge! I actually do wish there had been a few more swoony moments? Oh boy were there some big ones... But Im such a sucker for these relationships that I just want more! The second half of the book really started to bring everything together and this is where the action was at! I actually wished a few more holy cow moments had happened in the beginningmiddle because as exciting as all that action was, I didnt quite feel stunned until later on in the book. Naturally, though, the halfwaypoint is where its at! The pacing really picked up and the book took off running and I was so excited and scared and happy all at the same time! I rather enjoyed the take on Snow White and it was really fun to see some very obvious comparisons especially after hearing Marissa tell us the tale at her WINTER signing! and then realize much later on that something was totally fairytale related and I hadnt even realized it the whole time the mining sector, right! I just loved the ending and how much nonstop action there was. These characters came into their own and really proved how brave they were to stop crazy old Levana from tearing the world apart. So as we know, Im a huge fan of The Lunar Chronicles. To start reading the final book was a mix of emotions with excitement and sadness dominating them all. I think because I was really not ready to say goodbye, I MAYBE ended up distancing myself from the book so I wouldnt be too heartbroken when it ended and that could be the reason why I didnt feel AS connected as I had with the other books. Theres also the fact that theres just so much going on throughout this finale it IS over 800 pages, after all that it is a lot to take in. Thats not a bad thing but there is a whole lot of action, many characters, high stakes, and final countdowns so it really is putting that final sense of urgency on everything. I also have to say that Winter was my least favorite leading lady. It was just really hard to connect with her because of her visions and illness. Its just a thing for me where I have a hard time connecting to characters who are more childlike or fanciful. Cress was definitely on the naive side but she wasnt childish, and I felt like it was hard for me to connect with her the way I had with the other girls. Obviously shes incredibly strong for being able to keep from using her Lunar gift all these years and thats the reason why shes been going mad but that aspect still was a bit hindering for me to really love her as much as the other girls. WINTER was absolutely wonderful and while I dont think it was my favorite of the series honestly, I dont think seriesenders are EVER my favorites of the series  too much pressure!, I still absolutely loved it. I will forever be in love with the world that Marissa Meyer created and I cant thank her enough for this beautiful series. Its brought me so much happiness, allowed me to work with so many awesome people, and has even presented me with amazing opportunities to become more involved in the book community. Im so joyful that I read it thanks, Alyssa! and Im sure Ill keep rereading it for many years to come!
Reread on audio This is one of the best books I have ever read. Im going to say a lot of personal things on here then go on with the review which will include spoilers, but I will put up the spoiler alert before I do. I also want to add some quotes from the book and the authors note at the end. This book is about teen suicide and bullying. But, its also about some wonderful people, happy moments and a bit of crazywonderful. When I was young I was bullied in school most of my life. I ended up quitting school and getting a high school diploma through the mail, which is legit but doesnt seem so since I never finished school. I never told my family about this and to this day at 43 they still do not know. My entire family think I was just some kind of a loser that didnt want to go to school. Never judge a book by its cover right? When I got sick, physically in 2008 it put me in the hospital overnight and I came out with all kinds of mental disorders. Im guessing they were brewing on the surface as I have always had some anxiety. I came out with severe panic disorder, agoraphobia fear of going outside for me, ocd, depression and then came the physical stuff being fibromyalgia and arthritis from all the hard playing I used to do outside before all of this and hereditary with the arthritis, Im assuming. All of these things turned so bad that I wanted to kill myself many times. I still feel suicidal to this day, and yes I see an psych, no I dont take a million pills, only one for panic. The one thing that held me back was my dog Dakota, I never wanted to leave him, he was my son. Then he had to be euthanized suddenly in Feb. of 2013 from cancer. He just collapsed and then here I am having to kill him. And I thought this is it, I can finally leave and go with him. One out of the couple of friends I have, sent me flowers because she knew he was my son and how much it about killed me much less me killing myself. Surprising to me was that my dad was very understanding and always checking on me since I cried every day. My family knew I always said I wanted to leave this world when he goes, so I guess he was a little worried. And my stupid self let my family and doctor talk me into getting another dog. Now here I am with my rescued greyhound and I dont want to leave her, but I tell you I feel the pull of suicide a lot. I even tell her about it. Her name is Lucy. The reason Im telling all of these personal things is I want some people to know a few things from someone that really thinks about these things. It doesnt make any of us freaks and we cant just get over it. Thats what people say in this world with mental illness. If its not physical its not real, well I would like them to walk a day in any persons shoes with any kind of mental illness. If we could just get over it we would have freakin done that by now. Im going to add a quote from the book that sums up how I feel personally and I know alot of people feel the same way. QUOTE FROM BOOK Amanda stares at her hands. I can only tell you how I felt. Ugly. Disgusting. Stupid. Small. Worthless. Forgotten. It just feels like theres no choice. Like its the most logical thing to do because what else is there? You think, No one will even miss me. They wont know Im gone. The world will go on, and it wont matter that Im not here. Maybe its better if I was never here. Quote finished This gave me chills because I have said that in my head and out loud so many times. I even asked my parent why they even had me. And you see so many people seem like they are ok, they can hide these things. Look at Robin Williams, it doesnt matter if your rich or poor, if something is going on with you and there is nothing to be done or no one sees it... thats it. Being lonely sucks! Okay, lets move on to the review! SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT I fell in love with Finch from the very beginning. I liked Violet too, but its Finch that steals the story. He is fun, crazy, seems like he is so full of life, but hes not.. Finch and Violet meet at the top of the bell tower at school. This was not a planned meeting, this was a random meeting of two people that where thinking of committing suicide. Can you imagine, someone messes up your suicide attempt. These stupid, insignificant prats are yelling for Finch to jump. They should have the crap beat out of them. People like that make me sick. Anyway, Finch ends up talking Violet down from the tower but lets everyone think its the other way around and she is labeled as a hero. They end up being friends, but not without a lot of pushing on Finchs part. Violet doesnt really want to be around anyone too much. Her sister Eleanor was in a car wreck with her almost a year ago and Eleanor died and she didnt. Violet feels like this is her fault because she told her to take the iceslicked bridge. So Violet has her own issues. She wont get in a car, things like that. Sweet, wonderful Finch brings out all of the good in Violet. Brings her back to herself. They do a cool report for school together where they wander around and look at wonders in their town. Its so wonderful and I would love to do that! They do fall in love, and I was so hoping this would help Finch. But throughout the book he is still fighting these death feelings. He has a mom and two sisters, but they dont see anything wrong, they just say that is Finch. He has a dad who left them for another woman and her son and he is a big jerk of a dad always saying Finch is a loser etc. I think Theodore Finch is a wonderful character. Just like so many out there that take there lives or lose their lives. I can see how wonderful he is, but he just cant. Obviously, Finch takes his life, but Im not going to say how he does it. Im not going to say any more about this wonderful book but to tell everyone to read it! Read it! Understand it! Love it! These things are real! People like this are real! And there should be no room left in the world for bullies or people that dont understand mental illness. Get off your high horse and let others live the way they want and try to have some compassion! I cant find the other quote I highlighted but I think I got my point across! Im going to put the Authors Note in here because I think it is another important thing for people to read. Im not going to add her personal parts of the note because that may not be right to do unless she asks me too. Im just going to add the basic parts and some hotlines. AUTHORS NOTE FROM THE BOOK Every forty seconds, someone in this world dies by suicide. Every forty seconds, someone is left behind to cope with the loss. In All The Bright Places, Finch worries a lot about labels. There is, unfortunately, a good deal of stigma surrounding suicide and mental illness. Often, mental and emotional illnesses go undiagnosed because the person suffering symptoms is too ashamed to speak up, or because their loved ones either fail to or choose not to recognize the signs. According to Mental Health America, an estimated 2.5 million Americans are known to have bipolar disorder, but the actual number is a good two to three times higher than that. As many as 80 percent of people with this illness go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. If you think something is wrong, speak up. You are not alone. It is not your fault. Help is out there. End of partial AUTHORS NOTE Some hotlines: SUICIDE PREVENTION 1800273TALK  suicidepreventionlifeline.org DIAGNOSING MENTAL ILLNESS IN TEENS  helpguide.org I recommend this book to everyone! www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com
I wish you to become who you were born to be. To become queen. This is the third book in the Throne of Glass series written by Sarah J. Maas. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as much as I did the first 2 including the novellas. I honestly feel like this book is one of my favorites this year! The series just keeps getting better, every book adds more twists and turns and I just cant imagine what will happen in the next one. This book is fairly larger than the other ones and has a lot more content to offer the reader. The beginning was a bit slow, but all of the content was necessary to the plot. One of the things I felt that I liked so much about this book was how it was set apart from the others in the series. The characters are beginning to make alliances, The plot is most definitely thickening, the feel was more ominous, and everything is just so...explosive. Because I am lost, she whispered onto the earth. And I do not know the way. In this book we see a completely different side of Celaena. Were so used to the arrogant, fearless, cocky assassin. In this book we jump to the other end of the spectrum where we witness the darkness and the selfloathing that she keeps buried. Celaena is still mourning the death of Princess Nehemia, but with her death came the memories of all those that she couldnt save in time. She breaks down all the barriers and lets the pain and suffering bind itself to her. Lets it take over and control her. Celaena had so much growing to do in this book. With Crown of Midnights huge plot twist she is left with the battle of whom she should be. The Queen, that everyone wants and needs. Or the fearless and bloodlusting assassin. I believe that this book was definitely Celaenas turning point. In this book, we are able to witness the painful memories of how Aelin became Celaena, how her life changed forever on that terrifying night ten years ago. Hed known, since the moment he figured out who she was, that while Celaena would always pick him, Aelin would not. I found myself feeling very irritated toward Chaol for majority of this book. Toward the end I began to see what his true intentions were. In this book, Chaol and Dorians relationship is on a standstill. Neither of them seem to want to fix the relationship that was left in pieces on the ground after Crown of Midnight, so we see them becoming estranged which broke my heart. We also see Chaol struggling to decide who side he should be on. Whether it will be the Queen who is rising to take her throne back or his childhood friend who has stuck by him all these years. Dorian....I am so proud of Dorian. Throughout this book we see Dorian in the process of finally getting over Celaena. With a girl whom he meets in the infirmary. We see him purposely beating himself up just to get a reason to talk to her. I felt so happy for him! even if it was shortlived. We also see Dorian struggling to conceal his powers. The thing that made me so proud of Dorian even if it was his downfall was the way he is able to stand up to his father and we finally see the side of Dorian that is made to be a King. He begins to shift out of his comfort zone and act out to defy his father. I am happy to report that we also meet some new badass characters in this book! I claim you, Rowan Whitethorn. I dont care what you say and how much you protest. I claim you as my friend. Ah yes, Rowan Whitethorn. I ABSOLUTLEY ADORED HIM! We meet this newcomer when Celaena is in Wendlyn, wasting away. He swooped in and took her to meet Maeve, who Celaena journeyed to find. We find out Celaena must be deemed worthy before she is able to retrieve the answers she seeks. With the help of Prince Rowan she is offered a chance to hone her powers and abilities. While undertaking this task Celaena makes an unlikely ally in him. Okay, Rowan was absolutely positively awesome in this book. Not only did he help Celaena break the surface with her powers, but they became a very very good duo! They were cunning, swift, and....had a deep connection. He is arrogant and patient, protective and caring, but most of all lethal. He also doesnt put up with Celaenas arrogance. She says something sassy, he leaves he with a black eye and a limp, simple. His character is just....perfection. Does the name Ashryver ring any bells? We meet a new General who goes by the name of Aedion Ashryver. He bears the kings black obsidian ring, but dont let that fool you. His character is very smart and intelligent in the way he thinks. He is also loyal, so very loyal , to his Queen, childhood friend and Cousin, Aelin. He makes alliances with some of the character and some of his plans of actions are brash, but so so loyal! That is actually the word that best describes him, I think, loyal. You didnt need a weapon at all when you were born one. We also have the pleasure of meeting Manon, heir of the Blackbeak coven of the infamous Ironteeth witches and leader of the Thirteen. These witches play a huge role in the Kings newest plans in warfare by becoming riders to the Wyverns which he has made. Manons goal throughout this book is to become Wing Leader and lead, not only her coven, but all the Ironteeth Witches into battle. Although she is bloodthirsty, I liked her character. I didnt enjoy her story as much as the other new character, but her story was intriguing. She isnt a villain, which I also found fascinating. She turned out to be a different kind of heroine, one who was still very dark and heartless. Now! I actually came to loathe the King of Adarlan with such a passion in this book it was unbelievable. The things he did in this book I found repulsive and completely disgusting! Dont even get me started on what he did to Dorian, it actually made me cry! Sarah J. Maas has completely obliterated my standards for books. She set the bar so high, I dont know how any other author is capable of reaching it! I am compeltely in love with this series and if you know anything about me you know that I am more than a little in love with Celaena. This book just made my love for her know nobounds! She is now my Queen and I would bow before her feet no pun intended. All her new characters added a new dynamic to this book that made it so much more of a hit for me! I absolutely loved, everything about this book! It was exactly what I was waiting for! I lost count of how long I cried and for how many chapters, but thats beside the point, thank you so much Sarah J. Maas! Sorry, not sorry for all the puns in this review. Read the book then reread it. Youll see. 
3.5 Stars Okay, I have a lovehate relationship with this book. I just finished reading this a few minutes ago and Im still trying to process everything that just happened. Did I love this book as much as I expected to? No. Did I love this book as much as Unteachable? Not even close. But yet I still enjoyed this book. Leah Raeder instantly became a favorite of mine last year when I read Unteachable. I knew from that point on I would read anything she writes because her writing is absolutely fucking gorgeous. And this is still very true. I highlighted something on nearly every page of this book. The way she words things and uses metaphors so beautifully, its flawless. Her writing is unlike anything Ive ever read before. That is the main reason why I will always read her new books, because she is a crazy talented writer. This book was so incredibly different from Unteachable, which I appreciate in a way. I appreciate that Leah Raeder is a really diverse writer and her books wont follow the same formula. With that being said, there were a few aspects of this book that just didnt sit well with me and irritated me a lot. I never wanted to be saved. I wanted someone to follow me down into the darkness. Lets get all the negative out of the way first: 1 The chapter timelines. I was so fucking confused while I was reading this. I didnt read this all in one sitting, so I thought it was really hard to remember the timeline and what happened at what time and what the characters knew and didnt know. It was crazy. The chapters are literally like this: April, last year... March, this year.... October, last year..... July, last year... January, this year.. Like, there was no order to it. It wasnt a flashback, then the present, type of thing. It was just all over the place and it really, really bothered me. I just wish there was more consistency with the timeline, thats all. 2Laney. I know that she isnt supposed to be an extremely likeable character or anything, I mean she even states in the first chapter that she is not the average heroine and that she isnt going to magically change by the end of the story, but some of her decisions were frustrating. I didnt see eye to eye with her most times and I found some of her actions to be immature and at times confusing. She was hypocritical and overdramatic and I dont know, not my favorite character. 3The over use of sex and drugs. I have read plenty of erotica novels before, and books that involve drugs and intoxication, but this book just constantly had sex scene after sex scene after sex scene, and in between all of that doing drugs and drugs and more drugs. It just got kind of repetitive after a while. And honestly, some of the sex scenes werent really necessary to the story. I understand the purpose of having them and I dont mind reading them, but I just wanted the story to move along faster. And I hated how the characters were always on some kind of drug, or drinking some kind of alcohol. Like seriously? I dont think there was a moment in this book when Laney wasnt high off of something. 4The purpose for Laneys revenge I was honestly surprised when I discovered Laneys reason to want to get revenge on all these people. I think shes being way too over the top. I mean everyone has experienced bullying at some point in there life. Its not the end of the world. I can imagine it;s difficult for someone who is gay and is being bullied specifically for that reason, and I completely understand where she is coming from, but honestly, violence is not the answer. And she takes it to extremes. Its just a little ridiculous to me. The whole summer was inside of us. As far as the good goes, I just really love Leah Raeders writing. I could read it all day, its so engaging and atmospheric. The first chapter of this book was really fucking intense and it pulled me in right away. I honestly loved Blythe and Armin. The way she describes them is done so well and I felt as if I knew them in real life. Blythe, the fierce blonde Australian who has soft skin and crystal blue eyes, and Armin, the philosophical DJ who has skin the color of sand. Just the way she describes these characters makes them so easy to imagine. I loved all the scenes between Blythe and Laney, and with Armin and Laney. I was quickly caught up in this love triangle and I didnt know who I wanted her to be with more. But really though, I adored Laney and Blythe together and I was rooting for them the entire book. I love how their romance felt so forbidden and secret, it was really cute. I loved Laneys brother Donnie, and to be honest, he is probably the only sane person in this story. Hes just so young and innocent and depends on Laney so much, its really sweet. I genuinely felt bad for him throughout 90 of this novel. Surprisingly, I actually really like Caitlin, Laneys mother as a character. Even though she was bipolar and psychotic, I think she spoke a lot of truth and I actually agreed with half of the shit she said. She said things like: Anyone whos happy in a world this fuckedup has some serious psychological issues. You think Im crazy because I see things as they are. Youd rather put on Disneyland goggles and watch TV and pretend its fine. Its not crazy if I see monsters when I live in a fucking nightmare. I dont know if its because Ive experienced depression before, but her Mom had a lot of great quotes like this that I could relate to. I dont know if that says something about me, but I found her Mom to be inspiring at times, no matter how crazy everyone thought she was. I also felt really bad for Laneys Dad because you can obviously tell hes a good person and I cant imagine its easy having to deal with someone like Caitlin as a wife. I really hated Zoeller and Kelsey and all those assholes from her high school. Such unbelievable pricks. Overall, I have mixed feelings about this book. I wanted to love it like I loved Unteachable, but I just didnt. I didnt connect with Laney in the same way I connected with Maise. But I still really did enjoy this book. It has a lot to offer. This book will definitely be on my mind for the next couple of days. Either way, I will still read anything Leah Raeder writes because her writing is gorgeous and I love it and this book is no exception when it comes to that.
4 Stars, Completed August 18, 2015 Okay. Im not sure why it took me two months to gather my thoughts to write this book review, but it did. With a lot of time to contemplate on how I should appropriately start this, I can now easily say that this book is For the ones that dream of stranger worlds. A Darker Shade of Magic opens up a world where readers learn of four Londons, where Kell, an Antari and one of the last Travelers, is a rare magician that is able to travel across these parallel universes. Hes also the adopted Prince of Red London and an ambassador that helps the rulers of each London keep in contact. Many admire but also fear Kell for the rarity and power of his race. What his royal family does not know is that hes also a smuggler off the clock. But then his dangerous hobby leads him to an accidental treason and he flees to Grey London, where he meets Delilah Lila Bard, a stealthy and sharptongued thief and wannabe pirate that is addicted to risk and adventure. At first she steals from him but ends up later saving his life, and they decide to embark on a dangerous journey to save the Londons but first they must stay alive. So Kellinspired by the lost city known to all as Black Londonhad given each remaining capital a color. Grey for the magicless city. Red, for the healthy empire. White, for the starving world. Im going to express the same thing every other reader has said about this book: the idea of the parallel Londons is uber cool and original. I really loved that each London had its own distinct qualities, some of them a lot more dingier and grotesque than others. Schwab certainly did not disappoint me in the world building department. Everything was illustrated in an appropriately evocative manner and not at all tedious. However, the beginning section did give me some time to warm up to. I think I spent a week trying to get through the first couple of chapters, but I also was experiencing a pretty bad reading slump and I think my mood for the fantasy genre was waning as I was reading this hence why after this book I read a string of ya contemporaries. As for the characters, before picking this up I heard from a lot of readers that the lack of connection toward the characters was the main reason why this wasnt a five star read for them. And Im partially in agreement with this. Theres Dull London, Kell London, Creepy London, and Dead London, she recited, ticking them off on her fingers. See? Im a fast learner. Usually, Im drawn towards the cheeky, sarcastic characters but I was slow to warm towards Lila. I think this was because her background remained unclear and mysterious throughout the story. Arent you afraid of dying? he asked Lila now. She looked at him as if it were a strange question. And then she shook her head. Death comes for everyone, she said simply. Im not afraid of dying. But I am afraid of dying here. She swept her hand over the room, the tavern, the city. Id rather die on an adventure than live standing still. But one thing that I really, really enjoyed about her personality was the sense of adventure, which is perfect since shes an aspiring pirate and all haha, that just sounds silly, I know. Im just really hoping that Schwab decides to focus on her a little more in the next installment. As for Kell, for lack of better words, he was just okay. I enjoyed his narrative a little more than Lilas but that was pretty much it. There were moments I felt for him, but most times I couldnt really understand him. And his relationship with Prince Rhy... I wasnt too invested in it, so at the end when I was supposed to be emotional, I wasnt. On the other hand, Holland, the only other Antari, was the character that I was greatly intrigued by. This is no surprise though. You guys know how the lonely characters just pull at my heartstrings... but he was eventually killed off. Now that scene made a wave of intense sadness wash over me. But going back to my earlier statement of being partially in agreement with the lack of connection towards the characters... I think what readers fail to realize is that this is only the first installment. For characters like Lila I think it takes some time and more development before the reader can fully understand her. So the characters, though they were underdeveloped and still in a somewhat cardboard stage, have plenty of room to grow in the next books. Where did you get this? he asked. In a pocket in your coat, said Lila, stretching. By the way, did you know that your coat is more than one coat? Im pretty sure I went though five or six to find that. Kell stared at her, slackjawed. What? she asked. How did you know what it was for? Lila shrugged. I didnt. What if it had been poison? he snapped. Theres really no winning with you. Despite my iffiness towards the characters, I have to admit Kell and Lilas easy banter was superb. The pair had a pretty rocky start but by the end since they went to hell or scary White London and back, I began to really like the idea of them being together. Something about the comaderie between couples is what gets me. He would see her again. He knew he would. Magic bent the world. Pulled it into shape. There were fixed points. Most of the time they were places. But sometimes, rarely, they were people. For someone who never stood still, Lila felt like a pin in Kells world. One he was sure to snag on. But there really wasnt that much romance in this. But I think this slow burn attractionnot really romancetype of development was perfect. Im anticipating more dynamics with the romance arc of this as the series progresses. No full fledge sexy times type of stuff though. So, overall, I thought A Darker Shade of Magic did its job with setting a foundation and piquing everyones anticipation for the sequel. I was a little let down by the character development, but didnt find it a huge deal breaker since this is only book one. Schwab really makes up for it with the exquisite writing and the marvelous world building. Honestly, the only thing I was majorly down by was the plot. Now with two months of retrospection, I really can see that the plot was more on the meh to simple side. I was expecting a more intricately crafted complex plot, so I was sort of greatly dismayed by finding this more easy one. Anyway, although I wasnt that fond with a few things, overall, this is definitely a strong start to a series I know Ill grow to love. The writing is captivating; Victoria Schwab is definitely on my radar now. Im really anticipating A Gathering of Shadows, and I have a feeling Vicious thats my next Schwab read hopefully will be wicked!

The best lies come from the truth. I just found out this book was originally meant as a standalone. Im not sure what I would have done in that case. Died from grief, probably. The three weeks I have to wait until the release of A Torch Against the Night seem like real torture already. Im relieved Ive only read this book at this time. Now I might just have a chance at surviving the wait. It has been quite some time since Ive actually screamed out in agony at a book. Which I did in this case. Embarrassingly. But it was so wickedly cruel that I couldnt help myself. I felt terrible when characters that loved and cared for each other were suddenly played against one another in a most horrific way. So I screamed and barely kept myself from tearing my hair out. Much good it did me. It didnt help. Horror took place anyway. Fear is only your enemy if you allow it to be. Too much fear and youre paralyzed. Too little fear and youre arrogant. An Ember in the Ashes was not what I had expected it to be. It reminded me a lot of The Darkest Minds in the way that it was a lot darker and took things a lot further than most young adult fantasies. There was killing and brutality, there was severe torture... and then there was all of that from people Id actually started to love. But it was good. It was so, so good. The darker and messier a story gets, the more it sucks me in. Makes me care. It makes me root for characters in the most heart wrecking way. Because there is grief. There always is in stories like this, and while it actually hurts, it also breeds a grim determination to keep faith in your newfound heroes and stick with them to the end. I never feared the night, not even as a child, but Blackcliffs night is different, heavy with a silence that makes you look over your shoulder, a silence that feels like a living thing. Elias Veturius is one. A new personal hero. He is a prodigy amongst the graduates at the empires military academy Blackcliff and while most students and his friends admire him for it, it is a burden hed rather shed off if he could. Because despite being one of the finest soldiers, he hates everything hes doing. Everything hes good at. Hed give anything to leave it all behind and to be free from all the horrors his kind stands for. But he cant  and it almost ruins him. It makes him lonely and reckless. His heart is honest, genuine and pure. The struggle and storm raging inside of him went straight to my core and made my own heart ache accordingly. I believed in him, I understood him and I admired his courage and bravery. All I could do was hope for things to work out and instead everything kept growing worse. Remember me screaming? Yeah, it was all for him. Life is made of so many moments that mean nothing. Then one day, a single moment comes along to define every second that comes after. Such moments are tests of courage, of strength. I also endlessly admired his friend Helene Aquila. A mere side character some might say, but I wholeheartedly disagree. She was such a strong character. There was just as much conflict in her as in Elias, maybe even more. She is the only female student at Blackcliff and a sort of prodigy in her own way. Being the only girl deemed worthy to train at the academy is an incredible honor. It also isolates her from everyone else. But she is strong, she is confident and stands completely behind every ideal taught at the academy. Elias has been her best friend since childhood and although she doesnt completely realize the exact depth of his doubts, she knows that he thinks differently. Which creates the need for constant compromising. A part of her wants to protect him from everything hed go through if he were found out. The other part feels an obligation to the empire and knows he poses a threat. Which would all be bad enough in its own, but is worsened by the fact that she is also hopelessly in love with him. A love she knows is unrequited, a love she knows would never work because they are just too different. She hates it. Hates the jealousy she feels, hates the weakness it creates. There was so much true emotion in her, that even though sometimes it felt like she was the bad guy, Helene was the one I was rooting for. I so desperately want her to be happy. But the way things are now, I dont think happiness is in her cards. Ugh, it physically hurts just think about it. I loved her so much. Helenes no passing attraction. Shes family. More than that. Shes part of me. Shes still clinging to the side of her mountain, just like Im still wandering lost in my battlefield. And then theres Laia  who is actually the main character. A girl with a strong heart and a lions spirit. She was everything you would want a young heroine to be and still I missed a bit of a connection. I feel like we havent really seen everything shes capable of. That she needs to develop more. Despite her admirable actions, she felt pretty young and inexperienced at times. Naive too. Im really curious who she will become in the next book. I have great hopes for her, but in An Ember in the Ashes she was completely overshadowed by both Elias and Helene. Or maybe it was just that I could somehow relate better to the two of them. There are two kinds of guilt. The kind thats a burden and the kind that gives you purpose. Let your guilt be your fuel. Let it remind you of who you want to be. Draw a line in your mind. Never cross it again. The story itself is tense, fastpaced and creative. I liked the world building and the grim atmosphere of the military academy of Blackcliff. I liked the multilayered side characters and the grey zones they operated in. I liked the conflict in the book and in myself. The plot is creative and strong. People are played against one other and there is the constant threat of total doom hanging over their heads. There is romance, but it never takes the focus away from the main story. Everythings perfectly balanced. I had to restrain myself from rushing through the book, because I was so anxious to find out what was going to happen next. Sabaa Tahir wrote a most compelling story and I cannot wait to find out how it will evolve. Full five star book. If you havent read it.. what on earth are you waiting for? Go!
4th read August 2017 How do I love Six of Crows? Let me count the ways... If you dont know, and you should by now, since I mention this duology pretty frequently, this is a heist story. I love heists hit me up with your heist recommendations if you have any, so this plot was always going to be a winner for me. But, on my fourth read, what really stands out is just how exciting this story still is after all this time. Its a quick read, respite the enormous size of this paperback, and it also manages to have a lot of character depth. You have six protagonists, five of which have their own POVs and yet we also get these intricate backstories. Basically I could talk about the perfection of this book all day, every day, so dont get me started! For more bookish content check out www.cartonmanettedarnay.wordpress.com 1st Read January 2016 Um, so why in the world did it take me so long to get this book? Im hoping to get a proper review up sometime tomorrow, so see you then So, the majority of this review will be ever so spoilery, but fear not I will warn you when we reach that part. Ive only Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo, and I loved it so why I havent finished the series is a mystery, by typically me. I wouldnt say you needed to read that trilogy before you read Six of Crows because they are not connected, however would definitely say you should either read the whole trilogy or not to have read any of it. Because I had read Shadow and Bone, I knew enough about the characters and the world to pick up on a few things that I think gave away a pretty important plot point. It is a bit frustrating because, like I said, if I hadnt read Shadow and Bone, I would never have picked up on it since it was such a fleeting reference, but what can you do? I still intend to read the whole trilogy at some point in the future, but am definitely more exited for the sequel to Six of Crows. Leigh Bardugo is such a beautiful writer, which can be seen throughout this 500 page book. The narrative is so fast paced and so full of twists and turns that the books feels almost like a heist film. Like IaEURtmve already said, I am familiar with the world, and it was just and interesting and vivid as I remember. I am a city girl at heart so I did prefer to hear about the bustling city life of Ketterdam that what we saw in Shadow and Bone, but thataEURtms just me. Bardugo successfully created this beautifully gritty city that is still so vivid in my mind that I feel as though IaEURtmve been there, and as grim a place it is, I sort of want to go back under Dregs protection, of course. There were no parts that I thought could be cut out or were superfluous which meant that I was gripped by the whole 500 pages. In fact, I loved this book so much that I put off reading it, just so that it would last for longer, which is a fist for me. I have always been a lover of heist plots so it was always going to be a win, and this one was just something else. I just really cannot sing the praises of this book enough. So now is the time that I am delving into things that may be considered spoilers but they are not plot related. The reason for this is because the main reason I love this book so much is because of the ships, all of the ships. Now, if you dont consider the ships to be spoilers you may already be aware of them then by all means read on. So there were two ships that I was 100 invested in and the first was Kaz and Inej. Kaz is definitely my favourite character because he was so complex and so flawed. I can just tell that he will be one of my alltime favourite characters for years to come. One of the things that I loved about the characters in this book was that every one of them have their own backstory that make them who they are, including Kaz. He has certain issues that make him really quite vulnerable and yet despite this he was also so strong. I think this can be said for all of the characters involved in the heist, that they showed how you can be both strong and vulnerable and the same time, and that having a weakness does not make you weak. I think it was endearing to see how much he cares for Inej, and viceversa. But while it was super cute, there was a certain point where Kaz asked her to do something and she made a really good point. That point being that neither could aEURcureaEURtm each otheraEURtms weaknessaEURtm, something which you see in YA fiction frequently, but not here. The other ship that IaEURtmd been on board since his first chapter is Nina and Matthias. Who doesnaEURtmt love a relationship that blurs the line between love and hate so much. Both, but especially Matthias, have so much confusion and uncertainty over what they feel it makes their relationship seem so real. I adored how sassy Nina was, even since they first met and how serious Mathias was, which meant that they sort of bounced off each other. TheyaEURtmre a couple who just shouldnaEURtmt work but they do, and they do it so so well. Neither of them are perfect, and I was swearing at Matthias at a certain point, but they both want to atone for their sins and thataEURtms what I like about them. For a change I actually was able to relate to both Inej and Nina, and found myself loving the friendship between them. Also Matthias sounds very hot, and IaEURtmm not complaining. On the subject of hot guys, IaEURtmd definitely say that Kaz, in my mind at least, was also pretty fine. Dare I go as far as to say that the sequel to this book is my most anticipated book of the year? Yes, I think I do. I wouldnaEURtmt even be surprised if this is my book of the year, because itaEURtms definitely a very, very strong contender. Either way Six of Crows has right up to being one of my top five favourite books ever!
For full review, visit:  It has been several hours since I have finished reading It Ends With Us, and I am still unable to stop the train of emotions that hit me while reading this book. I am so behind my reviews right now, but I need to write this one right this instant. Not because I want to get everything out while it is still fresh because I am certain I will remember this story and all the feelings it brought out of me for a long time. But because it is not only the best book that Colleen Hoover has written to date, but it is one of the few books that affected me so deeply, that I think deserves to be read by every single person on this planet. The only other contemporary book that has affected me this much is In The Stillness by Andrea Randall. I am not sure if I want to outline all my emotions in full detail, or leave it vague because I went into this book completely unaware of what the story was about, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. So for those who have not read this book just yet, all I can say is just read it. It follows an incredibly mature, strong and wonderful character Lilly who narrates a tremendously deep storyline with many life lessons, love stories, terrible and wonderful actions, lifechanging experiences, friendships, family bonds, and overall, the perfect outline of what is like to be human. It gives muchneeded perspective on life and certain actions us humans often need to take. At least it changed my perception on quite a few sensitive topics. The strength of the book comes from Lillys character, and the wonderful writing technique Colleen Hoover uses in telling her story. A first persons point of view results in the reader sharing the same emotions with the main character. The storys continuation throughout several years, also giving insight into Lillys past through diary entries addressed to Ellen DeGeneres, provides tremendous depth of the story. But mostly, it surprises the reader making them fall in love with all the characters, excusing their wrongful behaviour on several occasions, and seeing the reasoning behind it. Not only it is an incredibly powerful story, it also is a great lesson. I believe every single person can find something relatable in this book. Colleen Hoover really outdid herself with this one. Although I have loved all of this womans work, when I think about some of her books now, I am not sure that the present me would like them as much as the past me. However, I guess with me maturing, I can see Colleen Hoover developing as a writer as well, and giving me exactly what I need with her every piece. So if you have not read this book just yet, I could not recommend it enough as it is truly lifechanging. But be warned of an emotional rollercoaster that is guaranteed to fall upon you. I have read this book during a long coach journey, and I hope not that many people saw me crying for a good couple of hours. So find a comfortable spot, preferably not in public, and read it. Discussion Now for those who have read this book or are not too bothered with some spoilers, I will continue with my ramblings since I do need to get all the emotions that I am feeling out right now. Abuse and the romanticizing it has been a topic that really gets me worked up for quite a while now. I believe far too many books make the abusive alpha males into people who are supposed to be admired and desired. Whereas some texts show only the really horrible parts of the abuse. Coleen Hoover struck the middle of it, exploring the idea of the abuse when it is not just black and white. She completely changed my perception on abuse, towards the abuser, and especially towards the victim. I am one of those people who see the victims of domestic abuse as stupid if they do not have the strength to leave this kind of life instantly after such incident occurs. Experiencing abuse myself on quite a few occasions, it was always hard for me to understand how this kind of behaviour can be excused. I have felt the physical abuse from my mothers boyfriend, and abuse by words from my stepgrandfather, and I could never understand how my mother and grandmother could be so weak and not leave those men. Especially since this abuse was directed towards me. I do not know if it affected my development as a person, but I always want to think that I dealt with it in the best possible way. I never took it, I never stayed silent, I was never afraid, and I always felt in the position of power. I did sometimes feel disappointed in the examples the women in my family were setting though. Now I do understand that it is not that easy. I guess my thick skin and the ability to see reason comes from the lack of emotion towards my abusers. But this book has opened my eyes to the reasons why some women find excuses. Some abusers are not just bad, and with love involved, the good part can easily overshadow the bad. I have seen this example in my stepgrandfather. He is an alcoholic, therefore has two personalities: when he is sober, he is good and caring, and when he is drunk  he is the meanest person on Earth. I always hear my grandmother telling everyone how good he is, but I was never able to excuse his bad parts just because he has good ones. I still do not excuse this behaviour, and never will, but I can see why she chooses to see the good instead of the bad. Regarding this book, it was haunting how relatable I found Lillys relationship with her father and her mother. But what confused me profoundly was the way I felt about Ryles character. I believe that abuse is never excusable, and yet I found myself trying to find reasons behind his behaviour and hoping for a happy ending for him. I loved that character, and although it is impossible to compare real feelings, I do get it now why many women forgive their abusers. I liked the outcome of the book very much, and believe that Colleen Hoover has written the most touching, realistic, and informative story about domestic abuse, and how it is almost never as white and black as you usually wish it was. My perception has changed so profoundly after I finished reading It Ends With Us, my heart was shattered into a million pieces, and yet I think this book should be read by every single woman on Earth because it shows the true colours of life. All humans make mistakes. What determines a persons character arent the mistakes we make. Its how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses. It really was a hunting story, it affected me on such a deep emotional level, and confused me in the way that allowed me to grow up some more. More books lie this should exist. Sorry for my ramblings, but sometimes getting everything out is a necessary step you have to take. I am certain I will remember this book for a long time, therefore my thoughts will always by here to be read whenever I need it.
The final fight for the Republic has begun. Everyone thought that after Anden became the new PrimoElector, peace had begun. Relationships with the Colonies were on the mend a new peace treaty being written and life for the people of the Republic had started to change for the better. Then everything changed when the Colonies attacked. Bent on destroying the Republic because of a virus spreading through their country, the Colonies are bringing all that they have against the Republic. War is looming. People are dying. Things arent ever going to be the same again. This is it. The last book. Whatever happens to June, Day, Anden, and all of our other favorite characters, is permanent. I repeat, this is the end. Whether Im ready for it or not, its over. Ive finished this series, and Im very sad about it. Throughout these books, Ive grown to love the characters as if they are my real friends. I care about what happens to them, and Ive spent the majority of this book on the edge of my seat with anticipation and dread. This is war, the final battle. Some characters are going to die, obviously, and although I knew it was coming I just didnt want it to be true. All characters in this book have strengthened it in their own ways, whether it be from their personalities, their actions, or their role. The characters with even small roles seemed just as important as June and Day. This leads me to congratulate Marie Lu on an amazing series. Youve done it! Youve managed to make a well rounded series with interesting characters, an intriguing and well thought out plot, and a believable and sweet romance. Not only that, but the war and political aspect of this book was superb. Very believable. I really dont know where to start with this because my emotions are still all over the place. I do know that I need to talk about the writing style of Marie Lu because it deserves mentioning. While its not out there, strange, and unique like Tahereh Mafi, it was just as magical. Marie Lu has the gift of being able to intricately describe something without taking an entire paragraph. Just a few sentences and whats being mentioned is clearly thought out in my head. I can see everything in my head as if she were showing me a picture. Her writing is lovely. Shes very talented. I feel like I should talk about the war part of this book because it does take up most of the book. The war itself is believable. Weve already got a fairly unstable relationship between the Republic and the Colonies, only held together by a peace treaty that hasnt even been finished yet, and any wrong move could ignite war again. These two countries, although once part of the United States, are now totally two different nations. Each country has their own way of doing things and they dont want to be messed with. So when things go to hell, war ensues. This war is going to take everything that the Republic has and then some. Their soldiers, their weapons, their land is all on the line. If the Colonies win this war, there will no longer be a Republic. The action and fighting really depicts the panic and fear of the Republic. Every soldier and civilian is wondering if tomorrow will be the day when the Colonies take over for good. With those thoughts, the people of the Republic are going to be fighting for their country, their lives, their families. The fighting that occurs in Champion is filled with determination and will because the people know that if they dont win this war everything will be turned upside down. The battle scenes are full of heartstopping thrills and will have you tensed up with dread. Youll be rooting for your favorite characters as they go onto the battlefield and never stop worrying for their safety. With that said, I should talk about the main characters June and Day. This book switches POVs often and, although I dont care much for POV switching, I did enjoy that aspect in this series and this particular book. Both characters are strong in their own ways, and I loved knowing what was going through their heads. June and Day are both equally important characters in the series and deserve to be heard. Despite everything that has happened to them, they hold on to their beliefs and never give up. Even when the impossible has happened and it looks like theres no chance whatsoever, they keep trying. June and Day have a knack for persevering through anything that comes their way. Theyll make it work no matter what. That just goes to show the big hearts that they have, not just for each other, but for everyone. For humanity. They might not have done everything the right way, but theyve always believed that their actions were helping someone else. Thats what I love about them. They arent selfish. As for their romance, this about sums up the awesomeness: I can feel his presence here in every stone he has touched, every person he has lifted up, every street and alley and city that he has changed in the few years of his life, because he is the Republic, he is our light, and I love you, I love you, until the day we meet again I will hold you in my heart and protect you there, grieving what we never had, cherishing what we did. I loved the romance between June and Day. It wasnt an easy romance at all. So many things threatened to tear them apart. The odds were against them. Hell, Day has a disease thats giving him only one month to live, and June is the one that helped kill his family, even if it wasnt intentional. Theres a lot of pent up emotions between the two, a lot of turmoil. Yet, despite all of that, they truly love each other. Can it be enough to let go of the past? Well, youll know when you read the book if you havent already! Seriously, if you havent read this yet, READ IT. The ending.. All I can say is that the ending is going to take your heart, smash it into a million pieces, and then stomp on it. Im not ashamed to say that I cried and cried and cried through the last twentyorso pages of Champion. If you cared for this series as much as I do, youre going to have a mixed feeling about the ending. The only way I can sum it up is this: bittersweet. sighs I dont know what to do with myself now that Ive finished this series. Its a bittersweet feeling. I know that its over and I need to accept it, but I dont want to. I am, however, truly grateful for this series as it was a great one, and to Marie Lu, who brought it to life. I recommend this entire series to everyone who hasnt read it yet. I absolutely loved it, and I hope that you will, too.
Rating: 4.5 Stars Nearly a decade ago, someone once told me that books are like memories; within their pages, they store your emotions and thoughts, a document of sorts of your experience. I still dont know how true that statement is, but I dearly hope it is  at least when it comes to Just One Day. Nothing better than this book itself can summon up the whirlwind of emotion I felt when I read it. Although I cracked open its spine with trepidation  there are, after all, a plethora of mixed reviews out there  my feelings quickly changed from that of anxiety to excitement as I was swept up alongside Allyson on her breathtaking journey. At one point, I wasnt sure if I was laughing or crying for I was so full of giddy happiness and bittersweet longing  those are the types of feelings a Gayle Forman novel inspires in you. I finished Just One Day with a smile on my face, my heart swelling with pride for Allyson, who felt as close to me as my own best friend, and although the pang I feel when I think of this novel is only an echo of what I feel for Formans If I Stay and Where She Went duo, I still love it, albeit in an entirely different way. Just One Day is a novel that will very easily either captivate or disappoint readers. Its a New Adult novel that almost demands that you be a teenager to truly understand it, for Allysons journey is such a personal and nostalgic experience, one that everyone can definitely relate to. One of the best ways I can find to summarize it is a realistic rendition of Kristen Hubbards Wanderlove. Although Wanderlove is one of my favorite books of all time, I cant deny that the chances of traveling to a new country and finding a hitchhiker to explore with are rather low. Thus, Allysons summer experience in Europe, a disappointing one full of touristy stops and not enough life is easier to relate to. When Willem, an enigmatic Dutch actor who Allyson sees performing Shakespeare in London, offers to take her around Paris  for just one day  she agrees, despite her goodytwoshoes attitude. What follows is a day of whirlwind journey; it isnt perfect, but its real and its far more rewarding than any other trip on Allysons summer vacation. Perhaps best of all, to Allyson at least, is that she is no longer Allyson, the girl who listens to her parents, studies hard, and never lives life the way so many other teens do; now, shes Lulu, a nickname Willem gives her, and as Lulu, Allyson is finally free to let loose the person she truly is inside. Nevertheless, her exhilarating journey is abruptly halted when, the next morning, Willem is gone. Now, Allyson is distraught, both at thinking that Willem may have just used her and at contemplating her life in college as a premed student  a path that her mother, not her, wants to follow. As Allyson will learn, however, her day in Paris wasnt about Willem at all  it was about her and finding out that she was more than she  or anyone else  ever quite imagined. Just One Day, as Im sure countless reviews have stated, is a journey of selfdiscovery. Although I will admit that it isnt wholly original, it is certainly memorable. Allyson has a certain vulnerability about her that makes her impossible not to love. In Paris, she may have been pretending to be Lulu, but that was who she really was and she struggles to find a way to be that person again, all while continuing to please her parents and hold onto her childhood best friend, Melanie, who constantly reinvents herself. One of my favorite aspects of this tale was the subtle heartbreak that came not only with seeing Allyson and Melanie grow apart, but also Allyson and her parents. In their place, however, Allyson makes new friends, never replacing those from her past, but simply realizing that growing up also means leaving room for new people to join her life, such as Dee, the African American boy she meets in her Shakespeare Out Loud class; the person who shows her that although she has many personas  Lulu, premed student Allyson, reliable Allyson  who she really is is a mixture of all the roles she plays, and still so much more. In my eyes, what makes Just One Day such a hitormiss novel is the mere fact that Allyson is a character trying to find her place in the world. After her trip to Paris, she comes to the stark realization that no one really sees her  not her parents, not her best friends, no one  except for Willem. Willem, who took a bargain in spending a day with her, unknowingly changed her entire life, not just because of who he was, but in what he brought out inside her. What I loved about this story was that Allyson found herself again  finds herself again  and this time, without Willem. It is this journey, this third journey almost; the first being her wakeup call, the second being her slow emergence from the typical life she leads that isnt really hers, to this now final journey of finding who she is all through her own experience, her own friends, her own interests, and her own initiatives. Its beautiful. Nevertheless, I will admit that Just One Day is not a perfect story. For one, some secondary characters, such as Allysons father, are astonishingly underdeveloped, lacking personality when surrounded by such wellfleshed out characters. Furthermore, this novel failed to impact me on an emotional level equal to that of If I Stay or Where She Went. I cant really pinpoint what it is that made this novel fall for me, but a certain aura or fully nuanced aspect of Allyson, perhaps, was missing. Unlike other readers, however, I was never bothered by the mysterious figure that Willem remained throughout the novel. If anything, I loved the way he was portrayed in this book  a traveler, a lonely young man, a player...or someone who weve all just judged too quickly, because, perhaps, theres more to him and his story than what we see before our eyes. Yet, what I liked best was that he didnt reappear in this story  once he left, he was gone and then it was all Allyson and the manner in which she came to terms with who he was and what he did for her, changing her life, was remarkable. Just One Day is a novel that just must be read. It is beautifully written and to see Forman take on something different  the idea of living truly and happily instead of the idea of choosing between life and death  was refreshing. Of course, there are many authors who have written selfdiscovery novels in the past, and I have liked some of them more than this one, but Formans tales just never leave my head. I was thinking about this the whole day, ever since I finished it last night at 11:54, which means I actually read Just One Day in exactly a day!, and I am still convinced that I have not extracted the full depth and meaning that this story has to offer. Its a universal tale, one that will transport you to other countries, make you feel emotions you thought you could never feel, and ultimately, just as it changed Allyson, it will change a small particle of you too.

Check out this review at Such a Novel Idea! I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. This is one of those books that Ive wanted to read since the moment I saw its cover, way before it was even a book on a shelf. And yet, here I still sat well, when I signed up for this tour at least, a person who had yet to read the awesomeness. So, YAY for a paperback release tour, because dang was that book something I needed in my life. First of all, I need to talk about the audiobook. I started the audiobook once upon a time, never reading the book and couldnt keep up with the story. SO, when I started reading for this review, I was reading the print version of the paperback that is being released. And man, it is GORGEOUS. The book itself is a freaking work of art and I cannot even imagine how many hours went into making it look that way. But, as I got into the story, I got desperate. You see, I would have to stop reading and come to this thing called work and the only books I am allowed to read during work hours are audiobooks. So, I gave it another try. And boy am I glad it did. The production value of this audiobook is one of the highest Ive ever seen. The voice actors were phenomenal and at times I felt more like I was listening to an old school radio program, because this was almost like a dramatized version of the book. Almost as in basically was just probably isnt labeled that way. There were freaking commercials and special sounds and music and voice actors ACTING out certain parts of the book My favorite part had to be a drunk message from Ezra to Kady. Classic. I honestly dont know which version I liked better, the print or the audio. So, Illuminae is straight up science fiction, but there is SO MUCH happening in the way the story is told. Youre getting it through files, instant messages, emails deleted, sent, drafts, etc., blacked out securitygovermentesque reports, pictures, etc. So, if you think a 600 page book is daunting, remember, its not gonna be near as many words as you think. Which, becomes bad when you want MORE of the story. Good thing book two is already out! And what could come off as kitchy if not done with the proper finesse, is just a freakin work of art. Seriously. I feel like Ill spend just as much talking about the way the book was made as I will the actual plot of the book. Because, its just that good. The only way this book could actually PULL OFF all this quirky formatting and not be a gimmick is if the characters and story itself were good. And they were damn good. The story revolves around two teens, Kady and Ezra, who break up the morning of an invasion on their planet. They both survive and are sent to different ships. But of course, they still are in love and its still way awkward. Kady becomes an underground hacker and Ezra gets conscripted. They are both hilarious with razorsharp wit and sarcasm to boot. And its hard not to like them both almost immediately. Kady was SMART and not just off the charts brilliant, but smart and rational for a teenager. She asked questions, thought through decisions, and didnt just leap off into a void unknowingly if she could help it. She is a character that quickly became a favorite for me. Ezra was funny and relatable and totally in love with Kady. And their romance was super fun, because it wasnt conventional. They werent together  quite literally on different ships  and yet, you could still see how much they meant to one another. I would be remiss if I didnt talk about the third main character, AIDAN. Yes, AIDAN is AI, specifically the AI that is supposed to be protecting the fleet. And while some would say it is just a computer, I say IT IS SO MUCH MORE. AIDAN brings its own life to the story in a hilarious and psychotic way and while I cant say more, I will say I kinda totally 100 dug it. This book will mess with your head. These authors arent afraid to make the big plot twists that leave you audibly gasping. Its definitely a wild ride youre about to go on when you start the book. It starts out slow, but when you finally look up, you realize theres no way you can put it down and stop until youve finished. I know this book isnt going to be for everyone. Like I said, its straight up scifi, but I think if people can put that aside, they will see it is totally worth testing the waters of this genre for. And the formatting is going to straight up piss some people off. For those people, I say listen to the audiobook. Youll hear a drama rather than seeing a bunch of crazy pages and it might make it better. But really, I cannot recommend this book enough. It stands on its own as a really rad, fun, wild read. Since the moment I picked up These Broken Stars when it was a galley, Ive been a fan of Amie Kaufman. I didnt know how well shed collaborate with another author outside that series, but obviously she has the gift, because her and Jay Kristoff are book writing magicians together.
Reviewed for THC Reviews Elizabeth Hoyt is such a masterful author, she never fails to amaze me with her stories. I absolutely love them and cant get enough of them. Duke of Sin ended up being yet another perfect read for me from this very talented writer, and thats not something I was completely convinced would happen when I picked up this latest book in her Maiden Lane series. Thats because of the hero, Val. I was thoroughly intrigued by him from the moment he stepped onto the canvas several books ago, and I felt like he definitely had hero potential. But in the intervening books, hes been a very, very bad boy whos stirred up quite a bit of trouble for other characters I loved, not the least of which was kidnapping Phoebe, one of my favorite heroines of the series. That gave me some pause as to whether he could be convincingly redeemed. I think my skepticism stemmed from a bad reading experience with another of my favorite authors in which one of her heroes was very similar to Val, but that hero ended up pushing a lot of unpleasant buttons for me so that I never believed in his supposed redemption. So while I was eager for Vals story, especially after we discovered in the last book what he did for his halfsister, Eve, I was also just a little trepidatious of possibly having another disappointing read. Im happy to report that I shouldnt have worried. As I said, Elizabeth Hoyt is a master, who totally made me fall for Val despite his villainous actions, making this book a real pleasure to read. Valentine is a character whos done a lot of terrible things in his life. Blackmailer, murderer, kidnapper, seducer... you name it, hes probably done it, and hes proud of it. Then he meets Bridget, and she begins to peel back his layers like an onion, revealing a sympathetic man underneath. Val believes himself to be a heartless cur who is incapable of love, but I knew based on his actions toward Eve that he did have a heart and could love. However, until Bridget, Eve is the only person upon whom he has bestowed that love. Otherwise, hes a masterful purveyor of information who enjoys making other people squirm and who doesnt seem to have much concept of right and wrong. He takes what he wants when he wants and pretty much does as he pleases with little thought of the consequences. When we learn how hellish his life was growing up, it all makes sense, though. He felt so powerless for a large part of his life, that I think he needed to possess power over others in order to keep them from possibly hurting him. Also his villainous father treated him abominably as a child so that Val never grew up knowing a genuine sense of right and wrong. Yet despite that, I liked that Val did have his limits. He drew the line at raping women or molesting little boys and girls like his father and the Lords of Chaos did. He also did what was necessary to protect his sister at great personal risk. Then we see this whole other side of Val, the boyish charmer who tinkers with clockwork toys, who loves books and has a gigantic library, and who seems completely entranced and intrigued by his Seraphine as he calls Bridget and wants to understand her morality. Val knows hes handsome and has a great body, and he isnt afraid to flaunt it, which gives a freedom to his character I found refreshing rather than merely conceited. And then theres his flamboyant style. His dress, his surroundings, even his speech on occasion can be overindulgent and poetic and by turns could both amuse and touch me. Everything about him is big and elaborate and fanciful, and yes, a bit selfcentered, but that only added to his freeness. He honestly doesnt care at all what other people think of him. In many ways, Val reminds me of Deadpool, because hes a little mad yet still oddly lovable, or Loki Elizabeth Hoyt herself has cast Tom Hiddleston as Val and I think hes a perfect choice, because hes a mischievous troublemaker yet still embodies a boyish charm that I couldnt help but love in spite of him doing bad things. Bridget is the perfect foil for Val, grounding him and giving his life purpose. The secret illegitimate daughter of a certain aristocratic lady who has been a part of the series from the beginning, Bridget was raised by a workingclass foster family due to the circumstances of her birth. She knows the value of hard work and has done just that to earn the position of head housekeeper at such a young age. She genuinely enjoys her work, but she came into Vals employ originally to use her position to seek out blackmail material he had on her biological mother and another aristocratic lady. Before meeting him in the flesh, Bridget thinks hes a nogood lowlife who only thinks of himself, but after he comes out of hiding, she begins to get to know the real man. She sees glimmers of goodness in him and wants to bring that out of him and show him theres a different path he can take that doesnt involve hurting people. There are times when Bridget bests Val at his own game, foiling his plots by taking away his playthings. At those times, I found it intriguing that Val is never truly mad at her when he catches her, because he views it as all part of the game, and if anything, he almost seems to respect her all the more for temporarily getting the upper hand. Despite Vals protestations that he doesnt have a heart, I adored Bridget for being perceptive enough to see that he does, as well as kind and loving enough to nurture the goodness she sees. Through her patient tutelage she genuinely makes him into a better man. There are several supporting characters in Duke of Sin who will be getting their own stories in the series or who already have. Bridgets biological family play roles, as does Hippolyta Royle, all of whom weve seen in several previous books. Hippolyta is one of the most soughtafter heiresses in England and her story continues from where it leaves off in this book, when she becomes the heroine of the next novella, Once Upon a Moonlit Night, which will be released this month July 2016. Were also introduced to Hugh Fitzroy, the kings illegitimate son and the one the crown sends to clean up problems that arise. He gets an inauspicious introduction to the street urchin, Alf, in this book. This pair will go on to become the hero and heroine of the next fulllength novel of the series, Duke of Pleasure, which is due for release in November 2016. Then there are the Lords of Chaos, whom I strongly suspect Ms. Hoyt patterned after the Hellfire clubs that were popular in the Georgian era. These dissolute aristocrats engage in all manner of heinous and debauched acts, and although they suffer a setback in this book, we havent heard the last of them, as they become the villains of Duke of Pleasure. Ms. Hoyt is equally as masterful at creating memorable animal characters as she is with her human ones, so Id be remiss if I didnt mention Bridgets little dog, Pip, whos absolutely adorable. I feel like Ive been saying this a lot lately, but I cant help it when its true. All of Elizabeth Hoyts books in her Maiden Lane series have been perfect or nearperfect reads for me, and Duke of Sin was no exception. I loved the story and the characters and think they were both expertly rendered. As usual the love scenes are sensual, steamy and creative. The romance is heartfelt and emotional. The mini fairy tale that accompanies it perfectly mirrors the main story. Everything about this book was spoton. I couldnt have asked for a better read and cant wait for the next stories in the Maiden Lane series. Im so excited to get two more yet this year. Yay!
This book deserves all the stars...but I need some time to collect my thoughts before writing my review because Im a blubbering mess right now. So review to come! Update 82916: See more reviews on my blog Novels and Necklaces In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me. Im going to start this review off with this statement: I didnt cry while I was reading this book, but I did cry several days later when I was looking back on Lilys story. That shows how emotionally charged this story is, along with the true power behind Colleens writing. Im not going to give away any spoilers because you need to go into the book blind. If you want to know what happens, there are definitely some reviews out there that tell you the big twists and turns. But take my advice and dont spoil this book for yourself. It will lose a lot if you go in knowing exactly what to expect. So seriously, dont do it to yourself. Just let the beauty of Colleens writing sweep over you and sink in. All humans make mistakes. What determines a persons character arent the mistakes we make. Its how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses. This is honestly not only one of the best reads of 2016, but also one of the most if not the most empowering. I want to give this book to every man, woman, and even teenager its definitely a NAadult read and tell them... READ THIS NOW! Do you want to know why? Because this book carries with it a very strong message, one that shows strength and courage that many people might not have at the time, but after reading will understand and gain. I honestly dont know if there has ever been a time when I was prouder to be reading the heroines story due to her choices. Ultimately though, Colleen Hoover wrote a book that everyone can take something away from. Colleen always writes such unique stories, and this one is certainly no exception. But the one thing I will say is that this is truly her best book yet. Just because someone hurts you doesnt mean you can simply stop loving them. Its not a persons actions that hurt the most. Its the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear. Lilys story is one that I never wanted to stop reading. If I know that Im going to need to read a book in multiple sittings which was the case with this book, I usually try to find a good place to stop. One in which, nothing major is happening and nobody is facing some drasticperilous moment. Well you see the problem with this book is the fact that there is literally NO. GOOD. STOPPING. POINT! None! There was never a part where I felt safe in letting this book sit overnight because I knew that the story and the what ifs would play endlessly in my mind. So I stayed up and read it all in one sitting because I simply couldnt stop. Lily was someone that I connected to right from the get go. I knew as soon as the book started that I would like her, and that never once stopped while I was reading. However, I didnt realize how much her character would affect me while I was reading. As I said before, after I was finished reading, I couldnt have been prouder of her decisions. The strength she had throughout the story to go through what she did, but also her resolve and conviction just made me constantly cheer her on. Lily is truly one of the most admirable characters that I have ever had the pleasure of reading about, and that admiration goes extraordinarily deep. Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldnt waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never. I mentioned it briefly above, but this book has a very powerful message, and this message is actually carefully woven into the story from page 1. You obviously dont realize it when you start reading the novel, but its there when you look back after finishing. And this is also why Im going to reiterate the importance of going into the story blind, because just as unexpected and emotional it is for the reader to read and witness what Lily goes through, it is even more unexpected and emotional for Lily. This is where this book truly shines, because you as a reader feel like part of the story. Theres a very slow burn while reading, one in which we get to know characters and see the develop in the ways that we as humans get to know each other...but then Colleen rips that metaphorical rug out from under all of us, and shocks us with one revelation after another. But you know what? Thats exactly how life is sometimes...sometimes you never see things coming in a million years and you have to figure out how to deal with these radical changes you never thought would happen. It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us. Where this book really got me though was the meaning of the title. Throughout the entire time I was reading, I kept wondering what the title meant. Because come on...this is Colleen Hoover and literally EVERYTHING has some significance no matter how small. And when I got to the part of the story where the title finally made sense, guys let me tell you...this had an impact on me like no other. I just sat there with my book in my hands staring at the page for a solid 5 minutes. It is the perfect title for the perfect book. Fifteen seconds. Thats all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that well never get back. I connected with this book in my own way, and for that I am extraordinarily thankful to Colleen Hoover for even writing this book. The authors note at the end was just as powerful and amazing as the rest of the story, but it shows just how personal this story was for her to write. I applaud Colleen for writing this book and not making things easy for the main character or glossing over the bad parts. This is an incredibly realistic book that makes you realize many things and leaves an imprint on your soul. Its important to remember that everyone must make extraordinarily difficult decisions in their life, and not everyone will agree with them. If this book even empowers one woman to take steps in making an important decision, the Colleen Hoover did her job. And I count myself lucky to have had the honor of reading this story because I am a changed person because of it! Happy reading :
 spoiler alert  Every single day, we dont realize how fortunate we are to still have time and another day to welcome us. Most of the people take it for granted and I dont deny the fact that I was once one of them. But after reading this book, my perspectives in life changed. I now started to appreciate everything around me. The scorching heat of the sun in the Philippines, rich green trees, the coldness of the air conditioner, the soft and comfortable feeling my bed gives me... I started to appreciate the rain that drops on the roof of my house and tapping on my windows, plopping itself with a soft plip plop, and even the voice of my noisy neighbor who is always in a megaphone. Now that Im thinking about it, I started to like everything around me that at first I dislike. Plot Summary: Samantha Sam Kingston is the fortunate girl in the world. She have everything hot boyfriend, popularity and always get the best among the rest. But on February 12, 12:39 AM, everything changed. Sam finds herself to wake up the day before, her alarm ringing, Izzy, her little sister waking her up, Lindsay, her best friend waiting for her outside her house... Everything started way back that morning. At first Sam was confused, she doesnt know what was happening, what was the purpose of this unexpected turn of time? Day after day passed by and always the morning of February 12, Cupids Day greeted her. She did a lot of things, and discovered some secrets thatll change her perspectives in life. She started to show more affection to her parents and to her little sister. She was still Samantha Kingston, but she had change for the better. And then, she realized, she never liked Rob, her long time crush since in sixth grade and is in love with Kent McFuller, her childhood best friend that she kissed in third grade, and is the only person who sees the true Sam. As time passed by, repeating of the history, Sam finally found the reason she was stuck in this day to save Juliet, the girl she and her friends Lindsay, Ally and Elody are tormenting since fifth grade and to change herself. She did many attempts to save her but failed. Not until the seventh day she repeated February 12. She gave Izzy the necklace her grandmother gave her, say I love you to her parents, spend all of her times with her best friends knowing itll be her last, break up with Rob, tell Kent her true feelings for him, having the best best friends group hug ever and promising theyll be BFFs till death do us part, enjoy the last party of her life and saved Juliets life. That seventh day was the happiest day of Sams life. She didnt regret she broke up with Rob. She didnt regret to be nice to everyone. She even didnt regret pushing Juliet out of the way of the truck and got hit instead. She didnt regret everything she did on that seventh repettition day of February 12. She finally had rest in peace knowing that everyone will remember her not as the popular Samantha Kingston, but the nice, kind and real Samantha Kingston that Kent had always seen. What I love about this book: The plot. Sure it can sometimes be predictable but it still have 85 originality in it. So inspiring, heartwarming and also heartbreaking. The characters. Theyre so amazing. I love how Lauren Oliver make her characters realistic. Who knows, maybe she was Samantha Kingston when she was in high school. :P Just kidding. The cover! It is catchy! Those blue green eyes staring back at you... So amazing! I can stare at them forever! The flow of the words. I love how Lauren Oliver wrote this book. The words, adjectives, conjunctions, nouns, adverbs they all flow perfectly like water rushing from the river to the waterfall. So, so, so awesome! Almost everything! All I can say is, Lauren Oliver did a really excellent job on her first YA novel! What I dislike about this book: ProfanityCussingSwearing. I have always hated these. In my place, we call it bad words. I know that its a part of teenage lifeblah blah blahstuff but I still hate it. If it isnt for the plot, characters, cover and many more I would have given it four stars because of this. Some stuff not for the minors below 18! I know that sometimes its just a sexy joke, part of an eighteen year old lifeblah blah blahits still NOT appropriate for readers below 18! Not all YA readers like these stuffs! Im a conservative person thats why I dont like it. Opinions about this book: This. Book. Changed. My. Perspectives. In. Life. Just like I said at the top, this book it really heartwarming, inspiring and heartbreaking. If you put aside the bad language and some stuff not suitable for minors, it is an amazing book. It makes you see life in a different way youve never done before. It makes you see positive things thatll surely brighten your day. After reading this, I just realize how fortunate we all are. Every day, many people die around the world. We are lucky to be able to see the sun rise in the clear blue sky. Thank you God, thank you. It. Is. Also. Heartbreaking. I can already imagine Kent, crying over Sams body wishing for a miracle that shell be alive and tell his name or kiss him one last time. Kent doesnt deserve this! The only thing good that happened in his life was Sam returning his feelings. But did she really have to die a few moments after having the best and last kiss of her life? starts crying I cried at the epilogue. But at least, Sam died seeing Kents green eyes one last time and Juliets face that looked like an angel to her. bites lip BUT this is YA world! It CAN be fictional! There shouldve been a miracle! Like Sam heard a deep voice saying You have proven yourself. Im giving you two choices: To die and stay here or to return to Earth. And then Sam will remember her friends back on Earth especially Kent and will choose the second one. And then itll be on Kents POV. Sam will wake up, theyll have a reunion, Juliet changed her life, everyone started to be nice happy ending! I know that it sounds ridiculous but its the only thing that makes me happy to think about. I HATE TRAGEDIES even if I write tragic stories. Over all, I really enjoyed the book explaining why I only read it in one day. Ill totally buy a copy of this in the nearest book store and reread it for another time. For Samantha Kingston: Samantha Sam Kingston, you had done many mistakes before and experienced a lot of things. You deserve to have another day, another time. If only I can give you time, I will. But I cant. You are an amazing girl. You changed yourself to be a better person and I am thankful that accident and repetition of the morning of February 12 happened to you. If it didnt, youll still be snobby Sam. You inspire not only me but also the other readers of your life. Yes, Samantha Sam Kingston, youll always be remembered in everyones heart and soul. May you rest in peace.
Originally reviewed here  Angieville I thought I was done with the crying when I finished The Raven King last night at an only slightly ungodly hour. But then this morning I got up and I just didnt know what to do. And when I realized I had to sit down and write about how this book made me feel, the tears start welling up again. Honestly, Aaron will likely never let me read another series aloud to him again for all the tears he carefully wiped off my cheeks with this one. I am not a huge book crier as a rule, and I did not cry reading the other three. But it wasnt so much the sadness as it was the saying goodbye. I hate saying goodbye. Even though I am a serial rereader, there is no escaping that particular goodbye that comes at the end of a series that has meant . . . more than a lot. That contains characters I have loved the precise way I have loved these ones. These boys. That Blue. This incredible writing that makes me want to prowl the streets at night reciting passages aloud to the stars. I hated waking up this morning. Because it meant we all had to move on. And I really didnt know what to do. I just cant see any way to avoid all the spoilers at this point, lovelies. But I do try. We have arrived at the final volume. Vos admonitos. Richard Gansey III knows. He knows this is the closest hes ever been, or may ever be, to finding Glendower. He knows if he doesnt take matters into his own hands, Ronan Lynch will most definitely not graduate Aglionby Academy. He knows the precise texture and feel of Blue Sargents laughter on his skin. He knows Adam Parrishs bargain with the mystical forest Cabeswater could play out in even more heretofore unexpected ways than it already has. And he knows the odds are better than even he may not survive to see any of these things happen. But, being Gansey, he presses forward nonetheless, determined to find his sleeping king, extract his favor, and see the friends he loves so well possessed of the things they need to survive with or without him. And, to his continual if grateful bemusement, so do said friends. Even as a preponderance of ruthless personages come to roost in Henrietta. Even as Gansey and Blue continue to bash up against the wall that is telling their friends about their feelings for one another. Even as Ronan spends more and more time at the Barns, Adam spends more and more time with Ronan, and both of them spend more and more time within the darkening vines of Cabeswater. Even as an unusual and overeager classmate makes indefatigable advances on the tightknit group as a whole, And so, reinforced as they are by each other, they draw inexorably closer to the uncertain fate that has always awaited them. Depending on where you begin the story, its about my undying love for Ronan Lynch. Ever since the very first pages of The Raven Boys, I have loved Ronan. In English. In Latin. In every single one of the languages on his crazy puzzle box. And I cant help but be utterly unsurprised and proud, in an odd way at how this final volume seemed to say so much of it was Ronans story at heart. Of all the options in the world, Ronan Lynch was the most difficult version of any of them. Depending on where you begin the story, its about my gutwrenching love for Adam Parrish. Adam, too, I fell in love with on contact. While others have questioned his choices, his motivations, his endless stubborn drive and solitude, I have soaked up every one. If I had the most fears and questions when it came to Adams fate, it was because I unquestionably identify with him the most. Need was Adams baseline, his resting pulse. Love was a privilege. Adam was privileged; he did not want to give it up. He wanted to remember again and again how it felt. But no matter where you begin the story, its about Maggie Stiefvaters astounding skill with words, her characters that live and breathe so loudly and fiercely that they feel inviolably real, and the marvelous story in which they are entwined. The Raven King clocks in at a perfectly healthy 438 pages, and it feels funny to say that the entirety of those unfold at a breakneck pace. There are, of course, those trademark moments of indolent splendor, of quiet breaths held and exhaled. But I maintain, the experience of reading the novel remains one of rushing toward a conclusion no one, the reader least of all, is prepared for. But it comes. It comes. It comes. In the sweetest and gentlest of exchanges between Gansey and Blue. In the terrifying and violent passes through Cabeswater. In the exquisite light of fireflies dotting the air around the Barns as words rise up and burst inside Ronan. If The Dream Thieves made it possible for me to love and follow Gansey by showing me why each of the boys and Blue loved and followed him, The Raven King shows Gansey why. And it was such a beautiful artistic choicehere at the endto show the king just what he had wrought. To hold the mirror in all its forms up, so that he could see the beautiful and strange constellation he and his quest had made of their lives. I wanted so much. I wanted, I wanted. And even though the previous books in the series taught me to be afraid on all possible fronts, there were moments in this one that gave me new reasons. There were also moments that surpassed my expectation with their perfect rightness. And there were new gifts, given at a point when I thought I had passed the time when I could ask for more. But I should have known better. When it comes to Stiefvaters writing and this series, there is always more. The point was the longing, the packing into a single book, into a single series, the feeling of knowing and of being known. The feeling of finding, of waking, of wanting, of home.
Mild SPOILERS herein, big ones under a cut... 10 Magnificent Bastard stars! Hooboy, that was a book. Far and away one of the best books I have ever read, ever. It was completely riveting, smart, hilarious as hell, and disturbing as all get out. But it was not a romance by any stretch. Joe is not a hero. If there is any question about that, it needs to be dispelled right away. And once those facts are accepted, you can read the book for what it is: a brilliant, almost satirical thriller that makes cutting observations about all that is fake and plastic about our socialmedia existence, with some sexy times and murder thrown in. There need not be any guilt about rooting for Joe despite his homicidal mania because the book is cleverly designed to MAKE you root for him. But rooting for him and hoping he gets his HEA are two very different things. I stayed with Joe but I never once wanted him to get what he wanted. I wanted to see him in jail or a psych hospital or both but that doesnt mean it wasnt a thrill ride along the way. A romantic hero he is not. The first time Joe finally manages to finagle sex with the heroine, he lasts all of eight seconds. I cant help but feel this is Kepnes testing us. A reminder See? she says. Some hero Joe is. I loved it. Joe Goldberg works in a bookstore where he makes biting, sharp commentary in his mind about his customers based on who they read. Such as the guy who buys real literature and is ashamed of the Dan Brown he buries at the bottom of his basket. Already this sets up the theme of loving what we love and being ashamed of it. Of needing to put up a false front of intellectualism to hide the fact we sometimes just want a fun piece of entertainment. Of saying one thing forthebenefitofothers but meaning something totally different IRL. It is no accident that a Holden Caulfield hunters cap, such as the one he wore in Catcher in the Rye, features prominently in this book. An homage to that iconic character who was broken down by the phoniness he saw all around him, even in a time before Facebook and selfies and shared photos of the lunch we ate today. This book asks what is real? What is fake? How much of our outward social media life is true to us and how much is manufactured to give the worldclose friends and BFs tooa certain impression of who we are? This novel is bursting at the seams with pop culture references that serve to show us what buffers they are to the real us. The books we read, the shows we watch, the movies that mean something...all of it is on the slab in this book. The worst characters here are the fakest, those who are barricaded behind their snotty ideals about what is importantart and what is not. Including our heroine. Joe becomes immediately attracted to customer Guinevere Beck, an aspiring writerMFA student, who goes by her last name. She is the YOU of of the 2nd person perspective that this book is written in. The entire novel is an ode to Beck; part love letter, part diatribe...a running monologue of obsession. Joe manages to secure Becks cellphone and hacks all of her accounts, giving him access to her entire life. If this book were boring or trite or contrived, Beck would be an angel, someone you constantly fear for and pity. She would be a doting girlfriend to Joe but then it wouldnt be a very fun book. Beck is horribly flawed which is one of the many reasons you root for Joe. She is inconstant, flaky, selfabsorbed, neurotic...etc. She has facetoface interactions with Joe, and then she hasas many of us doa social media life that is completely different. Her onagain, offagain relationship with Joe is infuriating in its inconsistency, esp given that we are privy to her duplicity via that stolen cellphone. Joe is patient with Beck. Almost to the point of being a doormat. He puts up with her inconstancy with a heroic amount of patience and selfrestraint, esp given hes read the truth behind her lies or silence via her hacked emails. Outwardly, he is a paragon of chivalry while stalking her obsessively behind the scenes. At one point he follows her to a Dickens festival, dressed in full period garb and a beard to disguise himself. He stalks her the entire time but his rationale is so hilariously sociopathic. I know when you need your space. Thats why I got the beard. To an outward observer, he is the perfect guy: listens, doesnt push or pressure Beck while she constantly puts him second to her horrible, awful, nogood friends and the ridiculously selfabsorbed hipsterBenjishe is sometimes involved with. And herein lies the key manner in which Kepnes makes you root for Joe: by populating the book with the most odious characters you love to hate. You WANT Joe to off these bastards and end their overly phony, narcissistic existences. These friendslovers of Becks are obstacles in Joes way and he dispatches them one after the other on the road to having her all to himself, and the reader thinks, YES! Hes awful. Shes the worst. Go, Joe! But in reality that makes Joe a murderer, not a romantic hero, despite our preexisting inclinations to maybe think of him as such, esp if romance is ones primary genre. That is the duality of this book. Kepnes is a brilliant puppeteer, manipulating the reader to stay with Joe, even when his actions are abhorrent, by keeping us teetering on the edge of what we feel is real close to our everyday experiences and then taking it over the top. murder Aside: The best character, imho, is Karen Minty. She watches the King of Queens and she loves it without pretense or apology. She is brash and honest and completely lacking in facade. She is the only character in the entire novel who has integrity...which is why she cant hold a candle to Beck. Beck is just as phony as the friends Joe kills to get to her, but he loves that about her. He loveseverything about her But he doesnt kill her friends because of their phoniness, he kills them because they have USED their phoniness to hold and keep Becks devotion. They are distractions that keep Beck from giving 100 of herself to Joe. He is sure of it. And Joe is just as fake as his victims, putting on outward display of sanity while inwardly hes a murdering psycho. Joe is NO BETTER than his victims in fact. hes demonstrably worse but we root for him because their brand of phoniness is closer to our own reality. We all know people who talk artisanal cheese while Tweeting with an excessive amount of bullshit hashtags. Hell, we do it ourselves to a degree. Joe murders the worst of the social mediaworst, and so we love him for it. But he is just as absorbed in his own way. Hes the ultimate hypocrite. This book is brilliant. The writing is sharp as a knife, and the finale is genius. Just at the exact moment we see Joe exert violence on Beckthe very moment in which we are supposed to finally say, Enough is enough. Youre a bad guy, Joe. At that precise moment it is revealed she has been cheating on him which takes us across the denouement with the thinnest shred that its still okay to root for Joe. But read it as what it is: a satire on this modern world, on obsession, narcissism, and as a pageturning thriller that, along with his victims, we should love to hate, not worship as a romantic hero.
So, yeah this book was pretty sweet. It was one of those cases where the reality managed to live up to the hype...a rare case as far as my experience goes. In a nutshell the premise of the book, on the off chance that you didnt already know, is that a lone astronaut is inadvertently left stranded on the red planet after a catastrophic accident leaves his crewmates believing he is dead. Coming to alone and marooned millions of miles from home Mark Watney is left with the choice to try and fight nearly impossible odds to survive or give up and die alone on an alien world. Given the circumstances he finds himself in I think most of us would inevitably fall into the latter course sooner or later. We come to find, however, that Mark is the kind of man who doesnt take failure lightly. Taken at its most basic level I guess one could boil the story down to the movie Gravity meets Robinson Crusoe, but, as with all analogies of this kind, taking that too far would be doing the book a disservice. While I found Gravity visually stimulating I thought it was pretty bland as a story and The Martian is anything but bland. There were enough ups and downs in the plot itself to keep me excited and wondering just how the hell the most recent crisis was going to be resolved. Ultimately though, the question of what makes this book work so well comes down to two words: Mark Watney. Our intrepid hero and narrator is an ingenious astronaut with a penchant for botany and engineering whose sharp wit and neversaydie attitude manage to be uplifting without being cloying. And he can bring the funny. I found myself smiling often and even laughing out loud much more than is normal for me when reading. When it comes down to brass tacks Mark Watney is a truly likable protagonist and Im not sure I could say that I found the aforementioned Robinson Crusoe half so charming. I had the audiobook version and must say first off that the narration by R. C. Bray was great. He hit the humour notes just right and did a pretty good job with accent and voice shifts where required, though his female characters did end up sounding pretty samey...though Im not sure if theres an easy way around that for a male narrator short of caricature. Id be curious to see if the humour works as consistently for me with the print version given Brays excellent delivery. I cant really go into too much detail on the plot since I think that the surprises in store for the reader are integral to ones enjoyment of the story. Suffice it to say that the sometimes actual shit is often hitting the mostly proverbial fan and its up to our intrepid astronaut to try and find a clever way out of problems that threaten to end his life nearly every day. While I dont doubt that every single obstacle Watney had to face was an actual one in the sense that they were all real issues a man stranded on Mars would have to face some of the crises occasionally bordered on predictable as I knew by the pacing of the story when we were due for a new catastrophe, but thats a pretty small nit to pick. One other related problem I had with the book was the sheer amount and detail involved in the technical information Watney provides for each crisis throughout the book. I think for the most part these details were necessary, especially given the conceit that the bulk of the book was made up of log entries by Watney where he would obviously want to be pretty scrupulous in detailing exactly what he was doing for posterity. Still, I often found myself rewinding in order to try and get my head around all of the minutiae I was given...I wasnt always completely successful at getting the full nuance of things hey, I got an Arts degree, ok?, but I generally got the gist. As implied a lot of these explanations border on the territory of infodumps, something that usually makes me break out in hives, but in this case I would have to admit that the structure of the narrative and manner of their insertion made them seem much more like valid requirements of the story itself as opposed to merely being literary wanking by the author. While I still didnt like the fact that I was often at a loss for exactly what was being expressed the first time I heard it I readily admit that without these details the reality of Watneys situation, as well as their ultimate repercussions, would have been pretty vague instead of vivid and visceral. Ultimately this book is all about the human ability to come up with creative solutions in order to overcome adversity...and the adversity comes pretty hard  fast. Basically anything that can go wrong will and the real burden on suspension of disbelief lies on the reader being willing to accept that Mark Watney is clever enough to think his way out of them consistently. It means we have to accept that Watney is enough of a specialist that he can come up with pretty difficult sciencebased solutions without needing to consult unavailable resources, but also that hes enough of a generalist to be able to solve problems outside of a limited range of knowledge. To be fair he does get some help from NASA at certain points of the story, but for the most part hes on his own. The book also relies heavily on the belief in the power of positive thinking...something I have to admit Im not always in line with, but for anyone without the optimistic outlook of Watney day 1 or I should say Sol 6 would have been the end of the story. One character even comments on the fact that Its amazing how much red tape gets cut when everyones rooting for one man to survive and I have to admit that the cynic in me wonders how much time and effort the powers that be would really be willing to spend on behalf of one man, and whether they might not allow some accident to occur so they could simply pull the plug on the whole operation and spin the event as an inescapable tragedy once the costs became apparent. At first I thought the book might wear a little thin if all we were doing was listening to Watney monologue about his lone existence on Mars, but not only is he a rather charming narrator, Weir was also able to expand the story beyond Watney himself to include other characters affected by his predicament no spoilers! and I often found myself looking forward to these segments away from Mars and felt like they allowed me to have a bit of a break from the marooned astronaut so that when we did return to him I felt like I was coming back to him with a fresh attitude and his story never grew stale. I certainly learned the important lesson that if youre ever trapped on Mars you must never forget to bring some serious scientific knowhow and a cando attitude. Oh, and lots of duct tape!
WHY DID I PUT Shades of Earth OFF FOR FIFTEEN DAYS?!!! ARGHHH! Yes. Fifteen days is a long time to put off a book that was number five on your ten most anticipated books of the year. And a book that. Was. Just. Soooooooo. Good. And evil! And Good! No... IT WAS AWESOME! What is in our hearts is real whether we name it or let it exist only in darkness or silence. Okay. So. Beth Revis is evil ... a genius ... an evil genius. Why cant all YA authors be like her? Seriously. All those other authors need to step up to the plate and show some true bravery and release their inner madwoman. Its the words written by the psychopath side of you that will surprise whoever reads your book. Its true. Thats something that will make me buy and read a book immediately. Speculating about what might happen would just be a huge waste of time and preparing yourself is the best that you can do  I knew since Across the Universe that Beth Reviss books are just those you have to prepare for. But in Shades of Earth, I didnt even think to prepare myself  there was no time to. Revis  literally  blew my mind before I had time to prepare my fortifications and protect what little innocence I had left. Her fiery barrages of surprises, twists and turns, smouldered that innocence to ash. Across the Universe introduced us to Godspeed, to its functioning and purpose, to Amy and Elder, and to a mysterious and thrilling new story in space. A Million Suns raised the stakes aboard Godspeed higher, tearing the civilians in two, while more revelations about Godspeed came to light. Shades of Earth raises the stakes even higher, as high as they can possibly go, as high as the tallest building in the world. Yeah, thats high. In Shades of Earth we see the shuttle with Amy and Elder, the thousandandsomething other Godspeedians, and the eightyorso cryogenically frozen people land on CentauriEarth despite a few malfunctions. Once they land a number of events occur... And thats where Ill stop... Shades of Earth is no happily ever after. What I wouldve liked to have seen is much more of Centauri Earth and the creatures that inhabit it. There certainly was quite a few twists in what little we did see of it, but just more of it wouldve been nice. Despite that, the world building is pretty incredible. Amy and Elder, the shipboards and the Earthborns, had no idea what they were getting into, had no idea what Centauri Earth is like. So Shades of Earth was quite an absorbing book as we discovered this new planet  or like I said, this corner of it  at the same time the characters did. Revis instills fear in the reader just as she instills fear in her characters, experiencing things together at the same time. So much has happened to these characters weve grown to love or despise since Across the Universe to the end of Shades of Earth. I feel like theres much more that can happen in this universe, on this planet, with how the trilogy concluded. Beth Revis could write another trilogy or other books, further expanding, further developing, further exploring the entirety of CentauriEarth. I have already in my dreams thought about story lines that could be written postShades of Earth, story lines that a season 4, a season 5, a season 6 could possibly use if these books were ever adapted for the TV. Id even alter the very ending of Shades of Earth so that the story would further develop and continually roll out the surprises that Beth Revis is known for. If Im given the opportunity to adapt these books to the TV I would do it with dignity, with respect, with a love for the source material. But I digress. The plot in Shades of Earth continually evolved, continually kept you questioning, on your feet, running, hiding, gasping for air, in astonishment, in terror, in shock. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! this book went, the explosions galore helping me since I did not have to shave before work the next day. The trilogy arc is something Ive been quite impressed with  one of the best Ive ever had the pleasure of reading. Whoever at RazorbillPenguin told Beth Revis that the story could develop after Across the Universe, whoever pushed Beth Revis to write another two books, whoever believed in Beth Revis and her divine storytelling and the potential in life after Across the Universe should be awarded a medal of some kind. Seriously. Revis had a plan since the start and it ended in ways I did not expect. Shades of Earth was an explosive conclusion, raining down revelations and debris all around. I must add something that I took notice of and must spotlight. There was this new character Adam. He was made to be a new love interest for Amy, someone to cause tension and conflict between Amy and Elder. But to be honest, whoever calls that a love triangle is seriously mistaken. Yes, she was attracted to his looks. Yes, she flirted. Yes, they spent some time together. But there was a moment where Adam leaned in towards Amy to give her a kiss. But Amy refused it, turning her head away. I had always loved Amy since the beginning, but this moment proved that she was mature, not constantly seeking attention, not wanting to make out and be with every guy she finds attractive under the sun. Because she is with Elder. And Elder is with her. This shows that shes headstrong. This shows that shes loyal  to Elder, as well as to others. It was a trait of hers that I found to be the most memorable. I guess I have to talk about Elder now too? Well, Elder was great. He was loyal, driven, brave, and determined to protect Amy and everyone, even those he had rivalled with in the past, putting himself in harms way for the betterment of everybody else. He was a hero; she was a heroine. Together they were gold. I learned that life is so, so fragile. I learned that you can know someone for just days and never forget the impression he left on you. I learned that art can be beautiful and sad at the same time. I learned that if someone loves you, hell wait for you to love him back. I learned that how much you want something doesnt determine whether you get it or not, that no might not be enough, that life isnt fair, that my parents cant save me, that maybe no one can. The conclusion to this trilogy is one not be missed. Although it might leave you with post traumatic stress disorder for the rest of your life, Shades of Earth is worth it. Whatever other book Beth Revis comes out with will be worth it. Being Beth Revis right at this moment would be a pretty good feeling. If I ever meet Beth... When I meet Beth... oh, man, I cannot fathom not meeting Beth and not being able to stroke the head that holds that brain built from epicness, the brain that produced such an awesome trilogy that is the Across the Universe trilogy. Hi, Beth! ... ... ... ... flails  fuckfuckfuckityfuckfuck.... i hate the new covers; I DESPISE THEM! Hopefully UK covers continue the same way they were going so at least my original hardcovers can match in SOME way. Edit: THANK YOU to the UK publisher for creating a cover along the same lines as the original two, and although its a bit different its at least much closer to the originals than the US redesigned. Ive been seeing pictures of the physical copy of the hardcover and I must say its not as bad as the so called powers of the internet perceive it to be like.
4.5 stars. Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog The StarTouched Queen by Roshani Chokshi Publisher: St. Martins Griffin Publication Date: April 26, 2016 Rating: 4 stars Source: eARC from NetGalley Summary from Goodreads: Cursed with a horoscope that promises a marriage of Death and Destruction, sixteenyearold Maya has only earned the scorn and fear of her fathers kingdom. Content to follow more scholarly pursuits, her world is upheaved when her father, the Raja, arranges a wedding of political convenience to quell outside rebellions. But when her wedding takes a fatal turn, Maya becomes the queen of Akaran and wife of Amar. Yet neither roles are what she expected. As Akarans queen, she finds her voice and power. As Amars wife, she finds friendship and warmth. But Akaran has its own secrets  thousands of locked doors, gardens of glass, and a tree that bears memories instead of fruit. Beneath Akarans magic, Maya begins to suspect her life is in danger. When she ignores Amars plea for patience, her discoveries put more than new love at risk  it threatens the balance of all realms, human and Otherworldly. Now, Maya must confront a secret that spans reincarnated lives and fight her way through the dangerous underbelly of the Otherworld if she wants to protect the people she loves. Inspired by Indian mythology. What I Liked: The StarTouched Queen is one of my most anticipated debuts of 2016  and novels of 2016 in general. Its one of those books that seem brilliant and a musthave, given a gorgeous synopsis, genre, and cover. Everything about this book appealed to me since I heard about it, so you best be sure I was both excited and nervous to start reading it. But Im really happy that this book did not disappoint! The stars have cursed Mayavati her whole life. With a dark horoscope hanging over her head, she knows that she is destined to have a marriage of death. Maya is comfortable with not marrying anyone, but a sudden turn of events changes everything, and Maya finds herself married to the Raja of Akaran, Amar. Akaran is part of the Otherworld, and Amar is no mere mortal. Maya will soon understand what it means to be the Rani of Akaran  for better and for worse. First thing Id like to gush about  the Indian influence! Im Indian so Im very excited about the Indian mythology and culture so heavily infused into this book. FINALLY, we have a female protagonist who isnt some goldenskinned beauty  Maya captures a somewhat typical Indian girl of dark skin. And while the concept of an arranged marriage is somewhat present in the book, I love that it is not the cliche that we usually see in Indiabased books. So often authors will pick and choose certain aspects of Indian culture to write about  or exaggerate  and often its arranged marriages. There is so much more to Indian history and culture! I think the author did an excellent job with the diversity. Usually Im not interested in stories that deal with reincarnation, whether in a major way, or tangentially. However, I love the aspect in this story. At one point in the story, Maya gets to see all of her past reincarnations, and its a beautiful thing. I really liked Maya, though not necessarily at first. At first, I was wary of her; she put too much stock into her horoscope, and she let all of the harem wives get under her skin, even after so many years of the snide comments. But I like how Maya embraced her horoscope, and how she took charge of her destiny when she meets Amar. Everything changes when she meets Amar. Amar is somewhat of a static character in the book. Hes kind of onedimensional and not entirely there. Its obvious that he does not share the story with Maya, in that it is not his story to tell or his character that is developing. This story is solely about Maya and her journey, and Amar plays a role. I wish we got to know a deeper, more personal side to Amar. I liked Amar a lot and would have loved to understand better, and get to know more personal details about him. Amar is sweet and protective, yet secretive and mysterious. This story had a Hades and Persephone feel to it hence why Im tagging it as a retelling. Amar did not kidnap Maya to the Otherworld, but by her going with him, she agrees to rule the Otherworld with him. And what she finds in the Otherworld, and the Night Bazaar, isnt what she expected. Learning about Akaran is difficult, as is staying away from temptation. I liked the romance! Its a linear one no love triangle, and the story takes place over many years Amar and Maya dont age in the Otherworld, so while we may not see all of the development of the relationship, we know that they spend a long time getting to know each other. Parts of their story are so heartbreaking, and other parts are so happy and sweet. I lived for the sweet moments! I love the cadence of the story. I was never bored, and the author always had me turning pages and eagerly awaiting the next scene. I picked up this book in the height of midterms, and yet, I could not put it down and thats saying something  usually Im very disciplined when it comes to midterms and studying. Overall, I was swept away by this beautiful story. Its a standalone, and certainly wraps up like one. I was satisfied with the ending, though I can see why the author is writingwrote a companion novel to follow in a different characters perspective. I cant wait to read her story! What I Did Not Like: I already talked about this a little above, but I wish Amar was less static and onedimensional. Maybe it was just me that saw him that way. We dont get a ton of backstory about him, besides some of his interactions with Maya. And he never quite felt real to me, just a man filling a certain role. He literally could be anyone, any face, any male. I also wish there were more AmarMaya moments! Trust me, they spend years together they dont age in the Otherworld, so we know that all these swoony and cute moments exist theoretically, but we only get to see... a bare minimum. Like, less than five, I think. Not enough! More swoon and fire would have been great! Would I Recommend It: I highly recommend this novel! Its a beautiful and heartbreaking and lovely story with a very satisfying ending. Chokshi hit all of my feels with this book, and took my emotions on a rollercoaster. I certainly wasnt expecting that! I liked this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone who likes YA fantasy andor mythology! Rating: 4 stars. This novel did not disappoint me at all. I look forward to reading the companion novel that characters story is going to be fantastic, I can feel it!, as well as more books by the author in the future!
An Essayish Piece on the Prescience of To Kill A Mockingbird w special regards to Louis CK. Its a great life. You get to eat, you get to fuck, you get to read To Kill a Mockingbird Louis CK. Theres little occasion other than this quote that has me expelling my thoughts and reviews on this book. Part of humors power is that its linked to shared experience and many people have read To Kill a Mockingbird. And while its a little absurd that the three great things in life are eating, orgasms and reading one particular book, the simplicity of the statement and how much good stuff is within those three things gives the listener that really fuzzy good feeling. Okay but so what? He arbitrarily threw out a book that is universally lauded But lets explore why exactly this book is so universally lauded. Mostly for its moral message. The general consensus is that TKAMs greatness was written in a time when the civil right movement was being discussed nationally. It ends up having a prescience but also a prophetic effect: the goodness of characters like Atticus Finch is the attitude we as modern, wellread Americans being something we at the very least believe and would like to think that we embody. Atticus is the character to aspire to without pretension, just plain goodness in his intents and actions. And but also its a story about lost innocence. Secretly I think we and I strongly include myself in this we like stories about lost innocence because of the nostalgia that we get to experience vicariously through the characters. Nostalgia ought to be trademarked Made in the USA everytime it appears in text because we thrive on that here in the States. Its many years later and we are likely to cite that this book is so good because of the time period in which it was released. That it would come out and there might be a reasonable swath of educated wellread people that would have been hurt by it and accused Harper Lee of being a nigger lover or something to that effect. Perhaps thats part of it, but I submit that the core moral message we all know and love at the center of To Kill A Mockingbird is as prescient and important now as it was when it was published. Its 2013 Why Are We Still... The following is that whole rhetorical opening to pointing out how we as a supposedly advanced either empathicallysociallymorally or technologically speaking society are still doing arcane things. Like why are there still racists? Why are people still against gay marriage? Why Do We Still Have Such A Bonor For Oil and Oil Rich Countries? and etc. Theyre all fine points, but a larger point is glazed over. As though somehow somewhere down the line we were supposed to have figured this all out by now. Point of fact: humans are slow to change. Need this be news? Thats two 70year old ladies living and dying back to back. Thats how long ago you could buy a guy. Louis CK Theres a false consciousness with the above bolded header that we figure out and then quickly put into practice new ideals. For most of our existence humans have been shitty to each other explicitly or implicitly. Like if you were from the other side of the river at one point it was considered good behavior for the folks on the other side to murder you. Weve sacrificed live women on the basis that theyve presumably never had sex because we were hungry and wanted our crops to grow. Some religions to this day emphasize on the some, and emphasizing that people within religions dont adhere 100 to the institutional beliefs reinforce the idea that most of the people living and that have lived are going to hellsome kind of eternal fiery damnation. This needs to be pointed out because the larger context of TKAM doesnt actually have to do with the specific instance of institutional racism, but of basic human selfishness. What kept people alive in a very base way was valuing their lives more than others. The cost of happiness oftentimes more immediate happiness has been to subjugate and dehumanize. Thats been standard operating procedure. Theres something about empathy thats so totally unutilitarianin its best of intentions. The realer more enduring idea of empathy not being so much if I treat him nicely hell do the same thing for me. but because its right. Or as Atticus puts it under the guise of courage, Its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You treat people decently even though you might suffer for it. Ken Robinson once asked one of his audiences Are we fallen angels or risen apes? rhetorically pointing out that we did not start out as a species a priori with these ideas that all humans are created equal. This is a development in human nature and something that we yes even the educated, wellread among us fail to treat each others as equals on a daily basis. Again, its not always as large as institutional racism though as an American I could easily point out my complicitness in neocolonialism. Sometimes its the little hate thoughts and ill wills we have when a person cuts us off or perhaps its splitting the bill with a person when you know damn well you have enough to cover all of it. Or whatever. Being good and moral human beings is a process that is continually getting ironed out. Its not as though when one of us arrives at a reasonable moral conclusion, the whole race has advanced. This is the real value of TKAMs moral compass. An ordinary man steps away from his natural default setting, or at least the natural default setting of his community and does something decent and good. It is true that Atticus is not even the main character, but his actions largely inform his children and how they move through life. At the heart of TKAM Harper Lee understands the immense gravity of the ideal all men are created equal. Remember that when those words were written slavery was still institutionalized. Remember that the sons of those founding fathers nearly tore themselves apart over that same issue eighty years later. Remember that for this country to be conceived in liberty the same fathers and sons exterminated the people already here and that good and decent people walked the earth and could or would not do anything to stop it. Being equal often means stooping to conquer, not simply elevating the downtrodden. It means agreeing to take on the hopeless cases and allowing your stature to be diminished to a nigger lover in hopes that your example will prevent your race re all humans, not a color of skin from being diminished. And thats kind of why it really is great, on par with sex and food really, to read To Kill A Mockingbird.

Shazi is determined to figure out the reason behind the deaths of all the girls that came before her, and hopefully she can stop it from happening to anyone else! I have always been drawn to strong female characters in books. The ones that know how to take care of themselves, and dont take crap from anyone. Shazi definitely fits into this mold. She is a feisty girl that has tons of wit and intelligence. It is obvious she will go to great lengths for the people she cares about, she is putting her life in grave danger to avenge her best friend. She has so many amazing qualities, but she also has her faults as well. She tends to like things done her way, and at times she makes some really rash decisions that lead to serious consequences. But she takes everything in stride and never gives up no matter how difficult her situation becomes. I honestly adore her character and cant wait to read more of her story. Khalid is a very interesting character. He is extremely mysterious and at first he comes across as a coldhearted man that cares for no one. But as the story progresses and you learn about his sad past, its hard not to fall head over heels for him. It turns out he is a very caring person and he has this charm about him that is hard to resist. His relationship with Shazi is explosive, sexy, and tender. I loved watching them fall in love and try to figure each other out. Khalid is a great dynamic character and I am really intrigued to see what happens with him next. As you can tell I loved Khalid, but I will admit that I am torn when it comes to the two boys. Tariq and Shazi grew up together and they have a lot of history. I have always been a sucker for best friend romances and theirs is pretty adorable. Tariq is so loyal to Shazi and would do anything to keep her safe. That kind of commitment is hard to come by and the fact that he is gorgeous, charming, and has a great body doesnt hurt either. He just seems like the full package and that has made it really hard for me to pick a team. So as of right now I am going to call a truce between the two and hopefully I will be persuaded to pick one or the other in the sequel. The Wrath and the Dawn is a gorgeous mystical retelling of A Thousand and One Nights. The beginning did start a little slow for me, but once things picked up I was hooked. I adored the Arabian setting and it seems to be a theme this year in YA. So far this is the only one I have read, but trust me when I say it is a book you need to read. The characters are very interesting and easy to connect with. The plot was very intriguing and keeps you guessing until the very end. The romance was done beautifully and developed perfectly. It had some moments that will pull at your heart strings, but there was also great humor that helped to lighten the mood. If you cant tell I really enjoyed this story. It was so well rounded and contained all of the things that make a book wonderful. Yes, there were a few times the story seemed to drag and I got frustrated with the characters sometimes, but in the end this was an amazing read. I would highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for an engrossing young adult fantasy filled with epic romance, loveable characters, and a suspenseful plot! Notable Scene: A guard reached for her arm. When his hand closed around her wrist, Shahrzad saw the caliphs features tighten. She yanked her arm from the guards grasp, as though it were a flame held too near her flesh. Dont touch me! she yelled. When another guard seized her shoulder, she slapped his hand out of the way. Are you deaf? How dare you touch me? Do you know who I am? A note of panic entered her voice. Not knowing what else to do, she locked upon her enemy. The tigereyes were ... torn. Wary. And then? Calm. General alKhoury? Yes, sayyidi. Id like to introduce you to the Mountain of Adamant. The shahrban stared back and forth between the caliph and Shahrzad. But, sayyidi ... I dont understand. You cannot The caliph swiveled to face the shahrban. Youre right, General. You do not understand. And you may never understand. Regardless, Id like to introduce you to the Mountain of Adamant ... The caliph glanced back at Shahrzad, a ghost of a smile playing across his lips. My queen. FTC Advisory: I purchased my own copy of The Wrath and the Dawn. No goody bags, sponsorships, material connections, or bribes were exchanged for my review.
Controversial when published in 1962 and still viewed as the same today Its been a while since Ive written anything akin to a book review  Im rusty and not using a thesaurus. What a catharsis this has been, or repression, Ill let you know later! It seems to me that of the two most important elements of a story, plot and character, plot seems to be more masculine and character more feminine. That is to say, a story for men, if it skimps on either of the two, is more likely to skimp on character, while a story for women will short change the plot. The best stories, of course, are strong in both categories. Science fiction, being a more masculine genre  in fact the only genre of fiction whose readership is more male than female  has traditionally been solid on plot and hit or miss with the characters. There are exceptions, as one would expect, and Philip K. Dicks The Man in the High Castle, a Hugo Award winner, is one of these. The story takes place in what was the present day when the novel was written, 1962, but in an alternate timeline where Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan won World War II. The United States has been carved into puppet governments; Germany has sent astronauts to Mars, drained the Mediterranean for farmland and committed multiple genocides; Japan controls the west coast of North America, having become a cultural as well as political hegemony. It is a marvellous setting, both in conception and in description. Dicks prose makes it come alive with a few deft touches here and there, sparse but effective. Whereas in most stories the setting serves as a place for the plot to take place, the reader here gets the sense that the plot is just something to have happen in the setting. The world and its characters are the point; what they do in the narrative has less importance. This narrative, such as it is, consists of several story lines in the Pacific States of America and the Rocky Mountain States. Each storyline has a principle character connected in some way, often unbeknownst to him or her, with the others. The connections are frequently tenuous and the separate stories never get around to merging with, affecting, and reinforcing one another in a satisfying manner, but as separate, openended short stories they do work well. Dick has a knack for creating a compelling scene  composing with a patience, rhythm, sensitivity, and attention to detail one finds lacking in many storydriven works  and for putting interesting characters into them. Though in the big picture the story structure does not please as much as it might have, the various scenes along the way are of good quality, some of them superb. One that sticks out is a scene in which an antique shop owner, Robert Childan, has dinner at the house of a Japanese couple. The Japanese are a race that Childan views with disdain and admires, often simultaneously, and Dick takes us into Childans thoughts during the dinner as he moves from almost obsequious admiration to smug superiority. It all occurs in his head, set off by small cues and bits of conversation while the Japanese couple are merely having dinner, unaware of the turbulence in the thoughts and sentiments of their guest. It is perhaps the scene most emblematic of Dicks novel: almost everything of significance is about Childans character and happens in his head. The physical action is almost entirely trivial. The different tales in the novel range from the less consequential one of Frank Frink, who is merely trying to make it through life as a Jew in hiding, to the vital one of Mr. Baynes, who travels to meet with a key official in the Japanese government to warn him about a German plot. Then there is the story of Juliana Frink, exwife of Frank, whose story is less consequential in the grand scheme of things but which is probably the most significant one for the novel itself. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS There are two books that figure prominently in the novel. One is The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, an alternate history novel within this alternate history novel in which the Allies win World War II. The book has been outlawed in all Germaninfluenced territories but is nevertheless widely popular. The other is the I Ching, ubiquitous in the Pacific States and as if to prove my point about plot, the author used it to guide the tale, even reportedly expressing dissatisfaction at where it led him but staying faithful to what it told him. Unlike the separate threads of storyline, these two books do come together at the end to put the finishing touches on the recurring theme of perception, illusion, and reality. END OF SPOILERS The Man in the High Castle is not a long novel, and it feels like Part I of a larger, more epic work. Philip K. Dick himself intended to write a sequel to it, and indeed a couple of his later novels were conceived as sequels but did not turn out that way. The world Dick creates could certainly support a grander tale, and when it is finished one feels like there are many exciting things to come, if only Dick had written them. With another four hundred pages or so we might have been treated to an exhilarating mix of story lines, but then again, if the I Ching really was guiding the plot, we might have wound up nowhere at all. The characters consulting the I Ching are reflections of the author. It will surprise no libertarian to discover that this mystical author dealing with themes like the nature and reliability of reality would have some sort of basic leftist view. When he reads that FDR was assassinated, and that this was what prevented the US from getting out of the Great Depression and that for this reason the United States did not have the economic might to defeat Germany and Japan, he is likely to set the book down until he is done guffawing. Nevertheless, the book is a good one, better than most scifi novels I have read. The setting, the characters, the individual scenes  all of these contribute to the readers enjoyment. If the book seems under plotted, almost like it was headed in a definite direction but got aborted before it was fully formed, this gives the reader only a mild disappointment to be mixed with all the good feelings the story evoked. Perhaps if Dick had done something sensible like fashion the plot himself, a better story would have resulted. As it is, Im inclined to forgiveness based on the other merits; the flaws I shall blame on the I Ching.
Well damn, this was a really cute book. It follows a teen boy named Simon who is gay but hasnt come out yet, and he is emailing this anonymous person he calls Blue that is also a teen that goes to his school but is not okay with coming out yet. One day this kid named Martin finds all of Simons emails and blackmails him saying if Simon doesnt put in a good word for him with this girl he likes, then he will post screen caps of their emails on the schools tumblr page. I thought the premise of the book sounded intriguing and I got so much more from this book than what I was expecting. Not only is this book a light cute contemporary read about a boy discovering his sexuality, but Simon also has a lot to say about our society, and he makes some really good points. He constantly brings up the idea that everyone should come out because straight shouldnt be the default. And he doesnt understand why he even needs to come out in the first place and declare his sexuality because he doesnt understand why everyone just assumes youre straight. I never thought about it in this way and hes absolutely right. Its kind of messed up if you think about it. By assuming everyone is straight it makes it seem like its not normal or not okay to be anything but straight. I just love that Simon really makes a point of this during the story. White shouldnt be the default any more than straight should be the default. There shouldnt even be a default. Simon is a totally relatable character. Even though he has a close group of friends, he sometimes feels left out and sometimes his friends hang out without him and he feels hurt, and this is something I can totally relate to. I felt the same way in high school. Also, he struggles constantly with debating whether or not to come out to his parents and his friends and he doesnt want to make it a big deal but he thinks it is and it was just really fascinating to watch him grow and develop and learn more about himself. Even though I am straight, I found these moments with Simon to be so inspiring and encouraging. He talked about the ocean between people. And how the whole point of everything is to find a shore worth swimming to. I was trying to figure out who Blue was throughout the entire book and I was so wrong. I thought I knew for sure to. I had two different people I thought it was and it was neither of them, so props to the author for actually being able to surprise me because it doesnt happen often. I absolutely adored Simon and Blues emails back and forth. They just put a smile on my face every time I read them, and it was adorable. I love their thing with Oreos, its just so unique and I love when books include random cute things like that. Things like that are what make a book different from all the other books. I love watching Simon experience all these new things, like drinking his first beer and really falling in love for the first time. I also loved reading about Simons very strange family. The force him to watch The Bachelorette and then skype his sister whos away at college to discuss it with her; and I mean really discuss. Its hilarious. I also love how on Christmas they play Facebook Scavenger Hunting and they have to find a post related to: Someone visiting somewhere tropical, someone who just broke up, someone who posts song lyrics, etc. Its just so unique and hilarious and Ive never heard of anything like that before. That also has a lot to say about our society when you think about it. Our Facebook posts are so shallow and repetitive you can literally play a scavenger hunt game with them. Just another one of the many reasons I dont use Facebook. But Im tired of coming out. All I ever do is come out. I try not to change, but I keep changing, in all these tiny ways. I get a girlfriend. I have a beer. And every freaking time, I have to reintroduce myself to the universe all over again. Simon is also very sarcastic and its freaking hilarious to read about. Like this: I spend all Sunday in my room switching between the Smith and Kid Cudi at top volume, and I dont even care if its too random for my parents. Their minds can stay blown for all I care. Its little things like that that really made this book great for me. Its so funny and he shares the same sense of humor and use of sarcasm as I do. Its just wonderful. I think my favorite side character is Abby. She is so supportive of him and its really sweet and adorable. But I also did like Leah and Nick, even though at times their relationships got a little dramatic. I couldnt believe Martin and how he constantly threatened to blackmail him, it was ridiculous. He was such an asshole throughout most of the book. People really are like house with vast rooms and tiny windows. And maybe its a good thing, the way we never stop surprising each other. Overall, I really adored this story. Its just so cute and fluffy and everything you would expect it to be and more. Its mysterious as you try and figure out Blues true identity, and its adorable and rewarding when you do. I love the relationships he shares with his friends and his family. Its just a hella cute read.
Buddy Read with Charlie They took away her beautiful clothes, dressed her in an old gray smock, and gave her wooden shoes. I cannot even think of how I should begin this review... So let me try and use GIFs since I havent used GIFs in my reviews for a while. This book just really knocked it out of the park for me. And I have high hopes that the rest of the series will too. I havent been this excited about a book series since the Grisha Trilogy by Leigh Bardugo that I read last year. After reading the first paragraph from this book, I knew... I just knew it was going to be love. THE GIST Once upon a time, there was a cyborg girl who lived in New Beijing named Cinder. Half of her body is a machine and the other half remained human. I know you guys already know what a cyborg is but just thought Id say it anyways. So right now, she lives with her stepmother and two stepsisters. She doesnt really know who her real parents are. All she remember was that she was adopted to the family by her stepmothers husband who is now dead sadly. Her adoptive father has been nice to her, unfortunately, her stepmother was not. Legally, Cinder belonged to Adri as much as the household android and so too did her money, her few possessions, even the new foot shed just attached. Adri loved to remind her of that. Basically, she was treated like a maid just like in the original Cinderella story. Oooppss. I forgot, this is a retelling of Cinderellas story.. But you guys would have figured it out by now seeing her name and the stepmother and stepsisters scenario. Anyways, she works at the market as a mechanic, a good one at that. She is so good that the Prince of the Eastern Commonwealth visits her to ask if she could fix his android. She was met with startled copperbrown eyes and black hair that hung past his ears and lips that every girl in the country had admired a thousand times. Yes. The prince is indeed a pretty boy. Lol. But he is a pretty nice guy too. I think I should stop here because things might get pretty spoilery after this. But just when you think this is an ordinary retelling, you got it so wrong. THE PROTAGONISTS Cinder What? Really? And I thought I was just emotionally withdrawn. She pulled her feet up, hugging her knees. Im also incapable of blushing, if that was going to be your next brilliant observation. I love Cinder. I wasnt expecting to absolutely fall in love with her character but I did. She was sarcastic, brave, caring, responsible and everything i love in a character. She was also one that is flawed. She isnt a fucking Mary Sue! Thank you so fucking much! You dont see her as a special snowflake that would save the world. You will see her as this damaged girl literally and figuratively who just want to fit in. Who just want to be accepted for who she is. For some reason, cyborgs were abhored in this society. Im not sure if i missed the part where it was explained, but Im not sure why she should be bothered about being an cyborg. The things she could do is so awesome. Oh and by the way, she doesnt let those pesky teenage hormones rule over her decisions. This girl has a good head on her shoulders. One other thing too, Cinder does doubt herself sometimes, but then again, who doesnt? She gets insecure but being in her position it was quite understandable. Cinder is definitely one of the nicely written female character I have ever read. Prince Kai I think you should go to the ball with me. She clutched her fingers. His expression was too genuine, too sure. Her nerves tingled. Stars, she muttered. Didnt you already ask me that? Im hoping for a more favorable answer this time. And I seem to be getting more desperate by the minute. Prince Kai was charming. Honestly, I dont think this guy has any faults on him. He was such a sweet guy and loyal and responsible. We dont often see guys like him in books anymore. We almost always see the badboyturngoodguy type and sometimes I get sick of that. Kai was just so nice. And his struggles are very much shown too. His motivations and actions are well thought of. I liked that he wasnt put there just for the sake of having a romantic interest. THE ANTAGONISTS QUEEN LEVANA She was so good. I liked how intimating she was even when she wasnt saying anything yet. Although at this point in the series, I dont get why she was evil. But I do want to know and thats what made her an interesting character for me. ADRI LIHN Now we go to Cinders stepmother. She is so evil. I actually kind of hated her a bit more than Levana on this book because she has no heart. Im not saying that Levana has one, but on this book you get to see how she interacted with Cinder and how badly she treated her. I just wanted to strangle her all of the time she was in the book. THINGS I LIKED The world building was just amazing. I love her concept of New Beijing and the Eastern Commonwealth. I felt that it lacked a bit of describing of the environment but I just loved this world. How futuristic but current everything is. How people could be cyborgs and how people use androids which are basically Artificial Intelligence and also about the humans relationship with the people from the moon.. Yeah. There are people from the moon. The characters were so well written. Everyone is really fleshed out as if they were real human beings. You get to know them and their motivations and you understand them. I dont think there are characters here that were unnecessary to the story. All of them had their own roles to play and luckily, all of them did it wekl. Cinder as the protagonist is one of this books highlight. She is not what I was expecting. She wasnt a Mary Sue. She was bitter and hopeful at the same time. I just loved her. There was instalove but not really. And I actually found it really cute and sweet. I mean anyone would probably be in love with a prince right? Lol. I liked how the story progressed. It will keep you reading for more. I liked the pacing of this book. It was exactly how I wanted a fantasy book to be paced. I surprisingly liked that this was told in multiple, third person point of view. I usually prefer first person, but I liked that this book was in a different POV that I am used to. It has good villans. I think the main villain for the entire series is Queen Levana but Adri even if she was a smaller scale evil person is still a great addition to the evil people of this book. Marissa Meyers writing is so good. I am in love. THINGS I DIDNT LIKE I like being suprised by books. This book had so many foreshadowings that it was so easy for me to guess the plot twist in the book. And true enough, I was right. FINAL WORDS I cant recommend this book enough to people who like YA fantasy books. It is everything I wanted to see in a YA book. Theres a fantastic heroine, a goodhearted love interest, a scary villain, and a great world they belong in. Im currently reading Scarlet and so far it is as good as Cinder, although as a character, I still think Cinder is a better one. The second book actually introduces you to more characters to love and root for. Im not going to ask anymore because I know most of you have already read this book. What are youre thoughts about it? Did you like it, hate it, or arent sure? Leave some of your thoughts down below.
There is a special kind of emptiness in a marriage, when both the partners long for a child without success. Their private moments change from solitude to loneliness: intimate chatter degenerates into monosyllables before ultimately descending into dark silence. The carefree laughter of a child, the picture of a smiling cherubic face, or the pitterpatter of small feet on the road all become exquisite torture  reminders of some esoteric happiness forever out of reach. I know... I have been there. It must be at least in part to tackle this anxiety creatively that fairytales use the trope of the childless couple quite frequently. The story is quite formulaic: there will be an old couple mostly on the edge of a wood who would have been longing for a child without success for ages. Finally out of desperation, the woman or in some cases, both the partners together would fashion a childs likeness out of some unlikely object such as wood or mud, treat it like a human child for one night, and  hey presto!  it would become human overnight. The overjoyed couple would raise it as their own, but the story would usually end badly, with the breaking of some taboo resulting in the child going away. Snegurochka Snow Maiden is a Russian fairy tale where the child is fashioned out of snow by a childless woodcutter and his wife, and subsequently brought to life by Father Frost, the spirit of the winter, who takes pity on them. The snow maiden lives with her foster parents quite happily until she falls for a human boy against the express admonitions of Father Frost  the warmth inside melts her, and she fades away bringing spring to the countryside in the process. From myths.e2bn.org: As the snow maiden faded away, spring spread over the land: the frost retreated and the small flowers of the fields began to bloom. Everyone was cheered by the return of spring. Everyone that is except, the young shepherd who felt desolate and cold, despite the warmth of the sun. As for the old couple, they felt their loss deeply but, in their hearts, they had always known the magic could not last. They were just thankful for the beautiful snow maiden who had brought such warmth and joy to their lives and given them hope in the depths of winter. But what of the snow maiden? Well, it is said that, as she melted away, her spirit was caught by Father Frost who retreated to far lands with the advance of Mother Spring. He took the spirit of his daughter across the stars to the frozen lands of the north, where she again took the form of a beautiful young woman. Here she plays all through the summer  on the frozen seas. But, each year in winter, on the first day of the New Year, Father Frost and the Snow Maiden return to Russia in their troika sleigh. And they continue to work their magic, as they did long ago for the woodcutter and his wife, for those who are good and kind, particularly the children, bringing them small gifts and helping to make their dreams come true.  Eowyn Ivey has taken this bittersweet story, transplanted it to the rural Alaska of 1920s, and woven a tale which is every bit as magical as the original. Her protagonists are Mabel and Jack, who are trying to make a living on their farm, fighting against the unforgiving climate as well as life, which has given them only the memory of a stillborn child to live on. The couple are slowly moving apart, and Mabel is on the verge of suicide when, in one blustery night of mad gaiety they a fashion a girl out of snow in front of their cabin. Next day, the child is gone  and a wild girl starts visiting them, clandestinely at first, then more and more openly. The girl, Faina, is more or less adopted by the couple soon. Their close friends George and Esther initially consider the unseen girl as a hallucination conjured up by Mabel, but after the initial shock of meeting her in person, comes to accept her as she is. Their youngest son, Garrett, a boy of the forest himself is initially antagonistic. Well, as so often happens, antagonism changes to fascination, mutual attraction and love... and the story moves towards its expected climax and no, this is not a spoiler!. The beauty of this novel is that it does not follow the trope of the fairy tale blindly. Faina the child has a mysterious past as the daughter of an eccentric trapper who died in the forest. She lives off the wild, hunting and eating animals in a strangely feral manner. It is left to us to decide whether Faina is real or a phantasm. While such a style could easily become contrived, Ivey walks the tightrope expertly. There are times when we feel that the novelist is slipping into the realms of fantasy, but every time she pulls back just in time. Contrasted with Faina are Mabel and Jack, who are very real. Mabel, with her cultured upbringing and artistic tendencies, is the bridge that links the gritty and unromantic world of rural America to the poesy of the snowy slopes of the far north. In fact, the story is almost selfreferential in the sense that Mabel owns a book telling the story of the snow maiden, which her father a literature professor used to read to her: however, she learns as an adult that he only pretended to read, because the tale is in Russian! Only the pictures make sense, including the terrifying last one of the melted maiden. We follow the characters with bated breath as they move along their preordained paths  but the end, when it comes, is refreshingly different from yet absolutely faithful to the original. I will leave it at that.  From myths.e2bn.org: In countries that had long harsh winters, the coming of spring was also an immensely important event, particularly to the poor for whom the winters could be extremely harsh. The Russian story of the Snow Maiden sees the battle between the eternal forces of nature Father Frost and Mother Spring for warmth to return to the land. And for spring to return, winter has to die. The theme and the interaction of these mythical characters with mortal people like Kupava and Mizgir through the character of the Snow Maiden, would have been very meaningful to people, who longed for and celebrated the return of spring. Birth, death, rebirth  these are the themes of ageless tales. There are no full stops in life, but an endless cycle of seasons through which we eke out our existence  brief candles, whose flames are ephemeral yet eternal at some level. Four welldeserved stars.
For more book reviews, visit www.bookishfreaks.wordpress.com As someone who was not at all impressed by Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Mass, I was extremely reluctant to pick up this series, especially given the fact that it received the same amount of hype that Throne of Glass dida book I did not enjoy at all. For this reason, I had very low expectations when my best friend forced me to read ACOTAR you know you gotta read a book when your BFF says read this book or friendship over. And well...surprise, surprise, I once again have the unpopular opinion. The first thing that I want to mention is that this book is set in an incredibly beautiful world, and the way the writer portrayed this world and made this world come to life is beyond amazing. If you want to know what powerful world building is, then you should definitely read this book, if only to understand how it is done. World building is very important for any fantasy novel, but its rare for me to find a book where the writer so skillfully crafts the world that you can practically see this imaginary world right in front of you. Books transport you to different places, yes, but not all books can make you forget the reality you are living in the way A Court of Thorns and Roses can. And as someone who emphasizes a lot on world building in fantasy, the world of Prythian the land of the faeries is the only reason why I decided to finish this book and pick up the sequel. Note how I stressed that the world building is the only reason why I am continuing with the series. Now this is where I start ranting about all the things that I hated about this book. Lets start with what pissed me off the most: our supposedly badass, strong, female protagonist, Feyre. Feyre suffers from what I am starting to call The Strong Female Syndrome. She has excellent surviving skills, she can fight like its no ones business, she is funny, she is witty, she is observant, she looks after her family and is protective of them and would give up anything for them. She is also neglected and to an extent, emotionally abused by said family. But none of these things make me hate her. In fact, these are things that should have made me admire her, except for the fact that she is stereotyped as many strong females are these days by a few notsoadmirable things, the first of many, is her hypocrisy. In the very beginning of the book, we see her resenting her eldest sister Nesta, for not caring about their crippled father. In the very next paragraph, we see her, Feyre, resenting her own crippled and traumatized father for not trying whatever he could do to look after them, to feed them or care for them. Now, I understand that someone who was forced to do dangerous, bone breaking tasks at the age of fourteen does have the right to be resentful about her situation and may even place blame on those who do not deserve it it is not right, but it is understandable. But thats not what I am pointing out here. I am pointing out the double standard when she accuses Nesta of being hearltess for hating their father for not looking after them, when Feyre herself does the same. And we see this hypocrisy several times in different circumstances throughout the book with different characters and different situations. I wont include the examples in this review because this review is already nearly 1000 words, so instead them Ill talk more about them in details in this Saturdays Stray Thoughts post a bi weekly discussion post feature, but bottom line is: I understand the need to make characters have one or more flaws, but these days majority of strong female leads have the exact same commendable qualities silver tongue, sarcastic, great at combat and the exact same imperfections ill tempered, full of vitriol, punches first and asks questions later. Its becoming a stereotype that needs to be broken, because people are multifaceted. You do not have to fit yourself into a certain type of mold to be considered strong. Now lets move on to our supposedly ohsoswoonworthy love interest Tamlin. Majority of the readers who are done with the second book detest him, while those still reading the first book adore him and practically squeal whenever Chapter 27 comes up in coversation, but to be perfectly honest, while I didnt hate Tamlin, his relationship with Feyre made me extremely uncomfortable. While I cant say I noticed any abuse, his dominating behavior towards Feyre, coupled with the fact that Feyre was his prisoner and completely at his mercy, raised many red flags in my mind when they began their relationship. I couldnt help but feel as though it was more Stockholm Syndrome than actual love, especially because there wasnt any reason behind them falling in love, and that made me especially uncomfortable during some of the more intimate scenes between them. And while I have no problem seeing Stockholm Syndrome in a book, I do believe it is something that should be acknowledged as opposed to being treated as a normal love story. Other than Feyre being annoying and the relationship in the book being problematic, there were many things in this book that I truly loved. The supporting characters, the cultures and customs of the Fae, the world of Prythian and ofcourseour evil, hateful villainall of them made reading this book fairly enjoyable but only after reaching the 70 mark. The final showdown between Feyre and the antagonist remains my favorite scene throughout the entire book and it almost made up for all the other things that this book lacked. To put it simply: A Court of Thorns and Roses is a book worth giving a try, and I am definitely going to continue with the series because I am very intrigued by the plot and I want to see where Mass goes with it, but its really not worthy of all the hype it has received.
