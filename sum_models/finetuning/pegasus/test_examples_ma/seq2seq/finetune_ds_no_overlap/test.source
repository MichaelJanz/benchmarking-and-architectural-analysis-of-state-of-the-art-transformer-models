This is a collection of 9 short stories set in the world of the Lunar Chronicles. In this collection, the reader gets to discover how Wolf became the solider he is, a young Carswell Thorne, how Cress ended up on the satellite, how Cinder arrived in New Beijing, Cinder and Kais first meeting from his perspective, how Scarlet came to the farm, a wedding, and more. They are arranged in chronological order. Story: The Keeper Michelle Benoit, Scarlets grandmother, finds herself the guardian of a young lunar girl. This girl is important, but she must be kept hidden. Then her young granddaughter Scarlet arrives. Michelle knows that she will protect both Scarlet and the young girl at all costs. But what will it be? My Thoughts: This is actually a prequel to Scarlet. Time passes rather quickly in this story. Since I have never read the prequel story before, I really enjoyed this one. I loved getting more of Scarlets background and seeing how Cinder received her cyborg parts. Rating: 4.5 stars Story: Glitches Cinder has arrived in New Beijing and now meets her new family. Cinder soon finds herself at odds with her new family, and then tragedy strikes when Linh Garan is stricken with the plague. My Thoughts: Cinders book is a retelling of Cinderella. This is a prequel story for it. It explains how the stepmother is left raising the girls. This glimpse into the eleven year old Cinder is both touching and rather sad. Touching because I know what she will become. Sad because of how shes treated. Rating: 4 stars Story: The Queens Army Zeev Kesley is only 12 years old when he is chosen to become a part of the army that the queen is building. Hes ripped away from his family and given injections that change him. Hes forced to prove himself over and over. My Thoughts: Wolf has been my favorite character since he first appeared. But this backstory of his shows just how cruel Levanna was. My heart hurt for the boy that was Zeev. But this story made me love him more. Rating: 5 stars Story: Carswells Guide to Being Lucky Carswell Thorne is young. Very young. And hes already proven himself to be adept at getting what he wants. But is he really just trying to gain the attention of his parents? My Thoughts: This one was rather humorous for me. I enjoyed getting to see the young Thorne. And to see, in part, how he became the man that falls for Cress. Cute. Definitely lighthearted, especially after reading Wolfs backstory. Rating: 4 stars Story:After Sunshine Passes By Crescent Moon is a shell. But shes very talented at anything related to a computer. She hopes to be of use to the queen, but doesnt like Sybil Mira. When Sybil realizes exactly how skilled Cress is at computer programming, she takes Cress to an isolated satellite. There Cress is left on her own. My Thoughts: This was probably the shortest of all of the stories. And once again, it just shows how far those who work for the queen will go to ensure that the queen remains queen. But, at least this story explained how Cress came to the satellite. Rating: 5 stars Story: The Princess and the Guard Princess Winter is used to playing with the son of one of the palace guards. Jacin is Winters best friend. But hes so much more than that. Hes her protector. Sure, hes got his own dreams of being a doctor, but Princess Winter is more important. As Winter grows, she realizes what using her Lunar gift does, and wants nothing to do with it. Will Jacin stay beside her? My Thoughts: While this couple is not my favorite, I have to admit that this story made me understand their relationship so much more. My heart broke for Winter as she realized the end result of not using her gift. But I actually came to really like Jacin for the way he stay with her. Rating: 4.5 stars Story: The Little Android Mech 6.0 is a mechanic working on a luxury ship. When the owners son falls into a vat of oil, she dives in after him  at the expense of her own functionality. A new body later, Mec 6.0 is watching from a distance as the young man falls in love with the clients daughter. Yet he doesnt know how she feels. My Thoughts: I loved this story. Its a retelling of the Little Mermaid, and is just beautiful. This is the only story that doesnt really feature any of the main characters. Ive read the Han Christian Anderson fairy tale and it is heart breaking. This one had me in tears. Meyer stays true to the Anderson story and not the Disney version. Rating: 5 stars Story: The Mechanic Prince Kaito has a problem. His trusted android, Nanci, isnt working. He needs her. Because she has information about the missing princess Selene. Kai has heard of a mechanic name Linh Cinder who has a reputation of being able to fix just about anything, so since hes desperate, he leaves the palace and heads to the New Beijing market. He doesnt expect to discover that Linh Cinder is a cute teenage girl close to his age. He also doesnt realize how important that this mechanic is going to be in his own life. My Thoughts: I loved seeing this from Kais perspective. Because at first, I didnt like the dynamic between Kai and Cinder. It grew on me through the series, but I didnt like it at first. This though, showed that he liked her from the beginning. Of course, it gives glimpses of what theyre going to mean to each other later on, but this first meeting, from his perspective was so sweet. It was like one of those awww moments. Rating: 5 stars Story: Something Old, Something New This is the wedding of the century. Cinder, Iko, Cress, and Thorne arrive at Scarlets farm where they meet up with Kai, Winter, and Jacin. There has been a wedding being planned, but which couple will be the one to get married? And will everything go off without a hitch considering that in attendance there will be an emperor, a princess, a queen, and more than a few Lunars? My Thoughts: This is the story that I was by far the most excited about. It is the reason that I bought the book. I have to say, that this is the perfect conclusion to the series. The wedding was obviously going to be one of the four couples, but which one? I knew which couple I was wanting, but Id have been happy with any of them. This story is set 2 years after Winter. And I have to say, that I LOVED it! Im trying really hard to be spoiler free here, so I can only gush about how delightfully cute it is. Rating: 5 stars Overall thoughts: This is the perfect companion to the Lunar Chronicles. More so in my opinion than Fairest. While some of the stories were better than others, all were good. I read this book for pure pleasure. Overall rating: 4.67 stars, rounded up to 5 stars.
I received a copy in exchange for an honest review After reading some mixed reviews I wasnt sure whether I wanted to read this series, although I liked the cover and the concept and when i saw the book on netgalley I decided to give it a chance and see for myself what it was all about. I have to say I am glad I did as I really enjoyed The Selection. The Selection is a fun and enjoyable book and I just wanted to keep reading. I have to admit it was an addictive book and really enjoyed it. The Selection is about main character America Singer, she lives in a dystopia future country where the prince chooses his bride through a selection. Every girl in the country is eligible and can submit themselves and then 35 girls are chosen to live in the palace and the prince chooses his bride from among those. Its almost a fairytale story with how a poor girl gets the chance to become a princes. The plot might sounds a bit ridiculous but it was just so much fun to read about these 35 girls who all wanted the price andor the crown and al the dynamics surrounding this. I had some expectations about this book and the characters that where quickly proven wrong. Like how the girls werent only there for the competition and some made friends. How America wasnt there for the prince at all, but for her family. And how the prince wasnt a stuck up rich guy, but someone who genuinely cared and for whom the selection was as hard as for the girl themselves. So yes the main characters really is named America Singer, she is named after America and she does sing. I seriously had expected that her name would bother me lot, but as its told from first person perspective her name isnt used that much. And there is even a story reason behind her name, beside the obvious. So the name didnt really bother me as much when I was reading. America is a great main character, she loves Aspen and isnt interested in the Selection, she doesnt want to marry the prince, but eventually Aspen and her family convince her to signup and guess what she gets chosen. I liked how downtoearth she was, she spoke her mind to the prince without being afraid of the consequences. She made friends with her maids and often preferred their company to the rest of the girls. She was nice to the other girls and didnt feel entitles to anything as she knows what is to be poor and have hunger. It was refreshing. The side characters are nice, but its hard to really get to know any of the side characters as there are just so many of them, I am hoping that will be less of an issue in the next book as only 6 girls remain then. We do get to know Maxon who seems like a nice guy and wasnt the stuckup prince I expected, he was nice, even a bit shy and he was pretty open and honest with America which is the thing I liked most about their relationship. I also liked May, Americas younger sister, as she was just a fun and enthusiastic character. The Romance was nicely done, while America loves Aspen that only plays a small part, some sad things happen between them, but it was obvious they cared for each other. It was harder for me to feel their romance though as we dont really get their history they are already in love when the book start and while it was written well I still felt like we missed a piece. Then there is Maxon, America doesnt expect to fall in love with him, but she is nice to him and they become friends and it slowly grows into more. It was nice to see and I liked how open America was to Maxon, especially at first, later that does change a bit. So yeah there was a love triangle, but it was done pretty well in my opinion. Both love interest have a different connection and past and even though I am pretty sure I know who she ends up with I am curious how she will end up there. The world building is one of the few disappointing facts, but as I has expected this form previous reviews it didnt bother me too much. Dont read the Selection hoping for an intriguing dystopia world yes there are dystopia elements, but it really isnt the focus. I was okay with the world building not being the focus, but in my opinion they better couldve scrapped it at all and just focussed on the competition. the only piece of world building that really plays a role was the caste system. Then there are the rebel attacks, but it all felt a bit off. There are multiple rebel attacks and its supposed to be scary, but it was hard to care as we knew so little of the rebels and they never did anything. So yeah the world building was really weak and only the caste system played any role. To conclude: this was a fun and enjoyable book and I just wanted to keep reading as I was really enjoying this book. The story is fun to read about with the girls competing for the prince his love. The characters are likeable and I especially liked America and how down to earth she was, she was just a genuinely nice person. I was also surprised by the prince and how he was actually a nice person. The romance is done well, there is a bit of a love triangle although I felt more of the romance between America and prince Maxon as we see that one building from the beginning. There isnt much world building and I think they couldve just skipped the whole attempt to make this a dystopia beside the caste system. I enjoyed the book and didnt mind that there wasnt much world building as it isnt about that and it doesnt detract from my enjoyment that we know little about the world. All in all an enjoyable book and I am looking forward to the rest of the books in the series.
In Firespell, Chloe Neill expands on her take of underworld, paranormal Chicago see the Chicagoland Vampires series. This time, Neill takes a foray into YA with the first book of her Dark Elite series, set in a Chicago boarding school where all is not as it seems. Of course. Lily Parker is ready to start her junior year of high school in Sagamore, New York, when her parents inform her that they are going on a research sabbatical in Germany for two years  and sending her to an elite boarding school in Chicago for the remainder of high school. Lily is packed off and installed at St. Sophias School for Girls, in a new big city where she doesnt know a soul. That is, until she meets Scout Green, her slightly odd suitemate, who is prone to sneaking off in the night and seems to be harboring a secret. A secret that has to do with whatevers in the basement of the school. A secret that is dangerous, maybe even deadly. A secret that suddenly seems to include Lily herself, in ways she never could have imagined. What can I say about Firespell? Its not something that hasnt been done before; there are plenty of boarding school stories out there, and a good chunk of those stories have a magical slant with a new kid who finds herself in the middle of some magical feud, or the target of powerful mean girls, etc., etc., only to discover that she plays a bigger part in the battle than she thought. Its been done. And it will continue to be done, because for some unknown reason, we all seem enthralled by the idea, myself included. I mean, hell, I read all of the Gemma Doyle series, even though its icky long and I didnt like it from page one. Firespell may not have been anything unusual, but it was certainly fun. Lily was a fine lead, but her friend and suitemate, Scout, stole the show. Scout was fun and quirky, and yes, I may be a little biased because her dorm room is overflowing with books which are organized by color. If youve ever been in my room you havent, and you never will, you would know that this makes her a girl after my own . There was a bit of a mystery to the mystery. You know what I mean, right? You know somethings coming, and you think youve got it pegged down, but there is a little doubt in your head. It was like that. It didnt go quite where I expected it. And Neill gave herself plenty of room to grow in the series. We get hints of other characters, but she judiciously avoided giving everything away in book one, so well get to explore them further as the series goes on, which is a good thing. A couple of them are swoonworthy boys, if youre into that kind of thing. You know you are; stop blushing. There were some drawbacks, of course, aside from the somewhat cookiecutter, slightly melodramatic plot, and these things were just sort of petpeevish for me. Those of you familiar with Neills adult Chicagoland Vampires series will know that theres a very collegiate, sororityfraternity feel to it, with the different vampire sects being divided into houses think grown up Gryffindor, with house colors and coats of arms, and such. Firespell has a very similar feel, which is to be expected, as it is set in a school. I didnt have a problem with that, as such, though it makes me wonder if shes limited in her scope. What did bother me was the classification of the different magical beings in the book as JV and Varsity  and then the continual repetition of these terms. Now, its one thing to make an offhanded reference, but it just seems a little silly and thin when it becomes an actual element in the story. Im not sure how to explain this without giving something away, but I just felt it was weak, and more so, irritating. Along the same lines, Neill seems to get stuck in these random patterns of weird word repetition, and it throws off the story. Now, this isnt a huge issue, and some people wont even notice it, but its a pet peeve of mine because I believe that authors have a responsibility to put such insane amounts of thought into their work that they eliminate these little nuisances that break the reader out of the flow of the story. And after being a writing tutor for 5 years, these things jump out at me, and I can just feel them there, lurking, trying to drive me insane. Im just saying. Perhaps my biggest pet peeve, though, is that Neill tries too hard at witty banter. She is funny, and when it works, it works. But she forces it too often, and sometimes, whether its funny or not, it just makes the dialogue seem fake and the characters less believable. She needs to trust herself more to carry the story without one liners. Or to learn that not every person in this world is the oneliner type, so not every character should be, either. With a little more attention to natural sounding dialogue and character thoughts, I wouldnt have that much to complain about in Neills writing. None of these drawbacks, however, would keep me from recommending this book. They arent constant, they just crop up occasionally throughout, and they dont outweigh the book as a fun, fast, light read. So yes, Firespell has been done before. And its fairly easy to see where its going; nothing ever really came as a shock, and I doubt anything will as the series goes on. It may lean suspiciously towards the melodramatic, and it may have its flaws in the style of the writing. That being said, its still a fun read, and if you have to read one boarding school, supernatural story, why not make it this one? ps. I adore the cover.
I just read this, July 2015, but wrote this review a couple years ago, and pretty much hold to my views then, in spite of the fact that after first reading this book and loving it, I read each of his previous books and liked them less and less. I basically think he is a pretty good technical writer, smart, loves language, but until this book did not find an important subject to write about. Before this book he was mostly just clever without a real important purpose. His characters all sound like Green himself, smart, literary, and sarcastic, though he can be touching, too. Gus and Hazel sound alike, but they still seem compelling to me. They are smarter than teenagers typically are, by far, prep school kids, but I like what they have to say still. Another thing: I think Greens main influence in his writing of this story is Peter DeVriess masterpiece about pediatric cancer, The Blood of the Lamb, which is better than Fault, but has that same mashup of bitterness and sardonic humor and vulnerability. I highly recommend that one, too. This is the October 29, 2012 review: How do you write a book about kids with cancer and not fall into certain traps? For instance, how do you avoid sentimentality, being maudlin, being inspirational, etc? Of course, most people LOVE these aspects of books about stories of death, they like to weep, they need hope, etc. I dont want to dismiss those human tendencies, of course. And for some, the sappier the better! But what if you gag on that sickly sweet sap? A host of books attempt to answer this question from a more literary and philosophical point of view, and a problem not easily solved. Dave Eggers took on the problem in his memoir, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, about the sudden and completely outoftheblue deaths from cancer of his two parents, that left him, a college student, to raise his younger brother alone. Do you cry? Sure, but in the process he grapples seriously with the issue of how to tell the tale without becoming the hero he does not feel he really is. How do you avoid this? Well, he goes meta on us, he talks about the issue with us frankly, and he undermines his own potential heroism so courageous! How could he possibly live with so much grief and responsibility at such a young age?!! by making himself out to also be a selfish jerk at times, bitter, clueless. He laughs at himself, he gets angry at himself and the world, and everything. Greg Michies story of his urban teaching, Holler if You Hear Me, works in a similar way to show us how he fails all the time as a teacher... which ironically for both Michie and Eggers actually increases our sympathy for them as heroes....they GET points for being courageous by undermining this very claim about fearful and uncourageous they really are! But I like the move, and their honesty and UNsentimentality increases their credibility. Green is an often very very good writer, who takes on Eggerss charge to try at all costs to avoid sentimentality, in the service of TRUE sentiment, to get at the core of the really important emotions and ideas working this enterprise we all have to face and face again and again in various ways: death. How does he pull it off? With many strategies; one is wit which is also the title of a one woman play about a woman with cancer, where the choice of to laugh or to cry is an easy one for Green. He does rage as his characters rage, but he is inclined to find a way to laugh when he can, and the darker the joke, the better, though these jokes also sometimes set up tender scenes, too. He creates teen and adult characters who are so smart and so witty and so cynical and so deeply insightful that the sap dries up almost everywhere well, not everywhere, but give him a break, the death from cancer of teens is a tough challenge for even a cynical writer and he is not that cynical, finally. There are other books like this: Cancer Vixen, Cancer Made Me Shallower, others... I heard a comic with cancer talking on NPR about how she did standup the night she had gotten a diagnosis that her cancer had returned... tough, and funny. And the mainstream stories are really about faith, about not giving up, about courage, and while all cancer books do deal with these issues in one way or the other, most of Greens characters are agnostic, existentialist, sometimes but rarely bitter, and usually accepting of death as just part of life. They hate the idea of being inspired by their cancer. They hate cancer perks and false hopes. One central and dearly lovable character, Augustus, does seem to believe in Something, and hopes to come back to visit his funeral, but Green is not taking a position on that, he is himself smartassedly existentialist, though not a grim one; he admires his kid characters for their commitment to just going on. As Beckett says it, through I think Molloy: I cant go on, Ill go on. Maybe some folks wont like Green as much as Beckett, and I dont, but they have similar purposes: How to face oblivion and the short time we have on the planet usefully. So yes, spoiler alert, people do die in this book, and you do cry, and yes, you admire the courage and wit and smart assed humor and insight of him and his characters, but you also admire Green himself for writing so beautifully. He really is a good writer, and he supports great human beings over terrible ones. This is YA at its very best, and deserves all the accolades it can get, in my opinion. As he has Augustus, one of the central characters say, The real heroes arent the people doing things, they real heroes are the people NOTICING things, the ones paying attention. Hes talking about Hazel Grace, our main character, but hes also talking about writers, artists, human beings at their best. Here is Green talking in a meta way to other writers what writing can and must do. I cried reading this book, but sometimes it was just because his writing was so deft, so wonderful, it occasionally took my breath away. That last book that did for me for me to cry about great writing was also YA, Okay for Now, by Gary Schmidt, which also very much endorses the importance of art in teen and generally, human identity and sensemaking. I think Schmidts book is better, actually, more affecting, even, but I still like Green in this book. One thing Hazel Grace, the agnostic, says, hanging in a park with her family, reconsidering Augustuss possible view of faith against a favorite writer Peter VanHoutens cynical despair: Who am I to say that these things might not be forever? Who is Peter VanHouten to assert as fact the conjecture that our labor is temporary? All I know of heaven and all I know of earth is in this park: an elegant universe in ceaseless motion, teeming with ruined ruins and screaming children. Green throughout the book also uses the playing of video games one kind of storytelling to mirror his view of what uses fiction and storytelling can contribute to a good life: paying attention. I cried when Hazel Grace recited poetry to Augustus, even the spare William Carlos Williamss The Red Wheelbarrow: so much dependsupona red wheelbarrowglazed with rainwaterbeside the whitechickens. You are only on the planet so long; pay attention, pay attention, take care of each other.

But she wasnt sure that moving forward with him was something she wanted either. After everything theyd gone through together, she just wanted a chance at normal for awhile.

Even with the knowledge that being with Daemon put her and everyone she knew in danger. And even though the possibility of a happily ever after for them was more dream than reality.

Armentrout has delivered yet another spellbinding book in this series. Her lovable heroine Katy and the easy flow to her writing will keep readers coming back for more. Her at times antagonistic protagonist Daemon will keep readers transfixed. And her intriguing and nailbiting plot infused with humor, sarcasm, fiery personalities and smoldering chemistry will leave readers anxious for Opal, the next book in the series. Onyx is an absolute must for anyone who enjoyed Obsidian, for readers who love an easy to devour book with characters theyll want to connect to and for fans of paranormalscifi books with a bit of a mystery, a whole lot of action and an electricallycharged love story. On a personal note: I completely and totally inhaled this book. Once I finally had a second to pick it up that is. And once I did I could not put it down. Yes it was unputdownable. Well, until just before the end when I didnt want to keep reading because I didnt want it to end. Onyx had all the heat and chemistry that Obsidian had. But it had so much more  more danger, more sizzle, more heartbreak, more angst, more danger...did I say that already? Thats okay. It deserves to be mentioned twice. The threats in this book were way more deadly than those in that first book. And there was more story development in this sequel. The plot progressed quite a bit actually. We got to learn so much more about this world the author created. And as far as character development? Oh there was a whole lot of that. Lets just say that we got a much closer and longer look at Daemon. Yes, Daemon, who finally became more than the hot, sexy jerk he was in that first book. Though he was every bit as hot, every bit the tease, and every bit the tormenter of Katy, he showed us that isnt all he is. There is more to him. And he has much more to offer. Katy drove me a little batty in this book because she was so stubborn when it came to Daemon and so secretive when she could have been so much more open. What about? Well, that I cant say without being seriously spoilery. But she had a few chances to open up and chose to remain silent. And lets just say there were consequences for those actions. Big ones. But Katy also was seriously awesome in this book. She did things.... Well I cant say exactly what things she did or that would be spoilery too, but she did do some things that I never thought possible. Not by her. And by the end of this book she was definitely a different Katy than she was at the start of it. As if it wasnt enough that this book was filled with action, and packed full of Daemon and Katy moments, there were some other moments that made my breath catch, made me bite my nails and made me wish and hope and plead for certain outcomes. And some that made me desperately wish they wouldnt ever come true. I did get all twisty inside from this one particular scene and maybe another one. And very possibly a third. I actually couldnt believe just how much happened in this book. The story was packed so full and yet I kept wanting more. At the end I just wanted to keep reading even though there was no story left to read. Onyx made me want to go back and reread Obsidian the second I finished it. I wanted to compare the Daemon in that book with the Daemon in this one and I wanted to do the same for Katy. I loved this new side of Daemon that we got to see. I loved learning more about the Luxen. And I both loved and hated the new character that made an appearance in this book and in Katys life. I cant wait to find out what happens in Opal. I am dying to learn what the meaning behind that particular title is. I am even more nervous about whats going on with the DOD and incredibly anxious about some of the dangers that have arisen. I am so worried that things are not going to end well. And Im terrified about just how other things will progress. Especially after what happened at the end. While not totally unexpected, as the author built it up so perfectly, there are so many different directions the story can take. Most of which have the potential to be utterly heartbreaking. And where things can go very, very wrong. Fast. I just know the wait for Opal will be so unbelievably tortuous. Its only been a short time since I finished Onyx and Im already going crazy. So a reread of both books may be in order, because release date for the third book in the series is a long, long ways away.
This book was AMAZING!!! I have a soft spot for anything involving postapocalyptic worlds and this one blew me away. I read this book so fast and had a hard time putting it down. This book had everything that makes a book great: action, fastpaced, great characters, amazing writing, intricate plot, and a swoon worthy romance or at least I thought it was. I loved the writing in this book. I thought the duel points of view was written so well, some of the best that I have ever read. Usually authors seems to struggle with creating distinct voices for their characters when they write in duel points of views, but Yancey was able to change his writing style so that all the characters voices were unique and easily able to distinguish from one another. I loved reading Cassies point of view because her inner and outer dialogue was very snarky and funny, but not in an annoying way. I loved hearing about the alien invasion from her point of view and her sections were my favorite parts in the book. I also really liked Bens AKA Zombies point of view as well. I feel like the majority of the parts in the book that Ben was in were heartpounding and action packed. I also like that Yancey included small sections of other peoples points of view to give readers insight into what was happening in other parts of the book. I absolutely loved the plot of this book. Although there are other books focusing on alien invasions, this one did it in a completely unique way. The different waves that were wiping out human existence was such a good idea and I was always on the edge of my seat to see what would be the next wave of attack. I also liked that this book was realistic in that when the aliens invaded, teenagers remained teenagers. They did not all of a sudden know how to fight a war, cure diseases, and turn into soldiers. Most of the characters in this book survived from pure luck. The characters also did not make horrible, rash decisions that were highly unlikely to succeed....well mostly. I also liked the psychological aspect of this book. Yancey really pegged society well and was able to create a population that adhered to decisions that would likely be made if an alien invasion or other big catastrophe had happened. I fell in love with the characters in this book and there were not any characters that I disliked, except the ones that you are suppose to. I really was rooting for all of these characters to succeed and continue living. I felt a really strong connection to Cassie because of her background and how much she had to fight to survive. I think it was learning about Cassies past that really made me like her a little more than Ben. Readers get a slight looking into Bens past, and although it is just as sad a Cassies, we dont get the indepth look at his family dynamic or the pain he went through. I really liked Cassies little brother, which surprised me because usually young children in postapocalyptic books become really annoying. I also liked Ringer because it was nice to see that Yancey included several kickass girls in his book. I am really glad that she will be more of a central character in the second book. This book defiantly made me have all of the feels. Within the first 100 pages, I had laughed and got teary eyed. I felt so sad for Cassie, Ben, and all the other characters in this book because of the loss that so many of them had felt. I thought Yancey was really good at making readers feel the loss, panic, and hopelessness that the characters were feeling in this book. My adrenaline was constantly running on high while reading this book since it was full of really intense moments. I was shocked several times while reading this book because there were so many twists that I did not see coming. I really enjoyed the ending of this book, which left off on a huge cliffhanger. The one thing that I was not expecting in this book was the romance. I was surprised at how much I was invested in the relationship Cassie had with another character in this book. I was rooting for them even though the odds are completely against them in every way possible. I kind of feel like there is a possibility for a love triangle in the second book in this series, but I am thinking Yancey will not take that route or at least I am hoping. I usually like love triangles, but I am so invested in the relationship between Cassie and the other character I dont want to give away spoilers that I do not want to see anything get in the way of it. Overall, this book was fantastic. I will defiantly be continuing on with the series and am so happy that this book is being made into a movie. I think this book is going to translate into film perfectly and I know this is one book to movie adaptation that my husband will not be complaining about taking me to. I do recommend this to anyone who likes postapocalyptic books, but be warned, this book is pretty depressing at times and does cover some mature themes.
Buddy Read with Charlie They took away her beautiful clothes, dressed her in an old gray smock, and gave her wooden shoes. I cannot even think of how I should begin this review... So let me try and use GIFs since I havent used GIFs in my reviews for a while. This book just really knocked it out of the park for me. And I have high hopes that the rest of the series will too. I havent been this excited about a book series since the Grisha Trilogy by Leigh Bardugo that I read last year. After reading the first paragraph from this book, I knew... I just knew it was going to be love. THE GIST Once upon a time, there was a cyborg girl who lived in New Beijing named Cinder. Half of her body is a machine and the other half remained human. I know you guys already know what a cyborg is but just thought Id say it anyways. So right now, she lives with her stepmother and two stepsisters. She doesnt really know who her real parents are. All she remember was that she was adopted to the family by her stepmothers husband who is now dead sadly. Her adoptive father has been nice to her, unfortunately, her stepmother was not. Legally, Cinder belonged to Adri as much as the household android and so too did her money, her few possessions, even the new foot shed just attached. Adri loved to remind her of that. Basically, she was treated like a maid just like in the original Cinderella story. Oooppss. I forgot, this is a retelling of Cinderellas story.. But you guys would have figured it out by now seeing her name and the stepmother and stepsisters scenario. Anyways, she works at the market as a mechanic, a good one at that. She is so good that the Prince of the Eastern Commonwealth visits her to ask if she could fix his android. She was met with startled copperbrown eyes and black hair that hung past his ears and lips that every girl in the country had admired a thousand times. Yes. The prince is indeed a pretty boy. Lol. But he is a pretty nice guy too. I think I should stop here because things might get pretty spoilery after this. But just when you think this is an ordinary retelling, you got it so wrong. THE PROTAGONISTS Cinder What? Really? And I thought I was just emotionally withdrawn. She pulled her feet up, hugging her knees. Im also incapable of blushing, if that was going to be your next brilliant observation. I love Cinder. I wasnt expecting to absolutely fall in love with her character but I did. She was sarcastic, brave, caring, responsible and everything i love in a character. She was also one that is flawed. She isnt a fucking Mary Sue! Thank you so fucking much! You dont see her as a special snowflake that would save the world. You will see her as this damaged girl literally and figuratively who just want to fit in. Who just want to be accepted for who she is. For some reason, cyborgs were abhored in this society. Im not sure if i missed the part where it was explained, but Im not sure why she should be bothered about being an cyborg. The things she could do is so awesome. Oh and by the way, she doesnt let those pesky teenage hormones rule over her decisions. This girl has a good head on her shoulders. One other thing too, Cinder does doubt herself sometimes, but then again, who doesnt? She gets insecure but being in her position it was quite understandable. Cinder is definitely one of the nicely written female character I have ever read. Prince Kai I think you should go to the ball with me. She clutched her fingers. His expression was too genuine, too sure. Her nerves tingled. Stars, she muttered. Didnt you already ask me that? Im hoping for a more favorable answer this time. And I seem to be getting more desperate by the minute. Prince Kai was charming. Honestly, I dont think this guy has any faults on him. He was such a sweet guy and loyal and responsible. We dont often see guys like him in books anymore. We almost always see the badboyturngoodguy type and sometimes I get sick of that. Kai was just so nice. And his struggles are very much shown too. His motivations and actions are well thought of. I liked that he wasnt put there just for the sake of having a romantic interest. THE ANTAGONISTS QUEEN LEVANA She was so good. I liked how intimating she was even when she wasnt saying anything yet. Although at this point in the series, I dont get why she was evil. But I do want to know and thats what made her an interesting character for me. ADRI LIHN Now we go to Cinders stepmother. She is so evil. I actually kind of hated her a bit more than Levana on this book because she has no heart. Im not saying that Levana has one, but on this book you get to see how she interacted with Cinder and how badly she treated her. I just wanted to strangle her all of the time she was in the book. THINGS I LIKED The world building was just amazing. I love her concept of New Beijing and the Eastern Commonwealth. I felt that it lacked a bit of describing of the environment but I just loved this world. How futuristic but current everything is. How people could be cyborgs and how people use androids which are basically Artificial Intelligence and also about the humans relationship with the people from the moon.. Yeah. There are people from the moon. The characters were so well written. Everyone is really fleshed out as if they were real human beings. You get to know them and their motivations and you understand them. I dont think there are characters here that were unnecessary to the story. All of them had their own roles to play and luckily, all of them did it wekl. Cinder as the protagonist is one of this books highlight. She is not what I was expecting. She wasnt a Mary Sue. She was bitter and hopeful at the same time. I just loved her. There was instalove but not really. And I actually found it really cute and sweet. I mean anyone would probably be in love with a prince right? Lol. I liked how the story progressed. It will keep you reading for more. I liked the pacing of this book. It was exactly how I wanted a fantasy book to be paced. I surprisingly liked that this was told in multiple, third person point of view. I usually prefer first person, but I liked that this book was in a different POV that I am used to. It has good villans. I think the main villain for the entire series is Queen Levana but Adri even if she was a smaller scale evil person is still a great addition to the evil people of this book. Marissa Meyers writing is so good. I am in love. THINGS I DIDNT LIKE I like being suprised by books. This book had so many foreshadowings that it was so easy for me to guess the plot twist in the book. And true enough, I was right. FINAL WORDS I cant recommend this book enough to people who like YA fantasy books. It is everything I wanted to see in a YA book. Theres a fantastic heroine, a goodhearted love interest, a scary villain, and a great world they belong in. Im currently reading Scarlet and so far it is as good as Cinder, although as a character, I still think Cinder is a better one. The second book actually introduces you to more characters to love and root for. Im not going to ask anymore because I know most of you have already read this book. What are youre thoughts about it? Did you like it, hate it, or arent sure? Leave some of your thoughts down below.
From  At A Glance LOVES!!!! I loved almost everything about The Host. I am totally going to fangirl all over this review because I cant help but squee every time I think of this book. The Good Holy Crap! I dont even know where to start. Oh, oh, I know. If you hated Twilight, never fear, The Host is 100 better. Twilight for me was a fun story about obsession more than love that was badly written. The Host is very well written and has way more substance and character development. I could go on and on about The Host and character development. Thats what made this book The Bomb. Oh yeah, I still use that 90s phrase. Im bringing it back! Each character made me feel so much emotion, so much joy, so much sadness that it felt like I was part of the story. I actually cried near the end of this book. Cried! Me, the unemotional robot actually cried! Stephenie made me care for everyone. They were all multidimensional characters with their own stories, even if their individual stories were not outright told. They had obvious depth and unique personalities. I had to know what was going to happen to them, what was going to happen next. It was a keep reading or die of deprivation scenario. Yup, I was that dramatic while reading this book. The concept was somewhat unique. Sure, we have movies and books with aliens taking over the human race, but The Host felt different. Because its from the aliens perspective and how she comes to love the humans she is meant to dominate. We have Melanie, the body, the human, and Wanderer Wanda, the soul, the alien. Though Wanda has control of Melanies body, Melanie refuses to let Wanda take complete control. She will not be silenced. So Melanie does the only thing she can, she shares memories of the man she loves, Jared, with Wanda. Wanda slowly falls in love with Jared through Melanies memories. But its when they set out to find Melanies lost love that the story really begins. Because this is not a story about an alien takeover. This is a story about friendship, love, and sacrifice. Its about what a species is willing to do for survival. Its also about finding out who you really are and what you are willing to do for the ones you love. The Host is more complex than it seems. Wanda was one of the best characters ever. She has lived many lives, in many bodies. But its Melanie, a girl who wont give up, that changes her outlook on life and humanity. Wanda takes risks for a love that has grown only from memories. But she finds mostly hatred from the rebels from which her beloved lives. Having Wanda fall in love with Jared because of Melanies memories was simply genius. I felt horrible for her when she is attacked and treated like an outcast amongst the rebels, even if I knew that it was logical for them to be cautious of her. Wanda is brave beyond reason though. She is strategic in what she says, what she shares. She knows how to stay alive. And her compassion for others is admirable. Its still hard to grasp the close friendship Melanie and Wanda had considering the circumstances. Then Ian came into the picture and changes everything...for the better. Melanie was also a very strong and determined character. She held on to her soul, her conscienceness and fought with Wanda for control over the body they shared. And her love for Jared was simply beautiful. It kept the whole story going. Jared was a little iffy for me at first, but I grew to love him like Wanda and Melanie did. He was somewhat hardened by the rough life humans now had to live, but he still held on to the kindness and compassion that seems to be ingrained into his person. Ian was a whole other story. He starts out as the bad guy kind of but he turns into the most amazing love interest ever. We should all be so lucky to have someone like Ian in our lives. He loves with wild abandoned and I admire him the more for it. There was just enough action to keep my attention the whole way through. The Host was well written and the plot was well thoughtout. The worldbuilding was interesting and had me wanting to learn more. I love how Stephenie wrote a scifi book that had less to do with the human perspective. This was about the aliens perspective. It was less about a hostile alien invasion and more about human nature in all its glory. I actually read this book years ago and I remembered almost everything about it even today. I rereadskimmed it for this review, but it was unnecessary. This book left such an impression on me that the whole story was imprinted into my mind. The Bad I almost gave The Host my rare 6 stars, but I had to concede that it wasnt perfect. Close, but not quite. The beginning is slow, as well as other parts of the novel. I still wanted to continue reading, I just wish more happened in certain areas. The Snuggly Stephenie labeled this book as Adult but its not. It has a YA feel, especially in the romance department. We only get some kissing and touching. But the sort of love triangle was freakin awesome. I really didnt know how Stephenie was going to handle the relationships in this book since it was all very complicated. But she did an excellent job of giving us a satisfying resolution for each couple. Jared and Melanie, Wanderer and Ian, it was all so romantic and crazy at the same time. Final Thoughts The Host is one of my favorite books of all time. It may not be perfect but its pretty damn close, for me at least. You will grow to love each character with ease. And the storyline will leave you wanting more. Trully, this is not a book to be missed. Highly recommended. Quotes Its not the face, but the expressions on it. Its not the voice, but what you say. Its not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful.  I love you, I whispered. Dont say that like youre saying goodbye. But I had to. I, the soul called Wanderer, love you, human Ian. And that will never change, no matter what I might become. I worded it carefully, so that there would be no lie in my voice. If I were a Dolphin or a Bear or a Flower, it wouldnt matter. I would always love you, always remember you. You will be my only partner.  I held you in my hands, Wanderer, and you were beautiful.  You are the noblest, purest creature Ive ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you, he whispered.
MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. Tartt 40 It is about time I sat down and wrote this review. I have read this book twice, watched many interviews with Donna Tartt about this book, and I have also read her other two books, both of which are also fantastic. With all of this, I can now say with great confidence that, at least for a while, Donna Tartt is my all time favorite author and The Secret History is my all time favorite book. I first read this book in June of 2016. I did really like it, but I did feel like I read it in the wrong time. I was in a reading slump at that point and was still mainly reading classics. My love for modern literary fiction was still brewing. Even though I didnt love it at first, it stayed with me. My thoughts towards the book started to change dramatically and that was when I paid it a revisit earlier this year. After this reread, I knew that this book was something special to me. It was the kind of story that makes you both feel for the characters and want them to fail at the same time. It was the kind of story that captured the full potential of the English language and showcased what truly beautiful writing could do. I was immediately grabbed by the world and characters that Donna Tartt had masterfully created. It proved to the literary world, and the world in general, that literature was not dead and that it was stronger than ever with even more powerful voices on the way. This would only be backed up further by the continuous craze of Harry Potter starting in 1997. I have given my thoughts on the books history with me and what I think it has done to the literary world, but I have yet to really dive into the book itself. I think it is time to really analyze and dive deep into Donna Tartts masterpiece, The Secret History. Lets do this. The story of The Secret History is a murder mystery surrounding six classics students and their outofthisworld professor at the prestigious Hampden University. The main difference between this story and other murder mysteries is that it tells us who kills who and how in the prologue. The rest of the book is about why they did it, thus the book being notoriously dubbed as a whydoneit The main character of this story is ultimately a young man named Richard Papen, who is also the character we are in the perspective of. Richard is then joined with his fellow classics classmates as they start to live with each other in a nearby apartment complex. The leader of this group is a young man named Henry Winter and his character, along with the other classics students, immediately appeals to Richard. Their professor, a man named Julian, gets them thinking in new and dangerous ways, leading them into a dark path they will never emerge from. That is the basic premise of The Secret History. I will try to make this review as spoiler free as possible, but I cant guarantee things. So, the story is an absolute masterpiece. Some parts of the story, especially the aspects of tragedy, correlate with some of the works the students are studying like Ovid, Homer, and Virgil. The way she also turns the murder mystery on its head is beyond genius. I cannot express my awe for it enough. I have seen many authors try this technique after Tartt and the very best impressions barely get the storyline yet still completely dodge the feel of what Donna Tartt did here. Nothing even came close to the expertise of Donna Tartts ideas of taking story types and actual concepts and objects and turning them into an excellent and engaging and innovative plot. This is all done with Donna Tartts masterful writing style that I still get moved by to this day. I have talked about Donna Tartts writing style before and how excellent it is, but she went above and beyond with her debut to make a good first impression and it clearly shows. With all of this amazingness that is packed into this book, can you believe me when I say that I havent gotten to the best part yet? Well, its true. The best part of this book is actually, in my opinion, the characters. These seven characters Richard, Henry, Camilla, Charles, Francis, Bunny, and Julian are most likely the best characters I have ever read. To create my top ten characters in fiction, put these guys in the top seven and add Holden Caulfield, Scout Finch, and Atticus Finch as spots eight, nine, and ten. These characters are the definition of characters that you cant help getting behind despite them being, in reality, horrible human beings. They are doing some horrid stuff to one another and you cant help but feel pity for them. You get to know these characters so well that you dont want anything to happen to them. Even though we are in the perspective in Richard, we see the psyches of the other six so well that it seems like the only thing that makes Richard the protagonist is that we are in his perspective. That is how brilliant this cast is. It makes you confused on who the protagonist really is in a FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE. No other book has ever done that. I could go on about my personal favorite character in this book, that being Henry, but I feel like I have expressed my love for everyone enough. This is just an unbelievable cast. This is an unbelievable book. What did I do to deserve such a masterpiece to enter my life? This is what fiction can do to people. They can help people escape the horrors that are trapped inside the dark realms of reality and enter into a world of wonder and creativity. You can be lost in the world that the author has built, even if it is heavily based around reality like this one is. You can feel like you are there, talking with the characters like you have known them your entire life. You can move the story with just the movement of your eyes and the workings of your train of thought. This is what fiction can do to people. This is what Donna Tartt did to me. I am more than happy to have read this book. I will be constantly rereading this throughout my life. I think this may be the only book I will revisit throuhgout my life. Even Catcher in the Rye has reread limits. I can get lost into The Secret History over and over again until I die. I dont think I can be so engaged in a book ever again. Though that is what I said about Catcher and now look who is on top. I think I have expressed my feelings for this book well enough. I am worried my computer will crash if I type any more. Just read this book. Just read it. Even if you dont like it, you will find some part of it you will like. It is just a masterpiece. The masterpiece I am glad to call my favorite book of all time. I am giving this one a 5 out of 5 stars.
6 Stars!!! In love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are. WOW...Just WOW! This is one BEAUTIFUL book. Ive got ugly tears running down my face right now. I just love this quote and it beautifully and succinctly summarizes this book. For almost a year, Ive heard so much buzz about this book, but somehow I couldnt get myself to read it...maybe because of the historical background. Well, there is a lot of war in this book, but this book is so much more than war. This is a story about humanity and how far we will go to save a stranger. It is a story about family and love. It is an empowering story about the inner strength and endurance of women. It is HEARTWRENCHING! It looks at society and how peoples fear can cloud sound judgment. It asks the hard questions of how far will we go to protect our loved ones? How much can we take before we break? This book follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, and their struggles during World War II. Although sisters, they are not friends. Abandoned by their father at an early age, both struggle to find love, acceptance, and their place in life. As the war comes to France, Vianne and Isabelle find their strength and learn to survive the war. They both grow throughout the process and make their mark on the war. Im not a history buff, but after reading this novel and knowing that Kristin Hannah was inspired by true stories, I am completely in awe and want to learn more about this time period. This book is so wonderful and I have so many emotions running through me right now. Im not sure how to write this review. I guess Ill just tell you about how this book will make you feel and what I hope youll gain from this book. Ill be honest...it took me awhile to really get into the book. Dont get me wrong, the entire book is good, but I wasnt hooked until about 30 so keep reading if you are unsure about this book. At this point I just became so invested in their story and what it must have been like to live through WWII. I was so engrossed in the story; I was emotionally in sync with Vianne and Isabelle. I felt myself trudging along and trying to be strong just like Vianne and Isabelle. Only until the end did I relax and allow myself to grieve for all of their loss. Im grieving and reminiscing on their journey. It is now at the end of the book that I can fully appreciate this story and all the beauty and wisdom it has to offer. Vianne and Isabelle are very different characters. Isabelle is naive, impetuous, and freespirited. In contrast, Vianne is older, wiser, and more responsible and cautious in life. However, both sisters are insecure and flawed in their own way. Each sister takes their own path in the war. Both have their own crises and question ethics, morals, and how to live a meaningful life. They make mistakes, hurt people, and they are both pushed to their breaking pointthey find out who they really are and what they are willing to sacrifice to make a better world. Their growth is beautiful to watch. I could only hope I would do the same in their situation. Dont think about who they are. Think about who you are and what sacrifices you can live with and what will break you. I found myself liking Isabelle more than Vianne which is interesting since I am more like Vianne in real life. I admired Isabelle so much. Her strength and courage was amazing. But as Vianne began to grow and mature, I really started to like her character as well. It was a proud moment when she realizes what she must to do live with herself in the war. She knew now that no one could be neutralnot anymoreand as afraid as she was of risking Sophies life, she was suddenly more afraid of letting her daughter grow up in a world where good people did nothing to stop evil, where a good woman could turn her back on a friend in need. There are so many wonderful messages and lessons in this book. How do we pick up the pieces and move on from such terror? How do we survive such hate? How do we overcome such evil? But love has to be stronger than hate, or there is no future for us. This story emphasizes that our ability to love is one of the most powerful forces. Love keeps the spirit alive. It has the potential to heal, to build and rebuild the future for us. It emphasizes the strength in us women and how we piece it all together and move the future along. It makes me so proud to be a woman. They couldnt touch my heart. They couldnt change who I was inside. My body...they broke that in the first days, but not my heart, V. The story also touches on our need for love and belonging. Isabelle, Vianne, and their father have a strained relationship. No matter how much they try to resist needing one another, their bond and need to be loved by one another is strong and everlasting. A girls love for her father. Immutable. Unbearable but unbreakable. Its a story that emphasizes forgiveness, to live in the moment, and to appreciate and love one another while we are alive. The story has tragedy pervading every scene. Its a realistic story of grief and loss. I like happy endings because I know in life sometimes there are no happy endings. Books are my escape. This story doesnt have a bad ending, just a realistic one that breaks my heart. Some stories dont have happy endings. Even love stories. Maybe especially love stories. However, despite all the loss and grief, there is a silver lining. While the book reminds us that even though not all endings are happy, the life lived and how we lived is what matters. Its the memories and the love found that carry us through. I know now what matters, and it is not what I have lost. It is my memories. Wounds heal. Love lasts. This book will touch your heart and soul. It will make you want to be strong. It will make you feel proud to be a woman. It will make you want to love harder and be better. It is a story of strength, love, courage, and sacrifice. This is a MUST read!!
Review to come! Update 72316: See more reviews on my blog Novels and Necklaces Actual rating: 4.5 stars Your future is not set in stone, my dearest star. A coin turns on itself a number of times before it lands. This was the most amazing sequel to an even more amazingly magical series. I couldnt have asked for a more perfect ending to this duology, and Renee Ahdieh is definitely an author that should go on everyones TBR list immediately. Her writing is absolutely brilliant and every line in this book is so beautifully written. There is something about this world that Ms. Ahdieh has created that never makes me want to leave, and honestly I could have reread this book as soon as I finished. The Rose  the Dagger has a much different feel than the previous installment, as it does not focus so much on romance. However, dont worry, because that romance, while still very present, is not as necessary when compared to everything else that goes on in this story. There is so much to love about this novel, and if you havent checked this out yet, you need to now! It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did not belong to him. It was never about belonging to someone. It was about belonging together. Renee Ahdieh has this way of writing that just evokes so much emotion from both the reader and the characters alike. As soon as you start reading this novel, you are instantly transported back into Shahrzad and Khalids world, and you never want to stop reading. You want to devour every single word of this book because you know it will be utterly amazing. While the romance does take a bit of a backseat, there are plenty of actionpacked scenes that will more than appease readers. But dont you worry, because there are still plenty of swoonworthy moments that will leave you breathless. Their relationship has matured a great deal in the short time since the events of the last book, and because of this, it is much less angsty and fragile, and much more solid and unwavering. The lengths they will go to for each other prove just how dedicated they are to their love. But there is a curse to break and a kingdom that must be saved, and in order to do so lives must be lost and sacrifices must be made. Sometimes, he gasped, the family you choose...is stronger than blood. There are a lot of twists and turns that I never saw coming in this story. Packed with betrayals and shocking surprises, Renee Ahdieh keeps you on the very edge of your seat until the very end. I can honestly say that I wasnt sure how everything was going to turn out. The fantasy elements that were mentioned in the first novel are expanded upon much more, and it made for many exciting moments. Shazi learns more about the powers she has, and we learn more about Khalids curse. Ms. Ahdieh packs a lot of information into the story, however it never feels overwhelming. The pacing of this story is perfect, and everything that is revealed comes at a natural time in the story. The darker the sky, the brighter the stars. Friendships are tested and not everyone is who they appear to be. With betrayals around every corner, even the reader has no idea who to trust. The one character that I was excited to see in this story was Shazis sister, Irsa. She is very different from her sister, and this difference provided a nice dynamic between the sisters. I loved reading how they interacted with each other, and each provided a nice balance to the other. But the thing that truly made her stand out was how she overcame her hesitations and fears to become a strong woman in her own right, and very much like her sister. We all know how strong Shazi is on her own, but it was nice to see the inspiration she was to Irsa. Together, the sisters possess a strong bond that allows both of them to empower each other. If you ask me, the best way to go about flying is to cut the strings tying you down. The ending of this novel was even more amazing than the rest of this book. There was definitely a heartstopping and jawdropping moment, and I was close to tears. But trust me when I say that the ending that Ms. Ahdieh delivers is worth every second of that worry over how everything will turn out. The best part of this story and this duology in general is the strong female characters that while flawed, are complex and characters that girls everywhere can look up to. It was easy to be good and kind in times of plenty. The trying times were the moments that defined a man. And love? Love was something that did much to change a person. It brought joy as it brought suffering, and in turn brought about those moments that defined ones character. Love gave life to the lifeless. It was the greatest of all living powers. But, as with all things, love had a dark side to it. Renee Ahdieh has cemented her place as an author that is here to stay. I think its easy to say that she had a lot to live up to given the popularity of the first novel, and she has proven that she can deliver, and will deliver in the best way possible. Was this as amazing as the first story, in my opinion no, however this came very, very close to being just as amazing as the first. I will say that I am happy that this is only a duology as this was the perfect way to end the series. The story wasnt dragged out and it was just enough. There is a power in knowing when a story has been told, and Renee Ahdieh knew exactly what she was doing, which shows even more how amazing an author she is. This is an absolutely beautiful, empowering novel that weaves magic, love, and action into a perfect tale for all ages. Go read this now! Happy reading :
Original post at One More Page One day early this year way before I met the Goodreads people I was going around Fully Booked in Eastwood when I suddenly had this little fantasy. I wondered: what if, as I was looking for books to get, I meet a guy who has the same taste in books as I do? A straight, single guy, near my age, who reads for fun? And lets make him cute, too. It was a little fantasy that my friends and I entertained often, and it almost became a topic of a story for my fiction blog one day I will write that. It was definitely something my single bookish friends and I thought would be very nice but may be rare, as we know few guys who are willing to read the same books we do, and most of the people we see in the bookstore near our office is filled with girls that is, until I met the Goodreads people, again. So its no wonder why Dash and Lilys Book of Dares by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan would call to me. Okay, I didnt really pay attention to it first because I wasnt really a fan of Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist by the same authors, until I read a review. I checked the sample and fell in love with it on the first few pages, particularly on the opening scene. Dash finds a red notebook amidst the books in the Strand, and inside were a bunch of clues left by a girl named Lily. He figures out the clues and thus starts the passing of the red Moleskine notebook back and forth between the two. Dash and Lily accomplish dares all around New York City from each other and bare their innermost thoughts to the other through the red notebook, all the while wondering if the words represent the persons behind them. The story happens during the holidays, so I figured Christmas should be the right time to read it thanks again to Ace for giving me a copy during the Goodreads Christmas party. And I was right. I am so glad I read it at this time of the year. : Like I said, I wasnt very enamored by Nick and Norah, but Dash and Lily really made me fall in love. Theres so many things to love. Maybe it was the bookstore? Maybe its the Moleskine notebook which I love, by the way? Maybe its how the story unfolded despite it being slightly hard to believe? Dash and Lily are two very interesting characters. Theyre not the angsty teenagers that we read in contemporary YA but theyre very smart and witty teens who are very different yet they speak to each other in ways only they can understand. While I didnt find Dash particularly dashing, I thought he was very welladjusted for his age. Perhaps it was all the reading that he does that makes him a gentler version of the male gender? I dont know, but Id like to think so. Lily, on the other hand, is probably the most optimistic female character Ive ever read so far. She reminds me of myself in so many ways: she bakes, she likes animals, her positive outlook, and in how shes never had a boyfriend. Lily is such a delight to read because I feel like Im reading some things I write, almost like I was reading my journal. And just as the characters, the story was very charming. It tried to tackle more than the usual boymeetsgirlandtheyfallinlove story and thats good, but sometimes the connections and issues feel a bit too messy and hard to follow. The entire interaction may seem a bit farfetched too, and I dont think this will be very effective here in Manila, but I can forgive that for the sake of fiction and thats why it happened in New York and not here, LOL. Despite that, though, I thought the plot was wellexecuted, and I found myself hanging on to every word all the way up to the end. My copy of Dash and Lilys Book of Dares has so many dogears too because of the quotable quotes! For example: Prayer or not, I want to believe that, despite all evidence to the contrary, it is possible for anyone to find that special person. That person to spend Christmas with or grow old with or just take a nice silly walk in Central Park with. Lily, p. 75 I wish I could remember the moment when I was a kid and I discovered that the letters linked into words, and that the words linked to real things. What a revelation that must have been. We dont have the words for it, since we hadnt yet learned the words. It must have been astonishing, to be given the key to the kingdom and see it turn in our hands so easily. Dash, p. 87 You think fairy tales are only for girls? Heres a hint  ask yourself who wrote them. I assure you, it wasnt just the women. Its the great male fantasy  all it takes is one dance to know that shes the one. All it takes is the sound of her song from the tower, or a look at her sleeping face. And right away you know  this is the girl in your head, sleeping or dancing or singing in front of you. Yes, girls want their princes, but boys want their princesses just as much. And they dont want a very long courtship. They want to know immediately. p. 131 And my favorite and is very applicable for the coming year: There are just lots of possibilities in the world...I need to keep my mind open for what could happen and not decide that the world is hopeless if what I want to happen doesnt happen. Because something else great might happen in between. p. 227 The blurb was right. Dash and Lilys Book of Dares is a feel good book that would make you want to start ...perusing bookstore shelves, looking and longing for a love and a red notebook of their own. It doesnt have to be Christmas when you read it, but the holidays add to the ambiance. Its the kind of book that will surely leave you smiling long after you have read the last word. : Im not about to start looking for a red notebook in Fully Booked...but as for leaving one? Ill never tell. ;
He also wouldnt say if he was a drug dealer or not. And he didnt even mention the gangbanging stuff. Does it matter thought? He didnt deserve to die. Well, holy crap. This book punched me in the gut. Repeatedly. I cried. Over and over. I cried reading it in my apartment. I cried reading it in the mall. I cried reading it in the dimly lit theatre before my movie began. You will feel angry reading this book. And you should. If you have experienced this, there will be the anger that comes from being part of an unjust shared experience. If you are privileged enough to have avoided this experience, like me, you should feel angry that this shit happens every day and yet we are adding names to the depressing list of unarmed people of color being murdered by the people who some of us were taught are there to protect. When I was a child, I was told to find a police officer if there was trouble. Others were taught how they needed to act and react to avoid getting killed. Corporate America dont bring jobs to our communities, and they damn sure aint quick to hire us. Then, shit, even if you do have a high school diploma, so many of the schools in our neighborhoods dont prepare us well enough...Our schools dont get the resources to equip you like Williamson does. Its easier to find crack than it is to find a good school around here. The first time I was really, truly aware of my privilege was embarrassingly late in life. I saw a cartoon that showed a race. The white man started down the track and had few obstacles in his path. The black man was positioned noticeably further behind with loads more obstacles keeping him back. This book is so important in that, among many other things, it highlights this issue. When your basic life circumstances put you so much further behind everyone else, it can be damn near impossible to catch up. Starr and her brothers are sent to a predominantly white school in an effort to help them navigate some of those obstacles on the track. Although they may be getting a better education than they would in their neighborhood, it presents an entirely new set of issues. Starr attends a party in her neighborhood and leaves with a childhood friend after a fight leads to gun fire. A cop pulls them over and shoots her unarmed friend. Along with the horror of seeing her friend murdered right in front of her, she must go back to her school and play a role. She has to watch what she says, lest her white friends think she is too ghetto. I should be used to my two worlds colliding, but I never know which Starr I should be. I can use some slang, but not too much slang, some attitude, but not too much attitude, so Im not a sassy black girl. I have to watch what I say and how I say it, but I cant sound white. Shit is exhausting. Everyone at her school just assumed that she would date the only other black student who wasnt a sibling of hers. They make comments that are racist without a second thought because Starr isnt like them. It was so uncomfortable to read. I frantically reflected back on some of the things that Ive said mindlessly as an ignorant teenager. I had no excuse. If I said anything as thoughtless as some of the things in this book, it can be blamed entirely on my privilege and ignorance, and I am ashamed. Im not apologizing for what I felt, I say. I dont care what your intention was, Hailey. That fried chicken comment felt racist to me. This point is so important. Words have meanings that go beyond their basic definitions, and raciallycharged language is just that  racist. Another good example from this book also said by white, blonde Hailey was the crack about an Asian character eating cat for Thanksgiving. I applaud Angie Thomas for addressing this, and I just hope that the people who need to hear it are reading this book. Hell, I hope everyone is reading this book. This book is a response to Black Lives Matter, and it is perfection. It is all of the things that make us human. It is gritty and dirty and violent and depressing and infuriating and hopeless and romantic and heartwarming and funny and brilliant and hopeful all at once. I didnt even think it was possible to encapsulate so many fighting emotions in the telling of one incredibly important story. God, I dont even know what to point out that stands out above the rest. Every page, every paragraph, every word is crucial to the incredible whole. If I had to pull something out, I would say that what I loved most were those tiny, beautiful glimpses into a strong, resilient community. I tense as footage of my neighborhood, my home, is shown. Its like they picked the worst parts  the drug addicts roaming the streets, the brokendown Cedar Grove projects, gangbangers flashing signs, bodies on the sidewalks with white sheets over them. What about Mrs. Rooks and her cakes? Or Mr. Lewis and his haircuts? Mr. Reuben? The clinic? My family? Me? Mr. Reuben remembers everyones order at his shop. Mrs. Rooks makes cakes that are unmatched in excellence. Mr. Lewis, grumpy though he can be, runs the barbershop. Starr and her family own a store where people dip in and out all day grabbing bags of chips, sodas, and any other convenience needs. All of these places and all of these people have the most incredible sense of community. I watch Foty Ounce help Mrs. Pearl. People around here dont have much, but they help each other out as best they can. Life has really screwed over a lot of people in this novel. Even the drug runners and gangbangers have stories. When your prospects are grim because you are a victim of circumstance and your family owes money and you feel as though youve been backed into a corner, desperation will win out. Despite that, the community comes together  to defend their own, to protest injustice, and to rebuild. All I can say is READ THIS BOOK. If the timely and critically important political statement isnt enough to get you scrambling to the nearest bookstore or library, then read it for the characters. I loved them. What a remarkable ensemble! Starrs parents are in my top three alltime favorite parental teams. I have something to add. Lord, bless my mom, and thank you that she went into her retirement fund and gave us the money for the down payment. Help us turn the basement into a suite so she can stay here sometimes. No, Lord, Daddy says. Yes, Lord, says Momma. No, Lord. Yes. No, amen! There is death. It is an unfair, enraging, and emotionally exhausting murder. It is so much more devastating when you see this happening in real life on TV and on your Facebook and Twitter feeds Every. Single. Day. There are protests in this book. There are riots. There is a mass of unquelled fury. BUT. There is also love. There is personal growth. There is the promise to keep fighting. There is determination. And there is hope. This book should be required reading for anyone who tries to speak over POC. For anyone who wants to erase the very real, excessive, and unnecessary deaths of unarmed black men and women. For anyone who overuses their All Lives Matter hashtags whilst simultaneously excusing the murders of these men and woman because of some real or perceived wrongdoing by the victim. As though falling in with the wrong crowd or making a poor life choice or even just being in the wrong damn place at the wrong damn time should be punishable by death. As if the crime of being black should be punishable by death. It may do nothing for the minds that have already been closed for good, but maybe, just maybe, it can pierce through and lead to a deeper understanding of this immensely complicated issue. This is a heavy book about heavy things. I expect a degree of sociopathy is to blame if you are able to read this novel and not leave it with a tearsoaked tissue or, at the very least, a respect for the complexity of these social issues. We have got to do better. TL;DR? Read this book.
When I received The Screaming Staircase to review, I instantly knew I was going to love it. It sounded like it had a unique premise as you dont generally get many books yhese days that focus on a ghosthunting agency. And I did love it. More than I thought I would. I dont do horrorghost stories or movies, however, because this book was written so incredibly perfectly, I felt the perfect blend of fearfulness but not that feeling of complete terror. There were some hairraising moments. Moments where I would move from the room I was currently occupying to a room where my parents were sitting, moments where when it started growing colder in the room my thoughts would immediately think This is what happens when a ghost is near, moments where I regretfully had to put the book down to sleep, I would stay away a little longer listening to any abnormal sounds and having an accelerated heartbeat if I did hear anything which would more often than not turn out to be a pigeon, seeking comfort on my roof. And whilst reading some of Lockwood, Lucy and Georges adventures, I would get a shivering unease creeping through my body as to not knowing what would happen next to the characters I loved, however, I can honestly say I loved every single minute of it. Lockwood  Co: The Screaming Staircase is about a small, unknown ghost agency in London, made up of three youngsters, Lockwood, George and the newest employee, Lucy, who takes up the role as junior field operative. These three together make up Lockwood  Co, which is a small, but very talented agency, amidst hordes of larger, popular agencies. Many ghost hunters have been needed since the start of the Problem, 50 years ago, when ghosts started occurring more and more and unleashing their pent up fury of innocent humans. In London, people happily go along their business as long as the sun is up, but when the dark starts to invade they hurry home to get safely inside where they will be protected by the iron doors, the lavender and the ghost lamps. When Lockwood and his agents embark on a case that goes quite awry and the house ends up in flames, their barelythere reputation dwindles even lower. However, when they are offered a highprofile case for a generous amount of money by one of the richest men to reside in London, owner of an iron supplier company, Lockwood  Co cant turn down the offer. However, before they accept the case, they need to do a long think...is risking their lives to save their business by spending a night in one of Britains most haunted houses worth it? The plot was amazing, there were so many unexpected surprises, so many bloodcurdling moments, a mystery within a mystery. There was nonstop action. And nonstop one. Jonathan Stroud is an incredible writer, to so artfully create such an impeccable book. There was not one minute that I wasnt enjoying myself. He managed to create the perfect blend of horror, humour, seriousness and fun into this already fantastic book. The pacing was neither too fast, nor too slow, I was constantly gripped by the authors words and could scarcely lift my eyes from the page. When I had to put the book down to study or do chores, all that would occupy my mind was as to what was going to happen next. This book should come with a warning that states how much fun you are going to have reading it, and dont pickit up unless you have a few days free time. The characters were utterly perfect in their own right too. Lucy, the narrator of the novel was perfect! She was feisty, brave and sarcastic too, and I admired her for being so brave as to go and kill some terrifying ghosts. I also loved however, that through her bravery, she also let us see that there were times she was seized by complete, overwhelming terror, I loved how she revealed her inner emotions to us, she had her flaws and showed us she had emotional depth. Definitely one of my new favourite heroines. I also loved Lucys Talent. The way that she could sense the fear, pain and utter terror when a certain ghost is in the vicinity. I loved how we, as readers, could feel like we were experiencing the emotions too and how at times we could sympathise with the ghosts our self. Then there is the owner and leader of Lockwood  Co, from the moment I was introduced to him, I instantly fell in love with his whole character and personality. He was friendly and sweet. Whenever someone was rude to him or disparaged him or his business he would be friendly and polite anyway. However, despite his spirited, vibrant, carefree attitude, there was an underlying sadness that I sometimes witnessed, as he has been through a lot and despite his best efforts to be brave and dauntless, you can sometimes see the sadness he carries. I really admired Lockwood though, he was just a young boy running a company, which, at times, received criticism. He exuded maturity and did whatever he needed to be done in a professional manner. And when someone did belittle his company, or his young age, he rose to the unspoken challenge and proved numerously that Lockwood  Co is indeed the best there is. Then there was George who I found extremely likeable and I think he made the book even better although it was already fabulous from the beginning. He was such a cute character and I felt that sometimes he was overlooked and placed in Lucy and Lockwoods shadow. He was the cautious one in the agency, the one that wanted to thoroughly look into a case and he was the one that generally ended up saving everyone by his precise planing, thirst for knowledge and witty humour. Another thing I must praise before I end this review, is that I love the witty, sarcastic banter between the characters. I love it when authors are able to bring some light as to what would perhaps be a dark book, otherwise. Their personalities and the relationships between all the characters were extremely well developed. I trust that if you read this novel, you will fall in love with them all, as I did. Lockwood  Co: The Screaming Staircase is an utterly outstanding novel that everyone must have the pleasure of reading! As you read it, you will enjoy being immersed into the eerie, hairraising atmosphere and shrieking at some moments from terror, and at other parts because of sheer delight! The characters are immensely real and once you close the book, you just want to start it from the the beginning all over again so that you can spend time drinking tea, plotting plans and, of course, eating doughnuts. This book is unputdownable, and will have you transfixed until you read the last page. The storyline was phenomenal too and I wasnt expecting that resolution at all! The second book cant come sooner. I give it: 55 CUPCAKES!
 REVIEW IS UP ON MY BLOG AS WELL! Colleen Hoover is probably one of my favorite authors to ever live! I have been reading her books for years! And not to brag or anything but like most people in the literary world I have read each and every one of her brilliant books! Reading Colleen Hoovers books is addicting. I think she herself might even be addicting! I started this book late one night in the week, but due to a busy schedule with school, I put off reading it. So one night I just decided to read one page that always makes me want more and this was no different but I was too tired to continue on. A few nights later we were in full swing! I really hoped I couldve read this book in one night but I just couldnt. The first thing I want to say is I started reading this book and then did something completely stupid! I used to read the end of the book before the beginning but I dont do that anymore. Now with this book I never read the synopsis, nothing, I mean its Colleen Hoover, you dont need those things with her, shes just truly amazing! So about a quarter way through the book I got curious and went to read the synopsis, about twenty minutes later I was so super curious and of course had to go and read the end! And well I still adored Ryle at that point, but I read the Authors Note and started making conclusions! I mean how stupid could I have been! Well, I will say this, though, the writeup and the Authors Note intrigued me so much that, that was the night I stayed up until 3AM to finish reading It Ends With Us. But anyway you guys dont want to read about my stupid crazy rant about my process of reading! You want to know about the book! Well, it was surprising... It Ends With Us was the first Colleen Hoover book that I felt was very Harlequin romance in the beginning! Like a billionaire romance novel with a twist! Being a teenager I absolutely loved that! I felt the feeling of the billionaire and the heroine, and I just loved that! The minute I read about Ryle I was grinning and honestly I loved him! Of course, everything I thought I knew I didnt. I really thought this was just going to be amazing and very adult! I thought there wasnt going to be anything sad about this book! Maybe just a challenge from Lily. Damn was I wrong! This book had me thinking about it for a long time after I read it! I was shocked and loved it so much! This is 100 a fivestar review for me! This is Colleen Hoovers best book yet! I didnt love November Nine as much as I loved Colleen Hoovers other books but It Ends With Us made up for all of that! I mean I was moved! I loved the atmosphere of this book. Like the surroundings. The building Allysa and eventually Lily lived in sounded so amazing! The City, the whole atmosphere of the book was amazing! Oh and Marshall! God how I loved Marshall! He was the sweetest, funist, funniest character ever! Somehow I imagine him to be British... Even though he isnt. Lol. All the time jumps in this book was perfect! It made It Ends With Us even more real and not rushed at all! It was done at a very nice pace. They were everywhere they were supposed to be. The time jumps also helped not drag out the book. Now I want to talk about the characters! I dont want to say much about the storyline because I will just give it all away. Lily was the best character ever! I loved her thinking, her creativity! I mean her flower shop sounds amazing! Where can I find a flower shop just like that? Lily was strong and real! She was compassionate and she loved Ellen! I mean how cool is that! Lily was very smart as well; I mean she never did anything stupid! Her choices were so bold and big! She loved intensely I could tell that her love was infinite and her love for little Emerson was just so special! I know we only got to see that part very little but her love for Emerson shined! Ryle, Im sorry to say this... But he was, unfortunately, my favorite character. In my last blog post, I mentioned that I sometimes loved the villains... And in this case, I loved the villain! I actually wanted him to change! I know the book wouldnt be the same if he did, but I loved his character so much from the first few chapters. But everything he did was repulsive... I do think he is going to be a good daddy to Emerson though. If Im honest I when I started reading the book I didnt think anything would change his mind about his career. I didnt think theyd even have a little baba, I thought the book was going to be very career orientated... But I loved Colleen Hoovers ideas much better! I think Im too cliche. Ryle was a very complicated character, he looked so put together, but he was just so broken... I still think he is going to love that little girl with all his heart, but in the end, something tells me he will probably be alone forever. Atlas... Atlas... Atlas... I was rooting for Ryle... I really wish I was the type of person to just leave it at that. Lol. His character was just sad. I felt sorry for him as a youngster and Im happy things worked out for him... He was truly a good guy. But still, I was rooting for Ryle... I feel so bad saying that! I feel like a terrible person saying that... I really wish there was a second book to It Ends With Us. I loved the story behind It Ends With Us. I love what this book stands for, I think a lot of women would agree with me and say that this was a very eyeopening and inspiring book. I loved how real it was! Everything that happened was so realistic! And the connection the book had with Colleen Hoover was amazing, its one of the reasons I have so much respect for this book, for Colleen Hoover, and for Colleen Hoovers mother. I wish I could hug Colleen Hoovers mother. It would be like hugging Lily, to me she is Lily. This book was quite special to me. Probably one of the most special books in my life, I shared it with someone. Waiting for the book to come out I shared my favorite quote from the book with someone, and when that person left my life and wasnt in it anymore it hurt me to pick up this book. In the first few chapters of this book I thought I was Lily and he was Ryle, it just seemed so fitting to us, maybe it was. Maybe Colleen Hoover just saved me. In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me. To Colleen Hoover, I dont know if youll ever get to see this but if you do know I love your books and this book was truly special. I loved it and understood it in so many ways. You have no idea! You touch lives with your writing and your authors note was so sad but so good at the same time. Thank you so much for writing this book. So my lovelies this was a tough one! But a good one!
Plot 8.510 Characters 910 Writing 910 World Building 910 TOTAL 8.810 Review Everyone knows and loves the tale of Cinderella. So when I heard that there was a book that takes this beloved fairy tale and adds in a dystopian society with talking androids and a killer lunar colony, I was very much intrigued. I decided to pick the story up, and I was definitely not disappointed. Cinder is a gifted mechanic who lives with a cruel foster mom and two foster sisters. She is treated like crap because she is a cyborg, and over 30 of her body is made with steel. This book was really entertaining in two ways; aside from the traditional plot devices found in YA fiction, like fast pace, action, suspense, and mystery, there was also the added benefit of searching for parallels to the original fairy tale of Cinderella, as well as detecting certain aspects where the author has strayed from the original story. This made Cinder a very intriguing read; there were plenty of things to think about and note during every page. The plot is great; its really got everything that a novel should have. Cinder isnt really all out action although the climactic ending scenes offer plenty of that, but the plot is very gripping even without it. Theres plenty of mystery and suspense all throughout the book. There are so many questions about the world that even the main character cant answer. What is the deal with Cinders past? What are the hidden motives of the Lunar colony? Who can Cinder trust? Is there a cure for the plague? There are so many mysteries for the reader to think about as the book goes along. And, as mentioned before, the climax is very exciting there are lots of plot twists, many revelations, and a lot of gritty action. My only problem with the plot was that it was too predictable. There were lots of mysteries to keep me interested in the story, but I found that some of them were too easy to solve. I had already built up some suspicions about exactly who Cinder was about a third of the way through the book, and I found out near the end that I was right. I think that in some cases, the author made the hints too obvious and hard to ignore. I think the books impact on the reader could have been stronger if all of the hints were a bit more subtle and harder to detect. It certainly would have provided more of an emotional shock when all of the reveals came at the end. The characters were really terrific. Cinder was an admirable lead she was courageous, willing to sacrifice, and very much driven by her values. She did frustrate me several times with some of the decisions she made, but I suppose that her failures make her that much more human and relatable. I really liked the portrayal of Cinders family. Cinders foster mom, Adri, is just as cruel as the original stepmom in Cinderella. She is unwilling to treat Cinder as a human and unwilling to give her basic rights and privileges, forcing her to do all the work to support the family, and blaming tragic circumstances on her very existence. She was utterly disgusting, and I actually found myself hating her more than the real villain Queen Levana. The stepsisters were really interesting. In Cinderella, both of the stepsisters are fairly cruel. However, in Cinder, Marissa Meyer made one of the stepsisters Peony very compassionate and loving towards Cinder. I loved the relationship between Peony and Cinder; Peony felt sorry and sympathetic towards the familys unjust treatment of Cinder, and Cinders love for really the only person close to her was apparent throughout the book. This relationship was also hit with sudden tragedy, and to see both of them struggle through times of tribulation made the book very emotionally captivating and compelling. Prince Kai was very well developed. Hes not your typical prince; he doesnt let fame get to his head, he is very grounded and remains connected to his moral values, and he sincerely wants what is best for his people. Its also emphasized that even though hes a prince, hes still human. He has his fair share of awkward, dorky moments, and scenes when he feels hurt and shy, and it takes a while for him to recover from these emotions. I have always respected male characters who are easily driven and affected by emotions, and Prince Kai is no exception. I think his relationship with Cinder was great it was developed gradually, and even when there were impediments blocking them from being together, Kai kept rather adorably trying to make it happen without being too pushy. The book ends with a bit of a cliffhanger regarding Cinder and Kais relationship, and it will be interesting to see how things unfold between the two of them. Something else worth noting about the characters is how Meyer gives the androirds personalities and emotions to make them seem more human. A really good example of a media work that gives life to machines or androids is Astro Boy, which is a movie where the main character, a robot, is given emotions, memories, and a distinct personality that makes him likable and easy to root for. Meyer achieved similar success in Cinder, particularly through the android Iko. Iko, Cinders personal android, was given a certain personality that, even though she was a robot, still allowed readers to develop a connection to her. I hope her development as something more than an android continues throughout the series. I dont really have much to say about the writing other than that it was clear and effective. Marissa Meyers real talent isnt exactly related to what she does with phrases and sentences; her talent is in taking a wellknown fairy tale and molding it into a futuristic, exciting, and suspenseful story that offers a good balance of references to the traditional Cinderella story as well as new twists that enhance the story. I am excited to see what she does with the story of the Little Red Riding Hood in the next installment, Scarlet, and how the stories of Scarlet and Cinder will collide.
4.5 stars This review also appears on my blog, Reading with Jenna. Everything Everything is a wonderful book about taking risks and living life to its fullest potential. While it did tackle some serious issues, the overall tone of the book for me was quite lighthearted and it felt very refreshing. This book made me feel so hopeful and happy that I forgave some of its flaws. I was very intrigued from the first time I heard about this book and I preordered it way back in May. Ive read a lot of contemporary books about mental illnesses and one trope that we see a lot of is the love cures all trope. I was interested in Everything Everything because our main character, Maddy, suffers from a physical illness that cant be magically cured by love. Ill get into this a little bit more later in my review. This novel contains beautiful illustrations throughout it and these are actually done by Nicola Yoons husband, David Yoon. I thought the illustrations added a lot to the story and really enhanced it. This book is written in very short chapters, sometimes only a page long, and is filled with notes that Maddy has written, as well as instant message exchanges between characters. I loved the different mediums that were added to the story. I thought it made the book fun and hopeful instead of serious and sad. The little notes and illustrations we got were my favourite part of the book. So lets discuss the plot and the themes. In Everything Everything, Maddy has a serious illness that prevents her from doing anything, including going out or even having visitors in her own home. Shes well and alive as long as shes kept a prisoner in her own home, with only her mother a physician and her fulltime nurse for company. We actually dont get very much information about Severe Combined Immunodeficiency SCID, which is the syndrome that Maddy has that makes her allergic to everything. There were times when I wished we had gotten a bit more information about SCID, just to satisfy my curiosity, but for the most part I was happy to accept the little information that we were given. I also sometimes prefer that books dont go into a lot of detail and include a lot of jargon because I encounter so many books that misrepresent mental illnesses. So its probably better when authors dont write too much about things they dont know about. For me, the last quarter of the book and the plot twist were kind of predictable. It was obvious to me that that was the direction that the plot would take. Its probably the best way that everything could have turned out, but I almost wished that it had ended differently so things didnt happen just to make the romance work. It was a bit disappointing that it still ended up being a bit of a love cure all type of book. There were also some things that I found VERY unrealistic, but I dont want to spoil anyone so I wont mention what they are. I really loved watching Maddy grow in this book. She starts off as a pretty passive character but slowly grows into somebody who learns to take risks and experience the unknowns in order to truly be alive, even at the expense of her own life. I loved seeing Maddy appreciate things that I would normally take for granted and I enjoyed seeing the world through Maddys eyes as she encountered new things, such as travelling in a car for the first time. I liked her willingness to try new things. There were times when I felt she was being too reckless and it seemed too out of character for her to be risking her life for a few moments of fun. And I also felt that she was a bit inconsistent in her thoughts about whether shed rather be trapped in a room or dead from doing things that normal people do. Overall, I really liked Maddys character. It was easy to connect with her and read from her point of view. Shes also a book nerd! There were times when I forgot she was 18 because of her innocence. But I loved that she was able to develop and start to take control of her own life. I thought Olly was a great romantic interest for Maddy. Hes very caring and loves his family, and he seemed like the perfect person for Maddy. I did think that their relationship was very instalovey and developed too quickly for my liking. It was understandable that Maddy would be drawn to Olly because hes probably the first teenage boy shes ever met, but I didnt understand Ollys interest in Maddy. They pretty much fell in love without even speaking a single word aloud to each other, and I didnt think that was very realistic. I still thought they were adorable together and I loved reading about their relationship. I liked how real the characters felt and that they each had their own issues to deal with. Ollys father is mentally and physically abusive to his wife and kids, and that added an interesting dynamic to the story. The first half of the book makes a lot of emphasis on the black rubber band that Olly wears and keeps snapping on his wrist. That made me a little bit worried that he was suicidal, because snapping a rubber band against your wrist is a common behaviour that is used as a substitute to cutting. At this point, I was a bit worried about where the story was going to go, but luckily it never went in that direction. There were some mental health elements in the book, but they were never explored very far before the book was over. I do like that the novel had a very open ending. It was a very satisfying and cute ending to the book. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I will probably reread it again in the near future.
Don Quixote  A Book Review in Three Sallies The First Sally The story of Don Quixote is one that plays itself over and over again. In real life and in literature, to the point where it is hardly clear where one story ends and another begins. Manager: Customer renewal rates! Me: Senor, are you referring to those windmills. A story of a person fighting metaphysical monsters only he can see. At this very moment, Im typing this review as if its the most important thing in the world. Meanwhile, a mere ten feet away, my boss in contemplating other things  operating expenses, renewal rates  that to me seem fantastic, the ramblings of a lunatic. Don Quixote is raging against the death of chivalry. My own quest is to preserve that which is beautiful and sacred in the written word. The book does bring up uncomfortable questions about the nature of ones reading life to ones real life. What happens when the stories you read become more real than the real world? These days, people tend to worry more about kids playing video games or becoming absorbed in social media. Its fitting that the book begins with Don Quixote neglecting the matters of his day on account of books. Books are what draw him into his fantasy world and into the ideal life of chivalry. Toward the end of the book, especially, we see Don Quixote, the fanboy of chivalry and adventure, on full display with his knowledge of history and chivalric knowhow. So much so, that I want to abandon my suit and tie and don full armor just like Don Quixote. The old question  who is to say who is the lunatic and who is the realist? For me, the fantasy of books is necessary to validate the mundane lunacy of an office environment. The Second Sally The tale of Don Quixote has gotten me interested in other realityfantasy hybrids  Joe the Barbarian, I Kill Giants, Tough Girl, The Wizard of Oz. At the foundation of these stories is the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with the world as it is presented. Their stories are one of redemption by a lonely outsider. Think Batman! You will see many similarities between Don Quixote and Batman! When I was growing up, there was an oil painting in my living room. It showed Don Quixote with his brilliant lance and shining armor facing a field of windmills. By his side was his trusty Sancho Panza Alfred Pennyworth!. My thought was that this was classical romantic literature. I actually had no idea what classical literature was. I also wasnt very romantic. I was only in third grade at the time. But that Christmas I received a box set of illustrated kids versions of classical literature. And there my adventure began! Huck Finn, Wizard of Oz, Oliver Twist... My mom, being from Cuba, had of course read Don Quixote many times in its original Spanish. That was why the picture was on our wall. And thats also why  and this I kid you not  in an earlier house we had a suit of knights armor. I dont know what happened to it. And we didnt have it long enough for me to grow into it. I wanted to read this book partly for my mom; partly to make my workday feel normal. Its fitting that I stole 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there to read this book. Its fitting that I neglected adult life to do this. My mom would be proud. Jason, a reviewer on Goodreads, writes: Ive discovered that Don Quixote is not a bumbling idiot  far from it, in fact. He is highly intelligent, highly perceptive and observant, and most surprisingly, and in spite of all his delusions of being a knighterrant, he is actually selfaware. This makes me feel better about the lunacy that is my life. After all, Im in my midthirties. Im unmarried; have cultivated a romantic anticareer, and have fed my book addiction in a way that would make Mr. Quixano blush. And yet, I am selfaware. I realize that books have driven me further and further to the fringes  like other lunatics of fantasy. And without the crutch of a Sancho Panza or Alfred Pennyworth. If I am a lunatic, I am a selfaware lunatic. And while my writing and reading habits have made me quite poor and circumspect to managers who look at renewal rates and other such seemingly realistic fantasies, they also make me better. Of his chivalry affliction, Don Quixote said, For myself I can say that since I have been a knighterrant I have become valiant, polite, generous, wellbred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart. And now I find myself a king! These words  found on the Gutenberg digital library  have given me a kingdom to myself. The mad king in his mad kingdom finds willing participants in the manufacture of passages such as these: the reason of the unreason with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty; and, the high heavens, that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves. Yes, I know why Don Quixote donned the armor. To what other kingdom can these treasures be exported? If these passages sound so beautiful in translated English, to think what they must sound like in the original Spanish. As I say these words, I am happy to read this book and think of my mom, who came from Cuba loved this book and read it frequently in Spanish. Not Dulcinea. No, her name was just Dulce. The Third Sally The history of the third sally to this book review could not be found. It is thought that there were many historic deeds done during this third attempt at a book review. However, due to poor historical records, the writer of this actual book review has only hearsay. Some say that he developed a callous on his right middle finger from all the typing he was doing and had to apply for workers compensation or some other such fantastical concept that could only exist in the 21st century before the rise of Literary Society as we know it today. Epilogue The book ends with Don Quixote apologizing for all the harm he has caused and forswearing anything to do with chivalry or knighthood. It is an ending decisively against the idealism and fantastic adventures that the reader has indulged in with Don Quixote. One wonders what to make of it. Despite this finale, I like to imagine the book hanging on a razors edge between proselytizing the virtues of idealism and warning against its dangers. I also imagine it questioning who the realist is and who the madman. But first, dangers! For there are many dangers in our age. For every benign lunatic like me, there are other idealists, some of them rulers of real kingdoms living in bizarre fantasy worlds denying some realities climate change, electoral results while extolling their favored fantasies media conspiracies; these people would reverse the usual order of these words as we know them and claim us of the literary society as the lunatics. An appreciation of the relativism of lunacy, truth, fact, and other not so trivial things artistic or otherwise only works in their favor. The battle is not new. Manager: Look at these renewal rates. What do you see? Me: Nothing. Nothing in comparison to the heartfelt tale of this man of La Mancha Don Quixote  Miguel de Cervantes. Nothing in comparison to the tale of Joe and his trek amongst the barbarians Joe the Barbarian  Grant Morrison. Nothing in comparison to the epic story of the girl and toughness Tough Girl  Libby Heily. Nothing compared to my own adventures in the land of literature.
5 freakinfucktastic stars!!! ARC PROVIDED 20130326: I just finished it! I want to cry. I didnt want it to end. I couldnt stop reading. I love this book. Its my favorite book, by far, HANDS DOWN. I need to gather my thoughts. I have so much, TOO much to say! Ill be back and it will be the best damn review I have ever written. 20130327: IM BACK! GAHHHHHHHH! You guys have NO idea how much anticipation I had toward this book! From the moment I found out that Katy was releasing this, I knew that I would LOVE it and love HER for writing such an amazing book! She did just that and REAL blew me away!!! Ok so... omg Im so giddy, hihihihi! REAL is the story of a 24yearold woman named Brooke Dumas, an exsprinter restarting her life as an athlete injury rehabilitator because she had to stop competiting and running due to her own personal injury. Brooke never got over the fact that her dream was crushed on the day that she hurt herself, and she never realized the affect it had on her. When her friend Melanie drags her to an underground boxing match, Brooke meets the notorious Remington Riptide Tate, and from that day, her life was never the same. She embarks on the adventure of a lifetime following Tate and his team on his tour and from the moment they both laid eyes on eachother, they both knew that the attraction they had towards eachother would be stronger than any willpower they both had. As Remington tries to fight the urge to have Brooke and as Brooke tries to figure out the secret behind Tates name, they both realize that they had been helping each other get over their own issues by falling more and more for each other. RIIIIIPTTTTTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIIIDEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! Remington Riptide Tate is probably the hottest book character I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, and Im not even exaggerating. The way Katy descripes him from the getgo is freaking HOT. I have never been so attracted to a male character like this in my life. When Remy first got announced, I felt like I was there with Brooke and Melanie just waiting for him to take his robe off and see him in all his Riptide sexiness, and I did indeed have the pleasure of acquainting myself to him and it was SPECTACULAR! Is he for REAL? I really fucking wish he was. Every single detail of his being is hot and every single word that comes out of his mouth is hot and the fact that he is a boxer? I just lost my panties. Remington...powerful legs, with thick muscles...his shoulders, his biceps, the way the vine tattoo that circles his arms only emphasize how finely formed his shoulders and biceps between them. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! Its getting hot in here!!! Like Brooke said, Remington was too much. Too much male. Too much masculinity and pure raw beast. I. LOVED. IT. Your name, he growls, panting, his eyes wild on mine. Uh, Brooke. Brooke what? he snaps out, his nostrils flaring. With trembling efforts, I pry my hand free and glance frightfully at Mel, who comes behind him, wideeyes. Its Brooke Dumas, she says... Brooke Dumas. He just fucked my name right infront of me... I was literally fanning myself. Literally. From their first interaction, I was hooked and I wanted more and more, and I wanted to get to know Remy SO MUCH more the more I read. The level of hotness is this book is unREAL. Their was so much sexual tension and it made me feel so sexually charged LOL. Remington Riptide Tate would sure as hell be one to make my toes curl. Brooke Dumas... I LOVED HER! She was so confident and so funny and so smart and so SURE of herself. I really loved the fact that she knew what she wanted from the beginning and didnt deny any of her feelings for long. She set her eyes on the prize and didnt give up until she got it. And I just dont know what Im going to do, but I want to make him mine more than Ive ever wanted anything. Even the Olympics. Anyways, to say the least, the story was amazing! It never got boring. There was not one point where I was like OMG this is dragging on too long or OH GOD get to the juicy parts or give me some drama. Trust me when I say that there is enough of everything in REAL. REAL lust, REAL sex, REAL charm, REAL drama, REAL issues  REAL love. Everything about this book is REAL hence the name of it. I ridiculously loved it. The writing was phenomenal  there were so many times when I felt like I was Brooke or Remy. So many times where I wanted to squeeze the hell out of my kindle and then kiss and hug it. If this story was edible, I would cover it with chocolate, whipped cream and strawberries and it it all up so it could never leave my body. If that doesnt show you how good this book is, I dont know what will. So I highly suggest you prepare yourself for April 9th and make sure to purchase this book as soon as its on sale. I guarantee you that you will love it as much as I do. Katy, thanks for allowing me to read REAL ahead of time. I consider myself lucky and it was sincerely a pleasure! Youve got me hooked and I cant wait for MINE. Rest assured that I will be here waiting to support you and PIMP your books 3333 Before I go, here are some of my favorite quotes! You look beautiful. He runs his thumb with desperation along my jaw, and tilts my chin up, kissing my lips, dry and quickly again. So damn beautiful I couldnt take my eyes off you all evening. When I take you, youll be mine, he says, a soft promise in my ear. You tie me up in knots. He presses my mouth with his.......I want to play you a thousand different songs so you get a clue of what... I feel inside me... Why wont you take me, Remington? He groans and pulls me closer. Because I want you too much. You have no right to me, I say in breathless anger. His hand clenches. You gave me rights when you came on my thigh. ...I want you Brooke, for me. I can hurt you, I can do stupid shit, but I... His stare galvanizes me. Im so fucking in love with you I dont even know what to do with myself anymore. Im yours now, and you cant ditch me like you just did. Even if I screw this up, Ill still be your screwip. Not my screwup. My real. SWOON Jullienne or Enne XOXO
What a brilliant book. The moral ambiguity that seeps through all aspects of this novel adds richness and depth that allows for multiple interpretations. Nothing is at it appears. Nicks unreliable narration tries to be honest; yet, creates a myth through selective narration that tells the story of Jim Gatz, a poor farmer who reinvents himself into the wealthy, James Gatz, to win back his wealthy girlfriend, Daisy. Nicks boast that I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known should make the reader suspicious of his narration as he or she meets Nick at the opening dinner party, learns from Daisy and Toms conversation that he is fleeing the Midwest because of pressure by family members to become engaged to a girl back home. Nick never tells the reader this directly, just as he selectively tells the reader Gatsbys background creating the illusion of someone great. Lies. Illusions. Dreams. Impossibilities. Restlessness. Innovation. Selfinvention. You name it. You can find contradictions galore. Even the authors constant oxymorons of elegant...roughnecks to ferocious delicacy add to the paradoxes in the novel. Irony abounds as Gatsby doesnt quite get his masquerade as a remade wealthy man right. He has amassed money through illegal means of bootlegging and shady bonds deals. His mansion has a fake facade and he is the perpetual outsider, never getting the jokes leveled at him or fitting in with the elite crowd he so craves. There is a painful scene where Tom shows up on a horse and Gatsby thinks hes accepted with this wealthy aristocratic group who are actually laughing at Gatsby behind his back. Gatsbys parties have a mix of social classes that reveal his reinvention of himself that isnt enough for Daisy who decides to stay with her immoral husband Tom, because it is safer to be with her own kind. The author captures this historical shift in society and tension where privileged white characters such as Daisy, Jordan, Nick and Tom and their family connections to old money are threatened by the lowerclass Gatsbys of the world who are selfmade and can receive a promotion in the army based on meritocracy. Times were changing in the 1920s with the economy turning toward consumerism and mass production and Scott Fitzgerald shows the contradictions and confusion in characters and national psyche. The materialism is captured in the cars, decadent parties, advertisements, and mansions that challenges established aristocratic families in powerful positions by those that have risen from lower economic statuses. The landscape is becoming mechanized and the resulting alienation can be seen in the character, Gatsby. Gatsby seems most at home behind a machine that he controls such as a hydroplane or car, rather than with others. At his own parties, he is aloof and off to the side or missing  ever the outsider. The rise of the flapper and jazz music was considered rebellious modern expressions by men and women wanting more personal and sexual freedoms mirrored in the infidelities of Daisy, Tom, Nick, Gatsby, and Myrtle. Contradictions abound and are captured in the national psyche as well as the characters. The author questions the ambiguity of national myths that emerged from World War I and captures the wars effects on citizens through moral disillusionment, physical devastation, and loss of faith. The valley of the ashes is Manhattan or the wars physical landscape that reflects the restlessness of people. The eyes of Eckleberg in the advertisement are those of an empty God. There is despair and restlessness in Nicks narration that shows the American dream as a hopeful, optimistic, unattainable, limited, phony, or empty illusion. On the hottest day of the year, the five misfits go on an existential quest to find the meaning in life by going to the valley of ashes. There they find destruction and unfulfillment of dreams. The romantic idealistic Gatsby contrasted with the satirical detachment of Nicks narration is one way the story is elevated in complexity revealing a questioning of established romantic forms and themes. Gatsby doesnt let go of his youthful dreams. Gatsby tries to reinstate the past through an illusion and his capacity to wonder or create an entirely new life with a career and social position through old romantic ideals found in the Victorian society, not the modern one. He lives in the past and this contrast creates a dynamic tension between a man who is hopeful in a hopeless dream. While the war has punctured the dreams of most it hasnt affected Gatsby in the same way. Nick captures this at the end when he imagines how Dutch explorers felt when they first saw Long Island. Nick suggests that when the forests made way for Gatsbys house and ...pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams that people lost the capacity to wonder and while Gatsby made Daisy his impossible object of wonder, it captures his romantic ability to see life in its limitless possibilities whether that green light is a person or new country with possibilities for an ecstatic or orgastic future. His character is contradictory embodying a country that sayss one thing but does another; that has myths that are not based in reality. The novels references to Horatio Algers myth that people can go from rags to riches by reinventing themselves is false. The references to the Benjamin Franklin myth that ties in with the virtues of Poor Richards Almanack is false as well; it says America is the land of opportunity where a person can make it on meritocracy. This is not the case for Gatsby. Fitzgerald pokes holes and shows the ambiguities of the American dream or myth; the reality is that people are affected by socioeconomic status, ethnicity, geography, or family environments and it is not as simple as it seems. Gatsby embraces the dream, but it is a false one. His counterfeit linguistic tic of saying old sport sounds like a reinvented identity. His rainbowcolored shirts and overreaching to remake the world in a creative, rebellious effort to reinvent himself by means of the American dream is overthetop. In the end, he wants money, clothes, and Daisy but finds no fulfillment in this monolithic, obsessive illusion. He cannot fulfill his grand yearning and Daisy falls short of his dream. He has created an object in Daisy that is unattainable. Shes a dream that cannot be achieved or a desire that has been commoditized. He describes her voice as a direct metaphor and not a simile, Her voice is money. Gatsby can never attain his desire but only circle it repeatedly looking at it across a bay and unable to cross the distance to make it happen. He is from immigrant farmers and is never good enough for Daisy, but he just cant let go of the idea that he will be in the same class as her and even though he recognizes on some level she cant give him what he wants he still desires it obsessively. He is a doomed romantic who cant survive in the modern world. He has a vision for the future as being a selfmade man; however, he is a con man. America today is sort of like this with moral disillusionment in politics, public xenophobia, prejudices toward immigrants or marginalized groups, or institutionalized racism. But lets face it  historically, issues such as this have existed in cultures over the centuries. There is something beautiful and optimistic about the unattainable American dream or ideal that is strained by reality and the realism of the ancient or modern world. While Fitzgerald captures a specific time brilliantly in his novel when mass production, industrialization, and rapid scientific advances were upsetting the status quo, it can be applied to other historical eras and is haunting in its contradictions of hope and hopelessness for an idealistic future that doesnt exist. A brilliant book.
4.5 stars I opened The Diviners by Libba Bray fully expecting to fall in love. Honestly, I was all ready crushing pretty hard on the summary, the setting, and the book cover. After finishing chapter one, A LateSummer Evening I LOVE that she names each chapter!, I had to lay down the book and do some deep breathing. I just KNEW this book was my kind of book, and the anticipation of what was to come was exhilarating. I flipped to the back cover and gazed adoringly at Libba Bray, wondering if she had a fan club yet. I liked her on Facebook, followed her on Twitter, and updated my Goodreads so the world would know I had found my next true love. Then, I read chapter two, and I got a little nervous. Did I just prematurely commit myself to a relationship that was destined to fail? Did I just devote my heart to an author and a story that was going to stomp it into the ground, leaving me bruised and bleeding and longing for unfulfilled promises and mourning over wasted potential? Spoiler alert No, I did not. Though The Diviners offers POVs from several characters, the primary main character is Evangeline Evie ONeill. Set in the 1920s, Evie is a thoroughly modern flapper seeking fun, booze, and the occasional romantic encounter. Pretty, spoiled, and a little selfish, she possesses a secret gift that stirs some trouble at home in Ohio. Embarrassed and fearing a law suit, her parents send her to New York City to stay with her odd Uncle Will who runs the Museum of American Folklore, Superstition, and the Occult. He also teaches and assists the police with cases involving the occult. When Evie visits the crime scene of a murdered woman marked with a strange symbol, she discovers her gift may be good for more than party tricks. As she and Will pursue leads and move closer to uncovering the identity of the murderer, Evie must face not only the true nature of evil, but that of her own soul as well. Funny, compelling, and quite sinister, The Diviners is a must read for those who love mystery, horror, andor paranormal books. The setting in this book is mesmerizing. The 1920s is a period in time that captivates many Americans, including myself. Equal rights are nonexistent. Prohibition is demonstrating the dangers of government overreach. However hopes, dreams, and possibility seem to electrify the air. Technology is evolving. Industry is booming. Music is swinging, and dresses are getting shorter. The future feels bright. Anything seems achievable, and New York City is the absolute quintessential backdrop. Developing, expanding, bustling  NYC is the epitome of swank and glitz and darkness and decay. All over the world people laugh and love, cry and die, but it all seems so much more glamorous when it happens in the Big Apple. Throw in the paranormal and it doesnt get much more captivating. The characters. Though most are blatant stereotypes, from Evie the funseeking flapper, to Memphis the soulful poet living in Harlem, I thoroughly enjoyed them. I got off to a rough start with Evie. Yes, she is full of spunk and courage and plenty of moxie. However, she also starts off shallow, immature, and a big, fat liar and for these reasons, along with her proclivity for using the word positutely, I detested her at first. I dont tolerate dishonesty well, and not only was she a liar, she seemed to revel in others lies as well. Selfish and attentionseeking, we just werent meshing. Evie did evolve though. I actually ended up being quite impressed with the way Libba Bray developed Evie. Slowly, naturally,  well done. I loved the other characters all most from the beginning, some more than others. Memphis  sensitive and determined, Theta  tough but vulnerable, Mabel  smart and loyal, Will  wise, but out of touch, Jericho  quiet, intelligent, brooding, Sam  cunning and street smart, with a streak of sweetness  they all had their strengths as well as their flaws, making them totally human and like I previously mentioned, blatant stereotypes. Also, some of them have gifts like Evie. Then there was Naughty John. Naughty John, Naughty John, does his work with his apron on. Cuts your throat and takes your bones. Sells em off for a couple of stones... Creepy. As. Hell. Hes what lurks in your childhood closet and that abandoned, dilapidated house down the street. Hes the chill up your spine for no apparent reason on a warm summer day. He is a nightmare come to life. And he is searching the streets not just for his next victim, but for his next sacrifice. There was a love triangle, which I vehemently object. It detracts from the story and left a bad taste in my mouth. But I fully support the other romance that blossomed out of thin air and took me fully by surprise. More of this romance please, Libba! The writing in this book is absolutely perfect. I felt wrapped in a beautiful, chilling spell every time I opened the pages. Dr. Georg Poblockis office sat at the end of a long hall in a building that smelled of old books and yearning. Yes! I can smell it! It had been April when his mother died, the trees budding into flowers like girls turning shyly into young ladies. Spring, when nothing should be dying. Yes, Memphis, I feel your pain, your anguish. Magical and melodious, Libba Bray is pure wordsmith genius. If you enjoy crime, mystery, the paranormal, historical fiction, or laughing, The Diviners will not disappoint. I had my doubts at times, but they were always fleeting. I now fully trust Libba Bray with my heart and anxiously await the opportunity to prove my growing and everlasting love to her by buying Lair of Dreams, the sequel which will be released August 25th. This book chilled to me to the bone and I cant wait to visit this world again!
I loved the second book! The first one was good, but this was awesome. I loved seeing in detail the culture of District 12 and all the other districts. The book did a great job of fully growing the characters from the previous installment, making Katniss more likable and more caring, and also a little smarter. You could see the pieces slowly coming together, but it wasnt until the end that everything made complete sense. I cant wait for the next installment, but the ends were tied up well so that while cliffhangereque, its not horrific for the wait. I also really liked all the new characters and how no one is as they seem...I really cant wait to see what President Snow does in the next book, hes a truly wonderful villain. Full Review: It has been six months since Peeta and Katniss defied the government and were both crowned victor of The Hunger Games. Six months where things have achieved some sense of normalcy. Katniss family and Peeta now live in the victors village with Haymitch and they are now, more then ever before, an extended family. Katniss still hunts and is uncertain how things are with Gale, there was a tentative kiss, but that could mean anything...But now the tour of the Districts is upon them and Katniss has a rather terrifying visit from President Snow. There is disquiet and rumors of rebellion and Katniss must quell these uprisings with her overwhelming public displays of affection to Peeta to prove once again to the world that she and Peeta are not revolutionaries but two kids so in love they didnt understand the meaning of their actions. But it is obvious that the actions of two kids can not make up for the horrors that people have suffered at the hands of the capital, not even the prospect of Katniss and Peeta getting married can put out the fire that has been lite under these people. The only questions remains...with this year being the 75th anniversary of The Hunger Games, the thrid ever quarter quell...how can the Capital make Katniss pay for what she has done? While I enjoyed the first book in Suzanne Collins series it really did not grip me like Catching Fire did. I think this is down to two distinct factors, more of a glimpse into the post apocalyptic society that is Panem and character growth. In the first book, while I loved what we saw of District 12, it just wasnt enough, we were too quickly taken away to the candy coated world of the Capital, which I dont really like, except as a contrast to the lives in the Districts. While I can see the reasoning for Collins doing this in the first book, seeing as each District is kept compartmentalized from each other, I really wanted to know more. But in a book written in first person narration, we can only expect to know what Katniss knows, which at the beginning is not so much, seeing as she lives within this compartmentalized society. Once she wins though she becomes something more to society, and Im not talking about as a rallying point for a revolution, Im talking about being above those she grew up with in her District, but also being not on the same footing as those in the Capital. Even more so because in District 12 there are only three others like her, but three others who when combined with the other past victors are an oddity to this society, but eventually they become something so much more. So with her new found other status she starts to learn more and therefore we learn more. We get to see the other Districts, though not in as much detail as I was initially expecting within the context of the Victory Tour, it was enough to show Panem more completely. Also later on through Katniss interactions with the other previous victors we learn more about each district, where the seafood comes from, where electronics come from, and by the availability of these goods the uprisings can be charted. Its a whole fascinating structure of Districts as basically serfdoms, and I just cant get enough of it! This is what I was looking for in the first book and I finally got it delivered! But what I find most important is the character development. In the first book Katniss herself as such an autonomous little person, she has her few people who matter to her, but she has basically shut out the world around her. Again, this was on purpose, but she really kept infuriating me with her obliviousness to the world around her, her inability to see that she was loved and respected by those near her, Peeta in particular. When she won, when she finally grasped that the game she was playing meant something entirely different to Peeta, a wall finally cracked, something actually broke through to her. Therefore the Katniss we see in Catching Fire is a little more mature, a little more willing to let people in, a little more willing to expand her family circle and help others. Also a little more willing to fight for those she loves, and not just Prim this time, but for Peeta and Gale and for the past victors. She has forged alliances and not ones that will be easily broken when the time comes, but ones that mean something, ones that she will be willing to risk the wrath of the government for. She had to come to this realization of the world around her in order for her to become the person she needed to be in order to embrace revolution. You can not fight for something you cant grasp. When all you see or feel is that which affects you, then you are never going to hoist the banners, sound the trumpet and fight for the greater good. Katniss has become an empathic being, as have others, even some of the Capitals residents, and as an empathetic person I can relate far better to someone who feels the same and is not so self reliant and walled in. This is a Katniss I can like as well as admire. And who knows...empathy could easily be the emotion that could end these games forever...
From:  The Good Read Hard and Put Away Wet... Okay, I have been sitting her for 10 minutes and I still dont know what to write. I guess it is fitting since Divergent left me speechless. How do I write a review about a book like this? A book that revitalized me, a book that made me bite my nails for the first time in 3 years, a book that ripped out my heart and made me want more. My face actually hurts from the emotions I went through. Ive been caught smiling like an idiot, crying like a wuss, laughing to near hysteria, and waving my hands around from nervousness all while reading Divergent. I swear I found a new wrinkle between my eyes because I read this book so HARD. You ever do that? Reading a book hard is when you squeeze the cover from anxiety, rip the pages in your haste to see what happens next, and having to actually get up and stand while you finish a scene because of your nervous energy. Oh yeah, everyone in my household knows that if I am reading standing up then that book is the BOMB! Dont laugh because I used the word Bomb, I am totally bringing it back. Choose a Faction... Beatrice lives in a world where one of five virtues dictates the rest of a persons life. Once someone turns 16, they must decide which faction virtue they will live with the rest of their lives. You have a choice between Candor the honest, Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Amity the peaceful, and Erudite the intelligent, but once a faction is chosen, there is no turning back. That faction is your family, your only family. Beatrice loves her family, but she struggles with the choice of staying with them within a faction that no longer suits her or going with the faction that has fascinated and called to her most of her life. Finally gaining the courage, she leaves her family, joins a new faction, and renames herself Tris. But the hard part is not over yet. Tris must now survive the horrifying training process, cruel initiates, and political intrigue that might just bring destruction upon the faction system. Tris... I dont think this book would have been the same without Tris. It is her that takes us on a journey of selfdiscovery, the concept of virtues, and the trials one must go through to be accepted. Her struggles between being selfless, brave, and intelligent at the same time were captivating. Its hard for her to be just one, but she knows showing signs of too many virtues can get her killed. She was so meek and small in the beginning that her surviving the training seemed impossible. However, she was like a blooming flower in the sun, the more she was exposed to the life of her new faction, the more she became stronger, resilient, and flourished in her new surroundings. I think any of us could look up to Tris not literally, that girl is short as all getout. She never gave up no matter how much she was hurting or felt unwanted. I Am Number Four... Four is the kind of person youll love and hate through most of the novel. Hes a bit mysterious, somewhat caring, and a whole lot intimidating. He goes through these moods. One day hes as sweet as pie, then the next he is nicking your ear with a knife true story. But underneath his mood swings, he has a heart that beats for Tris. His goal is to help her survive the new cutthroat world she has been thrust into, even if that means being her enemy from time to time. I liked finding out about Four in short bursts of emotion. His background and his true motives stay a mystery for a good chunk of the novel. Of course, this made him all the more interesting. Its the End of the World as We Know It... The concept behind Divergent is undeniably frightening and intriguing at the same time. In this dystopian world, war has been eradicated by simply cultivating the best virtues that any human being can poses. But in Divergent they have separated these traits into factions that live apart. The problem is, acting in accordance to one virtue does not guarantee a peaceful society. Eliminating peoples innate kindness or mercy to be brave or doing away with a conscious selfworth to be solely selfless leaves people open to attack on many fronts. What makes us human is the ability to experience all that life has to offer; to be brave when its necessary or honest when its appropriate. To focus on only one part of yourself can warp your ideals into something dangerous. That is whats happening in the world of Divergent. Factions are being corrupted. And if the one faction meant to protect you is unraveling, what do you do? Maybe, just maybe, Tris and her uniqueness will be able to fix what has taken place and find a way to triumph over the darkness in the world. I guess we shall see as the trilogy goes on. A Punch in the Gut... I was shocked by the direction this book took. We do not get a happy endingat least not yet. The initiation Tris goes through was nerveracking on its own, and then Roth decides to punch us in the gut by bringing the world down around our ears. It was a nice surprise because it only made me want to read book 2, Insurgent, even more. The plot was well structured, the pacing perfect, and the suspense was phenomenal. I was terrified for Tris most of the time. I felt her emotions as she struggled to become what her faction required. The fear of her fellow cruel initiates was a constant throughout the book. The betrayals against Tris hit me just as hard as her. The astronomical changes in her left me out of breath and craving more. Every multidimensional characterthe bad guys, the good guys, and the inbetweenerscontributed to this amazing story. Roths ability to write such outstanding fiction at her young age gives me hope as a young writer myself. The Bad The only thing that bugged me was when Tris forgave people that I think were unforgivable. There was some major backstabbing in the book, and no matter what happened to those people, I wouldve never forgiven them. But maybe Im just pigheaded. The Snuggly The romance is pretty minor. It takes quite some time for Tris and Four to get together. I like the fact that Tris is not very attractive but Four likes her because of her strength and determination. It gave their relationship a solid foundation because they grew to respect each other first. Id say the book is pretty clean except for some unwanted sexual touching. Overall I actually have Insurgent on the way to my house right now. I couldnt wait to read book2, and since it took me so long to read Divergent, I didnt have to wait but a couple of days. Roth did an amazing job of taking captivating characters and a kickass and compassionate heroine, throwing them into a terrifying world, and adding just enough political corruption, action, and drama to produce one hell of a read. This is not the kind of book you can pass up. Any adult or young adult out there will fall in love with Divergent. Its a must read! Excerpt I hear the crash of water against rocks. We are near the chasmwe must be above it, given the volume of the sound. I press my lips together to keep from screaming. If we are above the chasm, I know what they intend to do to me. Lift her up, cmon. I thrash, and their rough skin grates against mine, but I know its useless. I scream too, knowing that no one can hear me here. I will survive until tomorrow, I will. The hands push me around and up and slam my spine into something hard and cold. Judging by its width and curvature, it is a metal railing. It is the metal railing, the one that overlooks the chasm. My breaths wheeze and mist touches the back of my neck. The hands force my back to arch over the railing. My feet leave the ground, and my attackers are the only thing keeping me from falling into the water.
This review and others can be seen in all its proper formatting glory on my blog Beauty and the Bookshelf. Possibly 3.5 stars. I was eager to read Saint Anything since I first heard about it solely for the fact that its a new Sarah Dessen novel. My love for Sarah Dessens novels began when I was a freshman in high school and I read This Lullaby my second favorite novel of hers, with the first being Along for the Ride, and since then I have read all of her books except for The Moon and More, which I have yet to finish. I dont love all her books, and I prefer the ones that have more romance over the ones that dont. Could you imagine a Sarah Dessen novel that was solely focused on romance?! I WANT ONE. That said, Sarah Dessen is one of my favorite authors. And when you have a favorite author, you have this expectation and hope when you read one of their books: that youll love it. You either will or you wont, and for Saint Anything, well... Sydney Stanford has sort of lived in the shadow of her bad boy brother, whos currently in jail after he did something horrible while driving drunk spoiler alert: he hits a kid and puts him in a wheelchair for life. Despite the fact that her brother Peytons been on a train just waiting to wreck, her parentsnamely, her motherseem relatively shocked that Peyton is in jail. While Sydney avoids his phone callsthey have nothing to say to each other, and he wont let her come visitshe tries to accumulate to her new public school, where she transferred to from her swanky private one after her brothers accident and sentence. Its there that she meets new friends and gets to escape from home, where her dads always working, her mother acts like nothing bad happened and Peyton is essentially innocent, and Sydney tries to stay a million feet away from Peytons creepy friend Ames. Saint Anything felt like a Sarah Dessen novel, yet it didnt. Ive seen some reviews and blurbs calling it one of her darker novels, and while it has some darkness which Ill go into later, I wouldnt call it dark, especially when her other books have dealt with dark subjects like drugs, rape, and domestic abuse and violence. But Saint Anything had this aspectthis sort of thrilling, tense, suspenseful aspect created by one single character, and that aspect kept the pages turning as you tried to figure out what this character wanted, what the hell they would do, and how far Dessen might go. That was a new thing, I think, that Ive seen from Dessen though I havent read most of her books for years. And there was definitely a lot of elements here that scream Dessen: family issues, hints of romance, friendship, cameos and known references i.e. Spinnerbait, Anger Management, a certain character who makes coffee..., and just the writing you read and you know its a Sarah Dessen book. And yet, there was something else about this book, and I cant quite put my finger on it. I liked this book. I really, really did, definitely more so than not. Probably four stars. But I didnt love it. It has a major pageturner quality and I read it in like a day, which is always a good sign. And its higher up on my list of Dessen favorites, too. I did have a few issues with it, though, although theyre more like personal preferences. Scenes would end before I wanted them to, leaving me wanting more. The second chapter was a big info dump and I felt like I didnt really understand what was going and what Peyton had doneand I felt like I was missing other little bits, too, throughout. And the ending was good, but again, I wanted more. I always want more when a Sarah Dessen book ends. Really, I think that last bit is more of a thing with contemporary novels. Their endings never seem to fully satisfy and wrap things up how I want them, and I always want more. For, say, fantasy novels, a big part of the story might be the world, because the world isnt a world we know or live in. So when the book or series wraps up, it typically does so in a way that gives all the answers and satisfies the reader. Because in fantasy worlds, you cant just end the story by saying the world went on, because we dont have any idea what that looks like unless the book tells us. But in contemporaries, the world is our world, so we know how it goes on, and we dont need all the answers and a nice little bow wrapped around The End. So, in the end, I want more. Sorry for the little tangent. As for the story itself, it had similarities to My Life Next Door, but not in a bad way. This was mainly because of the Chathams, a family Sydney meets and spends time with and falls for especially a certain pizza delivery boy, and she also finds a good best friend. The Chathams own a pizza place, where Dad, Mac, and Layla Chatham work. They also have an older sister whos trying to get back into ice skating, and a mother with ALS. For Sydney, the Chathams are like her family away from her family, and I really liked them. I was also a fan of the group of friends she made at school, and all their little dynamics. I really love groups like that in books and movies. Sydney herself was a likable character who learns to get a bit of a backbone and branch out somewhat, and I enjoyed her story, even if it wasnt a fluffy sort of story. I would have liked to see more about her brother, and her parents were, well...kind of ugh. And dont even get me started on Ames. Saint Anything is an interesting novel with compelling aspects and pizza, music, and YumYums like Dum Dums. Its strong points were its romance, characters, pageturning and engrossing quality, and points of tension and suspense, while it fell just a little bit short in leaving me wanting more. Its certainly a good novel, and one that I liked, and as far as Sarah Dessen novels go, Id peg this toward the middle in the terms of how good it is. But its an interesting one, this one. Yeah, its interesting. Something new and out of the box from Dessen is nice, though. But seriously, I want a romancebased novel, STAT. And Im still a big Sarah Dessen fan, forever and always. I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review, and that in no way sways my opinion of the book.
Not that this really needs to be said anyways because you can already see this above, but The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most solid fivestar ratings Ive ever given in my whole Goodreads career. And this review will be spoilery so if you dont want to know dont go past this point. And, again, my stupid computer shut down on me while I was writing this so now I have to rewrite this all again. Sigh. I got this book totally on coincidence. I was just browsing through Barnes and Noble, not really planning on buying anything, when I came upon three full shelves of The Fault in Our Stars. Even then, I wasnt really planning on buying it shame on me I know what was I even thinking but then I saw that one lone book on the shelf had a bright yellow sticker on it saying, signed by John Green! I opened the book to the front page and saw his signature in green ink. Enjoying the irony, I picked it up and decided to buy it; clutching it to my chest and carrying it up to the counter. And let me say that was one of the best literary decisions of my life. This is how I feel about this book in gif form, just let me tell you: Seriously; Im going to put it in a glass case on top of a red velvet pillow and honor it for all my days I dont really know what else to say besides that this book was amazing. Absolutely incredible. And, personally, I think it was because how close I am to death. My dad died when I was 15 of a sudden heart attack  Here is my review for a book called A Monster Calls that you should also read where I go more indepth about it, for those of you who didnt know, and so many things that Hazel and Augustus went through were reflected in me. The absolute hate she had for people who smoked; wasting perfectly good lungs when she basically had none is my distaste for people who dont take care of their hearts when one visit to a doctors office and a couple of small pills would save their life. When Augustus broke down and admitting that everything wasnt alright; that this wasnt fair, is something that Im still going through in my own life. When they held Augustus funeral in the bottom of the church and had a heartwrenching, grosssobbing, twistyourfaceintothemostdisgustingangelsandfeellikeyourowninsidesaretearingyouapartwhileyouscream mourning was the same thing I went through with my own friends a couple days after he died. And, like Hazel, that was more of my own person funeral for my father than his real one ever was. All of the facebook posts of people who didnt know Hazels Augusts just like they didnt know my father. When they both went to Germany and found out even the person you hold in the highest esteem, is practically untouchable by bad, turns out to disappoint you. The act of doing absolutely nothing important with a person that means everything. The Fault in Our Stars hit me at every emotional angle possible. Props to you, Green. And just the characters by themselves are just so unique and special in their own right, and it was a really tight tie between Hazel and Augustus as my favorite I mean come on that letter he wrote about her at the end ripped my heart out and spread it to the four corners of the earth, never to be seen again., but Hazel still won out just because of who she is. You knew who she was and what she stood for the minute you read her first paragraph in the book, and still kept her core beliefs throughout the novel, even though her perception did change, but whose wouldnt after meeting the man that is Augustus? I loved absolutely every single facet of her. She was the steady rock that guided me through Greens book. And this is all I have to say to her: And Augustus. Oh my baby Augustus. He is everything I never knew I wanted in a male character and more. He also gives a big thankyou from me for everything he did for me and for Hazel, and he was the storm that ruffled her life because, although she was a rock, she was too much of a rock, and he lifted her up so she could reach her full potential and not just keep sinking into the ground from her own weight. They were both just right for each other. And that letter that he wrote at the end had me going: But then I wanted it all at the same time. It was all too much for me. And the fact that they had sex? Just ugh. Thank you for that, John Green. And speaking of that man, his writing alone was like literary porn in a way that I couldnt stop reading it. Heres the first paragraphs: Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death. Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really. But my mom should be adjusted and also I should attend a weekly Support Group. This Support Group featured a rotating cast of characters in various states of tumordriven unwellness. Why did the cast rotate? A side effect of dying. The Support Group, of course, was depressing as hell. It met every Wednesday in the basement of a stonewalled Episcopal church shaped like a cross. We all sat in a circle right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would have met, where the heart of Jesus would have been. I noticed this because Patrick, the Support Group Leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked about the heart of Jesus every freaking meeting, all about how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in Christs very sacred heart and whatever. So heres how it went in Gods heart: The six or seven or ten of us walked wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didnt die and now here he is, a fullgrown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way slowly working his way toward a masters degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life. AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY! Justjust let me hug you, John Green. And the plot is enjoyable, simple, but complex enough that youre still not exactly sure where its going, but that actually excites you. You want it just the way it is. I would not change a single word of the whole book. And, okay, did anyone else think that it was just going to end abruptly like the book inside the book did? Because I sure as hell thought so, and although I still love the ending and would never change it, I was almost disappointed that didnt happen somehow. I cant be the only one that was thinking that, can I? Anyway, this was an incredible book, as per usual for our John Green, and I will treasure if for years to come I wasnt joking about putting it in a glass case, people. And I suppose I will see you all at the next book that makes me cry, an event I look forward to and dread.
Cress by Marissa Meyer is the third in the Lunar Chronicles. If you havent heard of this series, be sure to check out my reviews of the first book, Cinder, and the second book, Scarlet, because this series is freaking fantabulous! I felt that Scarlet was even better than Cinder, and Cress does not disappoint this trend. While Cress was a slightly different book than the first two, it made my brain feel all warm and fuzzy every time I sat down to read. We meet new characters and get to know old ones better, there is epicness on so many levels, and I am EVEN MORE excited about the fourth book, Winter, than I was before! Note: A friend gave me an ARC of Cress to review. Some things may change in the final version. Cress by Marissa Meyer ARC 4.5 Stars Cress by Marissa Meyer Lunar Chronicles 3 Published by Feiwel  Friends on February 4th, 2014 Genres: Fairytale Retelling, Scifi, YA Length: 560 pages How I got my copy: Borrowed IndieBound  Book Depository  Goodreads Purchases made support this blog Rapunzels tower is a satellite. She cant let down her hairor her guard. In this third book in the bestselling Lunar Chronicles series, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, theyre plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army. Their best hope lies with Cress, who has been trapped on a satellite since childhood with only her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hackerunfortunately, shes just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice. When a daring rescue goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a high price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing stop her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only ones who can. Strengths: I feel that I must start with the title character: Cress! squeals I love her so much! I imagine that many of us are going to have Tangled flashbacks while reading Cress but I honestly think it totally works. Cinder and Scarlet are both kickbutt heroines, but Cress brings something new to the table. She has obviously led a pretty sheltered life with a skewed perspective on things mostly from watching net dramas.... and Meyer captures this wonderfully. Cress is a brilliant hacker but also adorably naive about a lot of things. She is a perfect edition to our fairy tale cast specifically because she isnt the typical kickbutt heroine who is too tough to cry! Omg yall, the twists! You know I love a good plot twist and I consider Cress to have more than one. They were the great kind, too, where they are kinda stressful because you know the characters lives are going to get more difficult, but also make perfect sense, but also just make you have to know what is going to happen! My pulse is rising just thinking about them .. The feels, wow, the feels. Scarlet definitely destroyed my emotions, but Cress doesnt pull any punches. They are made all the worse because you kind of know something has to happen, but its still so freaking emotional. There arent just sad feels though! Thorne and Cress had me squeeing and literally laughing out loud quite often ;. I love clever epic battles! You know when the hero saves the day against impossible odds not through luck or magically discovering some deep inner power but through being so dang clever?? That! That is awesome and that is what you get in Cress. We get little torturous hints about the character Winter and I am so freaking excited! Even though this is Cress, I am already impressed with how multifaceted Winter the character is going to be, not to mention the epicness of Winter the books plot.... Iko gets a couple of chapters from her perspective 3! Weaknesses: There are three couples now for those playing along at home and that is two more than most stories that we are used to have. All of the characters work great yey epic fantasy adventuring party!, but each of the romance pairings being so neat and tidy is a little annoying. I want a single fairytale princess, who needs boys?! Cress melted my heart, but I didnt get the whiteknuckle, edgeofyourseat feel that I had with Scarlet. I hit a point with Scarlet where I was literally getting white knuckles gripping the hardcover, and that just didnt happen with Cress which is probably good since it was a rather floppy ARC. I have very high hopes for Winter though ;. Summary: Really, at this point, you probably already know if you are going to read Cress or not. If you loved Scarlet, you will love Cress and Im so excited and a little jealous that you get to read it for the first time still :D. If you read Cinder and were only meh and not sure about continuing the series, continue the series! I cannot emphasize enough how much each books writing has grown and I love it. Im very impressed by how skillfully Meyer has weaved together three four in the end fairytale retellings, keeping each of the couples involved in the overarching storyline, and building this amazing scifi world to boot. Amazeballs if you ask me.
The tale of how my father lost his sister was as familiar to me as the stories my mother had told me of the Prophet, tales I would learn again later when my parents would enroll me in Sunday school at a mosque in Hayward. Still, despite the familiarity, each night I asked to hear PariaEURtms story again, caught in the pull of its gravity. Maybe it was simply because we shared a name. Maybe that was why I sensed a connection between us, dim, enfolded in mystery, real nonetheless. But it was more than that. I felt touched by her, like I too had been marked by what had happened to her. We were interlocked, I sensed, through some unseen order in ways I couldnaEURtmt wholly understand, linked beyond our names, beyond familial ties, as if, together, we completed a puzzle. I felt certain that if I listened closely enough to her story, I would discover something revealed about myself. In the opening chapter of And the Mountains Echoed, a poor father tells his children a story. A monster ravished a town until a child was offered to appease him. In order to save the rest of his family and the town, a father sacrifices his favorite child to the monster. Years later, unable to recover from the sorrow of this decision, the father scales a mountain to reach the monsteraEURtms fortress, seeking to bring his son home. But, finding that the boy is happy, wellfed, clothed and educated, he reconsiders. In this story is the core of the tales to come. Hosseini writes of the bond between parents and children, and the sacrifices some parents make to see that their children are well looked after. Does the benefit of a more comfortable home, a richer material upbringing, outweigh the loss of that natural parentchild experience? The theme of parenting, with complications well beyond the keeporsendaway element, permeates. The son of a wealthy local bigshot comes to realize that his comforts come at the expense of others. A massively scarred girl is left by her mother in the care of someone who is probably better suited to raise her. A young woman sacrifices years of her life to take care of an ailing parent. A warravaged child is taken in by one of her caregivers. I am forever drawn to family as a recurring central theme of my writing. My earlier novels were at heart tales of fatherhood and motherhood. My new novel is a multigenerational family story as well, this time revolving around brothers and sisters, and the ways in which they love, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for each other.There are sibling issues galore here. An ugly duckling twin gets revenge on the favored twin, but takes on a considerable burden. A brother and sister who were very close, are torn apart at an early age, and must cope with the absence, of that missing other part of themselves. Friendships that seem more like siblinghood sprout like poppies in Helmand. A Greek boy is joined by the daughter of his motheraEURtms best friend. She remains longer than expected. A fast, but fragile friendship forms between a rich boy in Afghanistan and the son of a poor man. The cast here is international, as is the selection of settings. Hosseini was born in Kabul, but, as his father was an ambassador, he was exposed to the wider world. Dad was posted in Paris when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. HosseiniaEURtms time in France informs the parts of the book that are set there. Eventually his family immigrated to the USA, taking up residence in California, another site in the novel. He has visited his homeland since growing up in the West, like AcmigrAcs we meet in these pages. One Afghani emigrant struggles with the tension between remaining connected to his homeland, in a very concrete way, or maintaining his separation. How much responsibility for dealing with AfghanistanaEURtms problems lies with those who have moved away? Hosseini, bestselling author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns returns us to a world, or rather worlds that we have seen before, a harsh Afghanistan as the emotional and tablesetting core, and western locales in which are echoed the events of the old world.aEURwhen you grow up in a Third World country, you know, poverty and affluence are juxtaposed. Its literally next door  you dont have to go to another zip code. Its right there when you walk out in the street, and there are beggars and so on and so forth. So it becomes part of your life, and you can either not, just not reflect on it, but I must have, because I remember my stories always had to do with these things. There was always some guy who came from a very affluent background and some person who came from a much less privileged background, and their lives collided in some way, and tragedy would ensue inevitably. I mean, sort of a recurring theme in my stories One of the points Hosseini makes here is the commonality of East and West, despite outward differences. He mirrors many of his charactersaEURtm experiences. People sacrifice themselves to care for those in need of help in both places. Parents are no less stressed in the West than in the East in terms of struggling with decisions about their children. Pain is too much for some in both worlds. In both worlds there are characters who cannot face their futures and opt out. In both worlds young people sacrifice themselves to care for others. In both worlds there are characters who are seriously damaged physically and must cope with adapting to worlds that value beauty or at the very least normalcy. In both worlds parents give up their children. We really are the same beneath our cultures and histories. I do not have a comparative character count here, but it was my sense that this was a larger book than his first two. Each of those focused mostly on a smaller group of actors. This time it seemed there was more of an ensemble cast, in multiple stories. The links between some of the elements were a bit tenuous, as if a short story that was lying around was modified enough to serve a purpose in this larger tale and inserted. It is a large landscape and I felt that on occasion we wandered too long away from some of the primary characters, maybe lost some parts of their lives. To compensate for this, when we get back to them, we are offered a readeraEURtms digest condensed report of what has happened since last we checked in. This created a bit of distance. That said, there is vast world of feeling here. Not only the agony of parents who feel they must give up their children, but the pain of other sundered familial connections as well. There are deep scars of guilt for terrible acts, and the pain of love denied. There is also joy in finding a kind of love where hope was slight, in reconnecting with those long lost, with saving and being saved. The echoes in the mountains are the sounds of tears, of both anguish and joy, universal, penetrating, human. Listen.

Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales Quick  Dirty: One of the best young adult paranormal series I have read. Opening Sentence: Youve got to be kidding me, the bouncer said. Folding his arms across his massive chest. The Review: Clary Fray is just your average teenage girl living in the city of New York with her mother. She has been best friends with nerdy Simon Lewis since first grade and they do pretty much everything together. One night Clary drags Simon to the Pandemonium Club in the city and her life is changed forever. Clary witnesses three strangely marked teenagers committing a murder, and the weird thing is that she is the only one that seems to be able to see them. Then the body just magically disappears and so theres no way Clary can report the crime or was it even a crime at all? This is Clarys first encounter with the Shadowhunters and the gorgeous infuriating Jace Wayland. Shadowhunters are taught from a young age to fight and kill demons. They use special ruins to protect and hide from the human eye and the fact that Clary can see them is very unusual. Soon Clarys world turns upside down, her mother is kidnapped and she herself is attacked by a demon. It turns out that her ties to the Shadowhunters world goes back further then she could have ever imagined. I completely adore Clary, she is a girl that fights for what she wants and isnt afraid to speak her mind. Her mother was a great artist and Clary has inherited her artistic talent. She grew up as an ordinary girl so when she was thrown into this new world it is a big adjustment, but she never complains. I love that she just takes everything in stride and tries to help in any way that she can. She has a fiery attitude to match her red hair, but she is also a very sweet and caring person. She is such a well rounded character that was easy to like and admire. If you like a kick butt heroine with an attitude you will love Clary Fray. Simon Lewis has been best friends with Clary since they were little kids, but Simon has always felt more for Clary than friendship. He is shy and unsure how she feels about him so he has never tried to make a move. Unfortunately for Simon, Clary is totally oblivious of his feeling for her. Simon is just one of those guys that is a genuinely good person, he will do anything for those he cares about. He is just a really nice guy that you feel slightly bad for because of his situation. I really love Simon and wish I had a best friend just like him. Jace Wayland is the epitome of what a hot guy should be like. He has a killer body, an angellike face, and is a total jerk. Whats not to love? To be honest, I fell madly in love with Jace right off the bat. There is just something about him that makes you melt inside. He is cocky and knows that he is a total catch but he is also slightly broken inside. He feels like he has something to prove to everyone and he doesnt like to let people in. When he meets Clary, there is this instant chemistry between the two that continues to build throughout the story. Pretty much everything about Jace is perfect and he will forever be one of my all time favorite book boys. City of Bones is a fast paced novel brimming with suspense, action, and romance. I have read this book multiple times and each time is as good as the first time. There are really no words to describe how much I love this series and all of its characters. At times you are left breathless and cant believe that just happened and other times you are left giddy inside from the sweet moments. This story will cause you to feel a range of emotions good and bad, but it is totally worth it. Cassandra Clare is one of my all time favorite authors and I will gladly read anything she writes. Another plus to this book is that it will be equally enjoyed by both guys and girls. My husband has read this series and really enjoyed it. If you are a paranormal fan and you havent read this book, I honestly dont know what you are waiting for. You should go and pick it up today because it is one of the best series I have ever read. On a side note, I wanted to mention that when I was sent City of Bones from the publisher they also included The Official Illustrated Movie Companion, and the Shadowhunters Guide as well. I thought I would mention a few things about them. If you are big fan of the books or movie then these materials would be a great addition to your collection. The movie companion gives all of the details about filming the movie and how they cast the characters. The book also details what some of their inspiration was for certain scenes they shot, interviews from the cast, and many photos from the movie. I found the content interesting and very informative. The Shadowhunters Guide features photos, facts about the characters, and detailed information about the workings of the Shadowhunters, Downworlders, and demons. I do want to say that I did go see the movie in theaters when it was released and while it was in no way nearly as good as the book, I still thought it was pretty good. I am very excited for City of Ash to go to the big screen and I will be going opening weekend to see it. If you are a fan of learning more about the process of movie making or are just a huge fan of the series like me, I would recommend picking up these special edition books. Notable Scene: A shriek tore itself out of Clarys throat. She staggered backward, tripping, and fell, just as the creature lunged at her. She rolled to the side and it missed her by inches, sliding along the wood floor, its claws gouging deep grooves. A low growl bubbled from its throat. She scrambled to her feet and ran toward the hallway, but the thing was too fast for her. It sprang again, landing just above the door, where it hung like a gigantic malignant spider, staring down at her with its cluster of eyes. Its jaws opened slowly, showing a row of fanged teeth spilling greenish drool. A long black tongue flickered out between its jaws as it gurgled and hissed. To her horror Clary realized that the noises it was making were words. Girl, it hissed. Flesh. Blood. To eat, oh, to eat. FTC Advisory: Margaret K.

This book was an amazing roller coaster of emotion, action, romance and fantasy. I LOVED IT! And now, I need to control myself after that ending and to clear my emotions to write all the things I loved about this book :  This book was epic! Amazing! I love how magnificent and perfect this books are. I have been waiting for this book since I finished CoHF, and right now I dont know how Im going to survive until 2017. I was fangirling all the time. I couldnt stop reading since the first page of the book and since then I was in a roller coaster of emotions. First of all, I love that we get to see more of the Shadowhunters world and more about the Faerie Realm; and also how is the life in other Institutes. I love that Cassie writes in such a beautiful way that the action and the mystery keeps you reading and reading until you finish the book. I love to have love, drama, mystery, funny parts, action and adventure. This book is perfection. And obviously I loved to have TMI characters intervention. I missed them so much. And about the characters... I loved Emma: shes so brave and badass and so funny. I love how in dramatic and tense moments she is capable of making jokes. I love how fierce and fearless she is. Jules, what can I say about you? My feelings towards him are so complicated. I love him but theres a little part of me that is kind of afraid of him; but I love how caring and loving he is with his brothers and sisters, and his passion for painting. Then is Mark...and my god! I just love him too. I love him. I simply loved Christina and one of the things I loved about her was her bravery and her kind personality. She is loyal and kind; and simply love to read phrases in Spanish and to read about Mexico in the book. The Blackthorns are an amazing family: I love how Dru is obsessed with horror movies, how Ty and Livvy are the nerds in the Institute and know everything about computers and Tavvy is so adorable... When you love someone, they become a part of who you are. Theyre in everything you do. Theyre in the air you breathe and the water you drink and the blood in your veins. Their touch stays on your skin and their voice stays in your ears and their thoughts stay in your mind. You know their dreams because their nightmares pierce your heart and their good dreams are your dreams too. And you dont think theyre perfect, but you know their flaws, the deepdown truth of them, and the shadows of all their secrets, and they dont frighten you away; in fact you love them more for it, because you dont want perfect. You want them. I cannot wait for the next book. I simply cant. Theres so much drama and suspense going on in the book and, even tough I tried to read it slowly, I finished this too soon. And now, I must fangirl all over the book because i really need to express my feelings: WTF!? sorry for the expression but theres no other word to express what Im feeling What was that?! That freaking ending. I literally wanted to enter the book and scream at Emma. She says to Mark that they need to pretend to be dating and then Mark says Why pretend? and I was like.... WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? I ship Mark and Christina so hard since the beginning. I want them to be together, I dont want to see her with Perfect Diego but at the same time I want her to be with Diego. And i dont know why, but the only thing Im certain is that I ship Mark and Christina. I think that she can heal the part of him that is suffering and broken, and I want so bad to see Mark being happy. Is there a name for this ship? Because in my mind the ship name is kind of weird. And I want Emma and Jules to be together. I dont care what the Law says I want them together. And when I was shipping so hard Mark and Christina and you read the scene where he is kissing Keiran, I was shocked. What in the world? Is Cassie trying to kill me? Then, when Kieran sees Mark talking with Christina and the next day he appears with the Leader of the Wild Hunt and he is going to be punished, and Jules interferes and he takes the lashes but then Emma knocked him out with a rune and then she takes the lashes... That was one of the hardest scenes I have ever read. Because just before the Faeries appeared Mark was saying to Julian that he was his brother and that he loved him. And Jules and Emma had knwoledge of each others feelings ... So yeah, Cassie wants to kill me. Jules and Emma. That scene in the beach is like Whoa, it took Jace six books and Will three to have sex and Jules less than a book. And also, since im talking about them, when Jem told Emma of what might happen if two parabatai fall in love was shocking. I have might suspected something like that because when Jules is hurt by the arrow and Emma remember her life with Jules and saves him and the rune has this weird glow; but still is shocking. I want them to be together and I think they are going to find a way to be together without getting mad and destroying themselves in the process. I absolutely loved the scene in the Lottery when they are dancing and they can feel each others feelings and when Emma is breaking up with Julian and he says that he wont give up on her... My poor heart And my complicated towards Julian are that I love the kind and loving part of him but like someone said because right now I dont remember who said it, he was a fierce heart... I never in my life imagined that Malcom was going to be the villain. He seemed so kind and funny, and the way he treated the Blackthorns was really nice. I actually tough it was Diana, because she was so mysterious and she rarely appeared in the Institute. But it shocked me. And that he was trying to bring to life his love that died many years ago. I actually thought that someone was trying to rise a demon or bring to life Sebastian and I was like not again, please. But now Annabelle is alive and we dont know how she is and what might happen. Then, you are casually reading the book and then this appears: On your feet, Christopher Herondale. Weve been looking for you for a long time. OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! THE LOST HERONDALE IS FINALLY HERE! AND TESSA IS THERE! AND JEM TOO! AND THE LOST HERONDALE! Too many feelings. I loved many things about this book. I cant even recall all the things I love, because if I do, this will be a loooong review. So now, I have to wait until 2017 to read the second book. So yeah, I finally finished my fangirl episode and the other thing I can do, other than wait until 2017, is give this perfect book 5 stars :D
Second read: I originally read this again cuz I was getting so impatient waiting for Crooked Kingdom. I tried it out on audiobook this time around and I love it a lot!! It wasnt all perfect of course, but I thought it was so entertaining listening to so many narrators tell the story. My favourite narrators were probably from the ones for Nina and Kazs POVs but all of them were pretty great. As for the book itself, it was still just as great as when I read it the first time. Even though I read it already last month, I felt like I was reacting to certain scenes almost the exact same way as I did the first time around and it was just so amazing to go on that journey again! Now Im ready for Crooked Kingdom. GIVE IT TO MEEEEE. First read: So this one came out sort of a surprise for me but at the same time not really. It was one of those books that was extremely hyped everywhere I went and I avoided picking it up for months and months because of it. I knew that I would eventually have to pick it up though, because I really love books that are very character driven and thats the one big thing I kept hearing about this one. I kind of knew that I would like the book but the reason I put it off for so long was because I didnt want the hype to influence my opinion so much when I read it. Im really glad I finally got to read this. Leigh Bardugo basically thought of every single kind of great main character thats out there and just put them all together in one book, and it was amazing. I especially love how almost all of them knew each other prior to this story and had some sort of history together. It was very refreshing compared to the usual main character goes on this adventure during the story and meets all the other significant characters along the way structure that Ive been reading a lot of lately. For the most part, I didnt even really care about what the plot was because I just kept reading for these awesome characters. With that being said, the rest of this review Im just going to talk about each of the characters and what I loved about all of them. And possibly just fangirl about the ships in between them and all that so yea......if you dont like that kind of thing then stop reading right here XD So going from my most to least favourites technically, I have a 1st and 2nd fave that are 100 for sure my top faves and then afterwards everyone else is pretty much almost all equal but imma try my best: 1.Inej Right from the very first moment she appeared in the book, I knew I was going to love her. For some reason she reminded me of Esmeralda from the Disney adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, who is basically my favourite Disney character ever. She was like an old soul trapped in a 16 year old teenagers body at times, and I freaking loved that about her. I just loved her determination and strength. She was always very observant of what was going on around her, and I love how she was constantly reflecting on herself and what she truly wanted out of her life. When she knew what she had to do or what she wanted to do, she fought for it. Shes definitely going on my life of favourite female characters of all time. 2.Nina Well DUH of course my top faves are the girls! Nina was very different from Inej but also really amazing. I loved how sassy she was and how she just said what she wanted to say and did what she wanted to do. And just like Inej she was so SO strong. I love how she was always protective of the Grisha community and how a lot of her actions were for her people. She knew who she was and knew what she had to do. At the same time, I really loved seeing her search for that balance between what she needed to do for her people and what she wanted for herself. Many of the characters went through this in some way as well but Ninas POVs definitely explored that a lot more with the type of situation she was in. Many times, she always put others before herself and it just made her so so admirable. I just love the girls in this book ok?!?! 3.Kaz At this point its so hard for me to rank everyone else but at the moment Kaz is my favourite guy. Though I got to be honest.......for most of the book he really really scares me XD He scares me in how ruthless he can be and how hes so ahead of the game with his plans. I dont even think I can describe how much he fits his role as the leader of the crew. You honestly just have to read the book. It is proven again and again through his dialogue and his overall character that he is THE leader. At the same time, we got to see that he does have a vulnerable side to him that he constantly hides from everyone through flashbacks, and it really helped to show what made him the way he is in the present time. Like a lot of the others, he carries his own baggage but he just hides it a lot more than the others do. I also love how he sort of acts like an old soul like Inej in a way.....and imma save the rest for AFTER I talk about the other three before I start just gushing about my OTP......XD 4.Matthias Matthias was a very complicated character. He was very much stubborn and a bit confused throughout this book because of things that happened in the past, and I loved reading about his inner struggles and him trying to come up with his own conclusions about certain things. 5.Jesper THIS is where things are really foggy for me. The only reason why Jesper is one of the ones that is so low compared to the rest is because I always felt like there wasnt enough of him in this story. I wanted a lot more chapters in his POV. I loved his character though and how he was the main comic relief. He never failed to pull out some lines to make me laugh. Again though, I wanted more from him!! 6.Wylan Same thing goes over here with Wylan. It didnt help at all that there was no chapters in his POV, though I do kind of see why that never happened. We only really saw how he was mostly through Jespers POV, but from what Ive read I love him just as much as everyone else. Now........OTP time............. Lets be real: a bunch of my sticky note annotations were of my shipping feels. Mainly for Kaz and Inej. Dear. Lord. I rarely ever ship fictional couples so fast the very few I did ship right away include Chloe and Derek from The Darkest Powers trilogy and Vin and Elend from the Mistborn trilogy, but OK I SHIPPED KAZ AND INEJ RIGHT FROM THE MOMENT OF THEIR FIRST INTERACTION IN THIS BOOK. Their relationship between each other just progressed......so......slowly....................and I loved every single moment of it. They are my FAVE. o And I need to bring up Nina and Matthias too cuz YES I SHIP THEM TOO. Both of these couples are so different from each other and GAHHHH I LOVE THEM. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. So yup. Im SO excited for next month for Crooked Kingdom! Im SO glad I waited this long to read this cuz now I dont have to wait too long for the sequel! XD
You wouldnt think that a book told entirely through IMs, interviews, emails, surveillance footage summaries and random documents would work. But it does. Oh boy, does it work. The authors are geniuses and also pure evil. I started this book on New Years Eve night and couldnt stop reading until 5:00am. I figured I had to get some sleep, but man did I hate to go to bed. I hated it! Kady is my new favorite character ever. She is so bad ass. And she has pink hair, which I just find awesome. The book starts on a morning when she has broken up with her boyfriend Ezra. Later that day, their planet gets attacked by some company BeiTech and things get crazy. First, Kady is the one who comes to Ezras rescue. She is no damsel in distress, as she shows time and time and time again. They get put on different ships Kady on the Hypatia and Ezra on the Alexander when they escape their planet, but they continue to talk through email. Kady is a computer hacker and she can get EVERYWHERE. She also prefers to work alone according to her psychiatric profile, which made me love her even more because I am the same way. She becomes determined to find out all the secrets that the top officers are keeping from them. And because she has lost everyone she loves in the original attack, she is even more protective of Ezra. You deserve every star in the galaxy laid out at your feet and a thousand diamonds in your hair. You deserve someone wholl run with you as far as and as fast as you want to. Holding your hand, not holding you back. You deserve more than I could ever give you, Kady. But Ill give you everything I can if you still want me to. Despite the fact that they are broken up and despite the fact that we only know what they show us in emails, I fell in love with this couple. Kady is a bad ass and Ezra is charming and hilarious as hell. There is flirting and sarcasm and all this history. They hate each other, they love each other and meanwhile, they are trying so hard not to die. Ezra becomes a pilot and he is no slouch in the bad ass department either. He is a loyal friend and so incredibly brave. Yes, it seems like Kady and Ezras problems are very immature, but they are barely eighteen, people. Cut them some slack. Ezra sent her an email drawing of a rose that was made out of the words Im sorry. I will forgive him just about anything. And then there were the countdowns . . . every so often, you would get a countdown to how long until one of the BeiTech ships was supposed to intercept them and they were crazy nervewracking. Kady is on one ship and Ezra is on another and there is all this tension. Will they both survive? Will the BieTech ship destroy all of them? Argh, I was biting my nails. God, I just wanted them to survive long enough to see each other again SO BADLY. The world building in this book was AMAZING. How did the authors manage to paint such a vivid picture of the planets and the ship and space without having an actual narrative? I dont know how they do it because they are geniuses and I bow down to their expertise. Now, there was a lot of scientific language and some of it, I didnt really get. I also didnt understand the reason why their planet was attacked in the first place. At the end, they did kind of hint at the reason and I assume we will know more in the sequel. Despite those issues, I still found myself LOVING this book!! The conflict wasnt even coming from JUST BeiTech and their need to destroy the two ships. No, there is an airborne virus affecting some of the people who escaped the attacked planet and the AI on Alexander has gone mental and thinks it needs to destroy everyone. Or maybe he is trying to protect everyone? Who really knows? I mean, there is a lot going on. And to top it all off, the people in charge are keeping secrets from everyone, so you have no clue who you can trust. I know AIDAN the Alexanders AI is supposed to be all evil and stuff, but I still loved him. I really, really loved the pieces with his POV. He was just kind of cool and I get why he wanted to do the stuff he wanted to do. Yeah, maybe I am part robot because I found myself relating to the machine. Ha. I also felt kind of sorry for him because he had human thoughts and yet, he wasnt really alive. And the fight at the end?!? HOLY DHQASEYUQWTEU!!! Kady and Ezra had to fight the BeiTech ship, AIDAN and all the refugees suffering from the plague. Man, there was a lot of violence and a lot of bloodshed and the authors just completely ripped my heart out with the last hundred pages. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!! And yet, I was sad to keep going because I hated for it to end. When I did finish it, I felt like giving the book a huge hug because I loved it so, so, so much. After finishing it, I was just this roller coaster of emotion and I was so mad because I WANT THE SEQUEL!! Seriously, can I just go to sleep and wake up when the sequel is released? That would be great, thank you. This book is 1000 worth the hype! Is it too early to call this book my favorite of 2016?

To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels Mockingjay  no matter what the personal cost. My review courtesy of me: THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS  IF YOU HAVENT READ THE FIRST BOOKS IN THE SERIES DONT READ THIS REVIEW. I usually do not put spoilers in my review I think it might be a first... but I feel the need to give my opinion here and I want to do it without trying not to give things away, because I have a lot of opinions here. Lol. I really enjoyed this book. Just like the first two books in this series, I was drawn into Suzanne Collins world and had to keep reading to the very end. I will say that I am glad this series is on my read shelf and that I have finished the series, I wasnt sure how much more disaster and tragedy I could face. I felt exhausted when finished with this book. I mean, Katniss really goes through the ringer throughout this series and my heart breaks for her. The brutality of the government was not lost on me and I completely understood why the districts revolted. I thought that Katniss as a symbol of their hope to change things, to stop the government was beautiful. Those people needed someone and she fit the bill. But it cost her dearly. Katniss is a strong character and she did seem to grow a little weaker in this final book, but that was realistic. Who wouldnt grow weaker at everything that had been done to her? I understood her lapse in mental capacity even though I admit, it frustrated me. When Peeta was gone I kept thinking GO GET HIM! and WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? I would get upset because I had no clue what was happening to him and I knew it was bad. I just wanted him safe and I wanted her to fight like hell to get him back. Then he did come back. Can I just disclose, that I think Peeta had my heart from the very beginning of this series. The boy with the bread completely won me over. And I admit in the first book, I was thinking Gale might be the guy for Katniss because of the way she would picture him while she was in the games and how his memory gave her strength to keep going. And at first, Peeta seemed kind of weak to me, like he was accepting that he was going to die. But then something happened. Its like he grew up, he grew into this man who would do anything for Katniss because he loved her. He held that girl up when she didnt even know he was doing. He sacrificed himself over and over for her. He understood her, he chased away the nightmares... everything in him was so strong. And with that being said I want to say how in the world could she be with anyone other than Peeta? Yes, I liked Gale. He was great, strong, dependable and protective. But he wasnt Peeta. In my humble opinion two people that have lived through and experienced what Peeta and Katniss did together could only end up together. They alone would understand the horrors they lived through. I think a bond was forged between them, a bond that would be indestructible by anyone else. Gale never stood a chance the minute Katniss was made a tribute. And I think that Peeta and Katniss deserve whatever happiness they could find when all this ended because hadnt they earned it? If two people can find their way back to each other after all of that after the tracker jackers! then people need to get the hell out of the way and let them live their lives. Which, in essence is exactly what happened. Peronsally, I think that if Katniss had ended up with Gale it would have taken away from the series and what they went through. As I said earlier, I did get frustrated by the long periods in the book where Katniss was kind of out of it even though I understood it and I was even more so frustrated by what was happening to Peeta. But really, I understood the need for all of it because you cant just come back from war and be okay. I was also saddened by the death of Primm. What a waste of a beautiful life. Course all the lives lost were such a waste. I was beyond upset when Finn died as well though I expected it and when we find out his wife Annie had their baby I was saddened further because that child wouldnt know its father. It would be robbed of what it could have and should have had. It was beyond saddening. So you can see why I was relieved when I had the series read, I was tired. I needed a break from the sadness and despair. I will say that the ending made it a little bit better because Peeta and Katniss do find their way back to one another. All in all, this is a beautifully written series that I think everyone should experience. This book isnt about a love triangle. Its about survival. I am anticipating the movies to this series now and I hope that it does them justice. So there you have it. My opinion.
Actual rating: 3.5 I guess there was a war going on somewhere in the world that night but it wasnt one that could touch us. Recommended with some reservations. I read this book on accident. By accident, I dont mean I mistakenly read a book instead when I thought I had been playing Plants vs. Zombies 2 Im not that stupid, I meant that I picked up this book thinking the story would be something else. During World War II in England, there was an operation to evacuate children from the larger cities to more rural areas of England to keep them safe from possible airstrikes from the Axis forces. This has been the basis of some stories Ive enjoyed, most notably in the Narnia series, and the Noel Streatfield novel When the Sirens Wailed. Ive also watched my fair share of TV episodes based on this premise, so that is the reason why I started reading this book. I thought this was going to be a book based on a WWII evacuation. I clearly didnt read the word MANHATTAN in the freaking first sentence of the summary, nor did I see the SCIFI tag, because I sometimes have an annoying tendency to read only what I want to see. Still, the premise is an interesting one, so I continued with the book. It didnt sound so bad at all, really, quite solidly in my forte when I think about it. A war, survival, love, maturity...all up my forte. Cousinly love? Whatever, Ive got no problems with that in fiction, as long as its believably built. Hell, Ive read my fair share of worst incestuous relationships. This book just might turn out awesomely after all, despite not being what I initially signed up for. This was a short book, but within the first 25 pages, I was sure I would give this book a 2. Things improved, but it took a good 50 of the book for me to begin enjoying it. The problem is the narrator, Elizabeth known throughout this book as Daisy. She is a 15 year old originally from Manhattan, and my first impression of her was not good. She was a little bitch. I hated her for most of the book. Her narrative was what gave me so much trouble; she is so selfish, so selfcentered, so utterly selfabsorbed. I didnt like her, I didnt trust her, and to me, she was an unreliable narrator because her view of the world is so skewed...as in completely focused upon ME ME ME. No matter how much you put on a sad expression and talked about how awful it was that all those people were killed and what about democracy and the Future of Our Great Nation the fact that none of us kids said out loud was that WE DIDNT REALLY CARE. Most of the people who got killed were either old like our parents so theyd had good lives already, or people who worked in banks and were pretty boring anyway, or other people we didnt know.Daisy is spoiled and a pain in the ass. Her mother died giving birth to her, and in essence, Daisy thinks of herself as a murderer, having killed someone as she draws her first breath. Her father remarried a woman named Davina...and Jesus, how Daisy hates Davina. ...Davina the Diabolical, who sucked my fathers soul out through his you know what and then got herself knocked up with the devils spawn which, when it pops out, Leah and I are going to call Damian even if its a girl.Her pettiness and attitude towards her mother is not uncommon, but Daisys hatred is so spiteful and bitter and over the top that I cant help but hate her for it. Daisy yammers on for a considerable amount of time about how she hates Davina...but its never made completely clear WHY we should hate Davina so much besides for the very fact that she happened to be the woman who married her father. Oh, and apparently Daisys got an eating disorder. How did she become this way? I really tried to explain about at first not wanting to get poisoned by my stepmother and how much it annoyed her and how after a while I discovered I liked the feeling of being hungry and the fact that it drove everyone stark raving mad and cost my father a fortune in shrinks and also it was something I was good at.Yeah...shes not the most likeable character. Her firstperson narrative style also drove me crazy. The story is written almost from a stream of consciousness style, and it really annoyed me. Added to my dislike of the main character, and I was not a happy reader for the first half of the book. I just wanted to yell at Daisy What? Are you too fucking good to use quotation marks for speech like everyone else? Little bitch. I seriously hated Daisy. She is a really, really selfcentered narrator. There is a war going on, she doesnt seem to care. Daisy seems more concerned about her own problems and her womp womp sad poorlittlerichgirl life than anyone else around her, even when a bomb goes off in London and the world descends into chaos. For the first half of the book, her descriptions of the war and its devastation are described coldly, impersonally, there is no sense of danger, of mortality, of impending doom. Daisy is so detached from it all, in her own egotistical little mind. That was a bomb that went off in the middle of a big train station in London the day after Aunt Penn went to Oslo and something like seven or seventy thousand people got killed. This obviously went over very badly with the populace at large and was pretty scary etc. but to be honest it didnt seem to have that much to do with us way off in the country.Everything from the war is described similarly in this impersonal, disinterested manner. It frustrated me to no ends. Daisy does grow up, she does mature...she does wake up from her ostrichinthesand status when things literally hit close to home, and her character grows in complexity, although so gradually that I hardly noticed it happening myself. I actually enjoyed the subtlety of her character development. I did not like the other characters in this book. I didnt feel like anyone else besides Daisy had a personality besides herself, most likely because Daisys personality is so obnoxious that it overpowers everything surrounding it. Piper is the perfect princess, Isaac is the autistic twin, Osbert is the pompous prick of an older brother, Edmond is the clutches pearl cousinly love interest...and he is just dull. I have nothing against incest in fiction, I really dont. Cousincousin relationships are even less shocking, but there is a way of building up these sorts of relationships to make them believable and I just did not buy the concept of Daisy  Edmond in this book. Edmond is just...weird. Hes a short little 14year old who was smoking a cigarette when they first met, and he seems to be able to read Daisys mind. Edmond was such a creepy character for me, and their interactions were so limited so that when they began a physical relationship, I was utterly astounded at how fast and how wrong it felt. Its not the nature of the cousincousin relationship that bothers me, its the implausibility of it. My favorite part about the bookwhen it FINALLY camewas the survival aspect. Without the knowledge that this book is set in presenttime, this book could easily have been set in the 1940s, there is a timelessness in how it feels, but thats perhaps intrinsic in a story of this nature. Working for the war effort, struggling to find resources, banding together to help one another, facing the immediate danger from home, as well as from the enemy. All these, I reveled in. The latter half of the book was far superior to the first even if I was disappointed by the book overall.
Originally published at Reading Reality The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was recommended to me in glowing terms by multiple people the year that it was published. And being in a contrary mood, I didnt read it at the time. Im here to say that everyone who told me to READ THIS BOOK was absolutely right, and I was wrong to wait. This thing is awesome on so many levels. Its a medical mystery. It provides some serious context for discussions of medical privacy, including those HIPAA forms we all sign every time we get medical treatment these days. It dives deeply into the field of medical ethics. It makes you think about fairness and justice. It provides a fascinating and humanized history lesson in cell research. And the description of cervical cancer treatment in 1951 is scarier than any horror movie ever made. Its not that Henrietta Lacks was treated badly at that point, its that the treatment in general seems absolutely barbaric from early 21st century perspectives. The standard treatment was to insert tubes of radium into her cervix and sew them in place for TWO DAYS. If you are a woman and this doesnt make you reflexively clench your legs shut, you are a much braver woman than I. The description of this treatment makes Torquemada look benevolent. But this was the state of cancer treatment in 1951. However, the story of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks both is and isnt about Henrietta herself. Because Henrietta died in 1951. Her cancer killed her. But not before her doctor removed bits of both her tumor and her healthy organs and turned them over to the nascent science of cell research. Cell science was nascent because of one major problem, the researchers couldnt manage to keep a cell line alive for more than a few days. The bits of Henrietta that her doctor sliced out without her permission did not obey the normal rules of harvested cells. Just as her tumors grew at an unprecedentedly rapid rate, so did her harvested and cultured cells. Henrietta Lacks died, but her harvested HeLa cells, thrived. At first only at Johns Hopkins, but eventually at biological research labs and companies all over the world. The cancer that killer her also made her immortal. Henrietta, through her HeLa cells, helped cure polio. And diagnose cancer, and create vaccines for HIV and HPV. And helped scientists to study the effects of travel in outer space on human cells. You name a medical breakthrough in the past 60 years, and HeLa cells are somewhere in the story, whether the actual cells, or the techniques that were created around them. HeLa has saved thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of lives. Those cells have also made hundreds of researchers and biological products companies either rich or famous, and sometimes both. But her family was not informed. Nor did they consent. In fact, when researchers needed better methods of distinguishing HeLa cells from other cultures, researchers took blood samples from her surviving family, without fully informing them of the purpose of the tests. And revealed their names and relationships to Henrietta in medical journals. All of this seems unthinkable today, but at the time it took place, it was all legal. It wasnt until the turn of the 21st century that a researcher chose to include Henriettas surviving family in research about Henrietta and her miraculous HeLa cells, but by providing the family with the scientific information and simple respect that they had been denied for so long, was able to both give them closure and create the first complete record of this formerly unsung woman who changed the face of medicine. Escape Rating A: This book is really two stories running in a kind of parallel. The first story is Henriettas story. Not just the biography of her actual life, but also a tracing of the history of her immortal medical afterlife. The continuing life and journey of her HeLa cells. Those cells helped to create a revolution in cell research, which in turn created a revolution in medicine. As with so many revolutionary ideas, those revolutions fed on themselves in either a vicious cycle or virtuous circle, depending on ones perspective. Once a line of viable cells, the HeLa line, came into existence, everything about cell research has spent decades playing catch up. All of the procedures for handling, transporting, culturing and eventually selling cells developed because there were finally cells to create procedures around. But even more importantly, the ongoing discussions in medical ethics, medical research and patient confidentiality are still catching up to the developments made possible by the myriad opportunities that were opened with the HeLa cells. Henrietta did not give permission for her cells to be harvested and used. The law did not require it. What will astonish you is that the law still doesnt. The story of the authors search for Henrietta and her family, and her work with them and for them over the years that this book was in development make for every bit as compelling a story as the story of the HeLa cells. As the years went by after Henriettas death, and as her cells were used around the world, there was a long period of time in the history where her name was obscured or deliberately covered up. Multiple names were put forward as the original HeLa, including Henrietta Lakes, or Helen Lawson, and most often, Helen Lane. Even as one reads the accounts, one gets the feeling that there was an attempt to hide the origin of the cells from the family. When the HeLa research began, the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment was still going on, and there was a persistent and not totally false rumor mill that African Americans were frequently kidnapped for experimental purposes and often experimented on without their consent or knowledge. The kidnappings may have been apocryphal, but the experiments so clearly were not. This was also the era of a kind of heroic medical researcher who thought nothing of injecting unsuspecting patients of all types including sometimes themselves with all manner of drugs and diseases without their consent. A study was conducted with HeLa cells, injecting HeLa cells, which were known to contain cancer, into healthy patients to see if they would develop cancer in turn. The patients were not informed because it might cause them anxiety. No kidding. And the great majority of the patients did develop tumors at the injection site which required surgery. At least one developed cancer. Just the thought of this kind of research brings back the spectre of Nazi medical experiments in the concentration camps. And it makes me shudder in reflexive horror. But as the real identity of the HeLa cell donor became more and more widely known, at least in medical circles, it also brought out of the woodwork more and more people who wanted to take advantage of the family in some way. By the time the author of this book began her quest, the family was angry at partial and incomplete explanations and disgusted by or frightened of the charlatans who knocked on their door. So part of the story that the author tells is of her journey to being trusted, and then the journey she undertakes with Henriettas surviving daughter to uncover the truth. The questions that are explored, and the answers that they find, stick in the mind and heart of the reader long after the last page is turned. Reviewers Note: The mother of a 15yearold boy attending a STEM Academy in Knoxville Tennessee has requested that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks be banned from the entire school district on the grounds that the book is pornographic. Her contention is based on two incidents in the book. Henrietta first diagnoses herself by inserting her own fingers into her vagina to find the lump on her cervix that she believed was present. Which it was. And the second support for the charge of pornography is that Henriettas medical records include her multiple diagnoses of syphilis and gonorrhea, and go on to explain that she contracted the venereal diseases from her husbands promiscuity. This is not pornography. This is history. And gynecology. Also a whole lot of courage on Henriettas part. How many of us would rather continue in ignorance than investigate inside our own bodies for ourselves?
Listen. This book is devastating. Devastating. If you, like me, have been told for a few years now that its the most important thing written about American society so far this century, and you nod, and say, yeah, Im sure, but still dont get around to reading it: Stop. Read it. Go get a copy now and start. This is the next book on your reading list. Michelle Alexander lays out with brutal clarity the efficiency and durability of the system of mass incarceration that has resulted in astonishing numbers of people being under the official control of the state. This massive collection of people has limited access to all of the things essential to survival: housing, employment, government benefits, education, and, lest they try to change any of the foregoing, voting rights. With statistics, anecdotes and details that will make your eyes bleed with fury, she reviews every aspect of the system, each of which functions along racial lines: perceptions of drug offenders, profiling by police, getting out on bail, access to representation, charges levied by the prosecutor, sentencing laws, and more. Chapter 3, in which Alexander discusses the legal dead ends that have been created by the Supreme Court from every possible angle, will make you speechless with anger. Look up City of Los Angeles v. Lyons for one example. All of this demonstrates the flexibility and endurance of white supremacy in America; not surprising given that it was the original foundation of our economic system. This ability of white supremacy to be creative and adaptive is best exemplified in Alexanders discussion of colorblindness. Colorblindess, or not seeing or considering race, is something most Americans consider a good thing, something to strive for in the wake of a Civil Rights Movement that was up against overt racial hostility. But that colorblindess is what enables the system of mass incarcerationwhere the state has been able to exert total deathgrip control over so many individual lives and whole communities to go largely unnoticed by liberals and libertarians alike. And even apparent signs of racial progress, such as a more diverse appearance to universities and corporate leadership, and even the astonishing fact of a Black president, contribute to this: the carefully engineered appearance of great racial progress strengthens the colorblind public consensus that personal and cultural traits, not structural arrangements, are largely responsible for the fact that the majority of young black men in urban areas across the United States are currently under the control of the criminal justice system or branded as felons for life....A widespread belief that a majority of black and brown men unfortunately belong in jail is completely compatible with the new American creed of colorblindness, provided that their imprisonment can be interpreted as their own fault. 234235 The gains of the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s and 70s were used to put mass incarceration in motion. The ashes of Jim Crow fertilized the soil for its offspring. A lot of this could be really discouraging and depressing. As Alexander points out, there are no easy fixes. There is no lawsuit that can overturn all this, no amount of police body cams that can uproot the caste system. Its so comprehensive and powerful. It is easy to feel hopeless and defeated contemplating it. BUT. She mentions throughout the book that the only real solution is a mass movement that is capable of transforming the public consensus. A mass movement that demands not only an end to racial bigotry, but forces us all to see African Americans as equally human and deserving of love and compassion and dignity. And those of us reading this in 2016 instead of 2010 get to read her prophecies and admonition with the knowledge that such a movement now exists. As she says in her final chapter, Those who believe that advocacy challenging mass incarceration can be successful without overturning the public consensus that gave rise to it are engaged in fanciful thinking, a form of denial. Isolated victories can be won  even a string of victories  but in the absence of a fundamental shift in public consciousness, the system as a whole will remain intact. THIS is why Black Lives Matter is one of the most important movements of our generation. This movement is doing it. With a complete lack of apology, and utter insistence on their agenda. Ive been crushing on BLM for a while, but Alexanders book has ratcheted that up to adoration. People. Those moments in history that are talked about 50 years later, that give us a new collection of street names and cultural references? Thats what were in right now. The presence of this movement transforms this book from being overwhelmingly discouraging to feeling injected with hope. Its happening. NOW. It is a new public consensus that will allow mass incarceration to die and stay dead. The final chapter of The New Jim Crow is the most challenging. Thats where Alexander makes it clear that the racial caste system cannot be changed without total structural overhaul. But the final chapter also made clear to me that we have to look beyond the end of racial caste as well. The powerful call for structural revolution in her final chapter points to another, equally fundamental structural barrier: the nature of our globalized, capitalistic economy. The fact of the matter is, our society now has an abundance of surplus humans. Between automation and outsourcing, American capital simply does not need as many people as it used to in order to thrive. Mass incarceration as a system of racial control would not have made sense 200 or 100 years ago, when Black labor was critical to powering the economic machine. And our current economic structure dictates that in order to live, you must be able to contribute to the production of material goods for consumption. It doesnt matter that we have produced all matter of material goods that are well beyond any persons reasonable definition of necessities. YOU MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THE INFINITE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL FOR THE OWNING CLASS. This is the condition upon which we are all permitted to live. So if we end up with more people than we need in order to accomplish that goal? Or if the role you could have played can instead be performed by a machine, or by a person in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico or Dhaka, Bangladesh? Your life is superfluous. Maybe we should be grateful we got mass incarceration instead of genocide. Capitalism has not hesitated to adopt such measures in the past. All of this underscores that our attempts to overthrow racial caste MUST BE paired with demands for a complete restructuring of our economic order. And that restructuring has to have a global vision. Like Alexander says, When the system of mass incarceration collapses and if history is any guide, it will, historians will undoubtedly look back and marvel that such an extraordinarily comprehensive system of racialized social control existed in the United States. 170 She is right that mass incarceration will end; our racial caste system has perpetually adapted itself to both loud cultural demands though not without a battle, and just as much to subtle economic demands usually as quietly as possible. But if mass incarceration ended tomorrow, we would have more people than our current economic system can absorb, and SOMETHING will be done to achieve the equilibrium capitalism depends upon for growth. The history of the United States makes it clear that that something will ALWAYS happen to African Americans first and foremost. So we must not only learn to show love, care, compassion, and concern across racial lines, as Alexander insists, but also create an economy where the vast majority of us will not be in a position of weakness and on the precipice of scarcity, a situation vulnerable to exploitation by the white elites to establish the next racial caste system and ensure their preeminence. I better stop myself there. I could go on way too long. Its that kind of a book.
Plot 810 Characters 8.510 Writing 8.510 World Building 7.510 TOTAL 8.110 Quickie Review Everyone that I knew told me amazing things about Angelfall. Therefore, I went into this book with incredibly high expectations. And even though it took me OVER A WEEK to finish reading it, I finished the book pretty satisfied. It was not, however, as amazing as many other people panned it out to be. Let me start by detailing one of the gripes I had. Fiction books are exactly what they are fiction. The ideas, characters, or worlds that are presented in fiction books are not real, and readers go into these books knowing this. Especially with dystopian and postapocalyptic books, readers are also expected to maintain a sort of suspension of disbelief. Dont think that the origins and causes of a certain world are realistic and plausible? Well, live with it. And up to this point in my reading experiences, I have never come upon any problems with doing so. Until now. Angelfall was one of the first books in recent memory where I had a very hard time believing the world building. Obviously, the premise of Angelfall is that angels have come to bring the apocalypse and that people will now be judged by God. Biblically speaking, thats fair. But I did not expect was to be taken into a world where angels are killing and kidnapping people in terribly brutal ways. And by brutal, I mean brutal. Just read the book, it gets extremely graphic and gory in parts. As a Christian, I had a pretty big problem with this. Effectively, Susan Ee was taking a wellestablished religion and messing around with it to create a book. Ee also introduced the idea that angels can die, but only by their own types of swords. In my world, angels CANNOT die, and if they could, it wouldnt be by their own type of sword. That sounds it came out of a video game or something. I considered putting this book down, because it went against everything that I had been taught as a kid. The Bible was being twisted and shaped into some kind of urban fantasy. Thats when I had to reassure myself that this was just a work of fiction. It wasnt real, and Ee did not write it with the intention of pissing off all of the Christians in the world. Besides, I read Harry Potter, which contains the idea of witchcraft, and I certainly enjoyed it. So AFTER I was able to get past the whole bad angels shtick, I was able to enjoy the book a lot more. The plotting was overall, pretty great. It started pretty slow; I didnt really get much action until page 75 or so, but from then, it was nonstop running and excitement. The climax at the end was really awesome and bonechillingly scary, which is ALWAYS a good thing. The ending was very good in that it offered a sense of closure but still left it open for a developing plot line. At first, I had my issues with the characters. Penryn was hard to connect to at first. Of course, her main goal was to find her sister and take her back, but that didnt really do much for me, because at the beginning, I didnt really understand how much Paige meant to her. So her goals and her motivations didnt move me as much as maybe they should have. For me to really get invested in a character, I need to fully back whatever heshe is trying to accomplish. And I couldnt quite do that in the beginning. But I did eventually come around, and I think Penryn is a very strong character. Raffe was another character that took a while for me. In the beginning he was distant, cold, and snarky: kind of hard to like. Also, I was struggling with what he was supposed to look like. As soon as I decided on an appearance in my head, and as soon as Raffe warmed up to Penryn as a person, I started to connect to him more. Perhaps the best thing about this book was the relationship between Penryn and Raffe. It was so beautifully done; it was built up incredibly gradually, very realistically, and in an emotional and moving way. At first they were only connected by their motivations, and then somewhere in the middle, it became a bit more than that, although Ee did a great job of keeping their relationship somewhat unclear and cloudy. The final scenes were incredibly touching. The romance isnt really even a romance for much of the book, as an angelhuman relationship is unheard of and unforgivable. But those final moments really makes you wonder if there really is something brewing in their relationship, and if so, how on Earth theyll make it work. In terms of side characters, I ALREADY dislike the politician, which is fine, because hes the villain. Penryns mom was kind of confusing she was loving, but also crazy. I must have missed the explanation for why she slices people up, because I still dont know. Also, her relationship with Penryn seems a bit strained at many times, Penryn considered her sister more important than her mother. Is it because her mother is crazy? Well, that shouldnt be a legit reason. Anyway, it will be interesting to see how she fits into the story as the series progresses. The writing was very good overall Ee did a good job of keeping the story moving and giving readers clear insight as to what Penryn was thinking all the time. The book was also peppered with moments of dry humour, which I appreciated as a contrast to all of the dark themes and plot developments. I also think Ee did a good job of blurring the lines of good and evil Penryn hates the angels, but cares for Raffe, which will undoubtedly lead to some kind of tension in the future. Overall, Angelfall was a satisfying read that, while it didnt live up to potential, still provided me with a fastpaced, emotional story to get invested in. While it took its time, and the beginning didnt necessarily hook me in, by the end, I was invested in the characters and their journeys. I cant wait to see what happens next.
This review was originally posted on Ticket to Anywhere Places Traveled To: Shady Creek, Georgia  Atlanta, Georgia First Lines: Its a weirdly subtle conversation. I almost didnt notice I was being blackmailed. Writing a review for a book that I adored are sometimes the hardest reviews that I have to write. Its so easy to pick out the things you didnt like about a story but when you love it so much that you simply want to crawl into its pages and live there forever? Not as easy to find the words. At least, words strung together in such a way that makes sense to those not living inside of my head. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli is one of those books where I feel all the feels and I may have already read it more than once even though I just finished it the other day. Its such a Mary Poppins story that is nearly perfect in every way and I just hated for it to end. Like for reals. My new mission in my bookish life is to pester Becky Albertalli over and over until she writes a companion story so that I can get more from this world and these characters. My love of Simon knows no bounds. I loved his voice and his POV and just everything about him. Hes real and down to earth and hell make your heart swoon. I love his relationships with those around him, his best friends and his family and best of all there is no pointless drama in this book!!! Oh the pointless drama is such a pet peeve of mine and its so refreshing to find a book that doesnt have that. Yes, there is conflict and issues but they arent over the top and they cant easily be solved by two people talking to each other. Because Simon and Blue talk all the time. At least, they do via email and they are so open and honest with each other. Oh how I loved those email exchanges and my only regret is that there werent more of them. Another thing I loved about Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda was the inclusion of parents within the story. Through Simon we learn about the various family units of his friends but who I loved most were Simons parents. They were much like mine in that they had jobs and they were involved in my life. I loved how they made a big deal out of everything because so often those small moments can be overlooked. I liked how when Simon messed up he faced consequences and when he was in a play at school they treated it as if he had the lead roll and not just a supporting part. They made me smile with every appearance on the page and I was just so happy to see a happy family unit. Too often in YA reads the parents are either dead, absent, or there but so selfabsorbed that they might as well not be there at all. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda also made my heart ache. I understood Blues reluctance to break through the wall of anonymity that the email exchanges gave him and Simon. To leave that safety and bring things to the real world. Especially in a smallish sized town where there arent many openly gay people its hard. Especially since the reality of a person can be so different than their onliner persona. But with every email exchange I kept hoping that in that one, that moment, Blue would be all for a meeting with Simon. It was for this moment that I kept flipping hurriedly through the pages as I was desperate to know who Blue was and where this story would go. And let me tell you, the ending of Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda, oh my stars, that ending was perfect. So very perfect. This whole book was perfection. Seriously. Which is not something that I think Ive ever said about a book before. Ever. Oh I am sure that there are flaws within its pages but Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda just hit all the right notes with me. It made me feel and when I hit that final page I sighed a happy sigh and hugged the book for all of the loveliness within its pages. It truly saddens me that I can never read this one again for the first time but I do know that it will be reread often and I will fall more in love with its story and its characters each and every time. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda is a book that you need to have on your radar. Its a book that I think everyone should read. If you only read one book this year than this is the book that it should be. This is something else that I dont say that often but I just feel so strongly about this book that I want to use all the cliches and all the words and all the everything I can in order to get YOU yes YOU!! to read this book. If I could buy everyone a copy of Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda I would but I cant. Its unputdownable and your life will be just a little bit better for having read it. P.S.A.: When you do pick up Simon vs the Homo Sapiens be sure to have a package of Oreos handy because this book will make you crave them. Add Something Real by Heather Demetrios to Goodreads.

This book was an amazing roller coaster of emotion, action, romance and fantasy. I LOVED IT! And now, I need to control myself after that ending and to clear my emotions to write all the things I loved about this book :  This book was epic! Amazing! I love how magnificent and perfect this books are. I have been waiting for this book since I finished CoHF, and right now I dont know how Im going to survive until 2017. I was fangirling all the time. I couldnt stop reading since the first page of the book and since then I was in a roller coaster of emotions. First of all, I love that we get to see more of the Shadowhunters world and more about the Faerie Realm; and also how is the life in other Institutes. I love that Cassie writes in such a beautiful way that the action and the mystery keeps you reading and reading until you finish the book. I love to have love, drama, mystery, funny parts, action and adventure. This book is perfection. And obviously I loved to have TMI characters intervention. I missed them so much. And about the characters... I loved Emma: shes so brave and badass and so funny. I love how in dramatic and tense moments she is capable of making jokes. I love how fierce and fearless she is. Jules, what can I say about you? My feelings towards him are so complicated. I love him but theres a little part of me that is kind of afraid of him; but I love how caring and loving he is with his brothers and sisters, and his passion for painting. Then is Mark...and my god! I just love him too. I love him. I simply loved Christina and one of the things I loved about her was her bravery and her kind personality. She is loyal and kind; and simply love to read phrases in Spanish and to read about Mexico in the book. The Blackthorns are an amazing family: I love how Dru is obsessed with horror movies, how Ty and Livvy are the nerds in the Institute and know everything about computers and Tavvy is so adorable... When you love someone, they become a part of who you are. Theyre in everything you do. Theyre in the air you breathe and the water you drink and the blood in your veins. Their touch stays on your skin and their voice stays in your ears and their thoughts stay in your mind. You know their dreams because their nightmares pierce your heart and their good dreams are your dreams too. And you dont think theyre perfect, but you know their flaws, the deepdown truth of them, and the shadows of all their secrets, and they dont frighten you away; in fact you love them more for it, because you dont want perfect. You want them. I cannot wait for the next book. I simply cant. Theres so much drama and suspense going on in the book and, even tough I tried to read it slowly, I finished this too soon. And now, I must fangirl all over the book because i really need to express my feelings: WTF!? sorry for the expression but theres no other word to express what Im feeling What was that?! That freaking ending. I literally wanted to enter the book and scream at Emma. She says to Mark that they need to pretend to be dating and then Mark says Why pretend? and I was like.... WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? I ship Mark and Christina so hard since the beginning. I want them to be together, I dont want to see her with Perfect Diego but at the same time I want her to be with Diego. And i dont know why, but the only thing Im certain is that I ship Mark and Christina. I think that she can heal the part of him that is suffering and broken, and I want so bad to see Mark being happy. Is there a name for this ship? Because in my mind the ship name is kind of weird. And I want Emma and Jules to be together. I dont care what the Law says I want them together. And when I was shipping so hard Mark and Christina and you read the scene where he is kissing Keiran, I was shocked. What in the world? Is Cassie trying to kill me? Then, when Kieran sees Mark talking with Christina and the next day he appears with the Leader of the Wild Hunt and he is going to be punished, and Jules interferes and he takes the lashes but then Emma knocked him out with a rune and then she takes the lashes... That was one of the hardest scenes I have ever read. Because just before the Faeries appeared Mark was saying to Julian that he was his brother and that he loved him. And Jules and Emma had knwoledge of each others feelings ... So yeah, Cassie wants to kill me. Jules and Emma. That scene in the beach is like Whoa, it took Jace six books and Will three to have sex and Jules less than a book. And also, since im talking about them, when Jem told Emma of what might happen if two parabatai fall in love was shocking. I have might suspected something like that because when Jules is hurt by the arrow and Emma remember her life with Jules and saves him and the rune has this weird glow; but still is shocking. I want them to be together and I think they are going to find a way to be together without getting mad and destroying themselves in the process. I absolutely loved the scene in the Lottery when they are dancing and they can feel each others feelings and when Emma is breaking up with Julian and he says that he wont give up on her... My poor heart And my complicated towards Julian are that I love the kind and loving part of him but like someone said because right now I dont remember who said it, he was a fierce heart... I never in my life imagined that Malcom was going to be the villain. He seemed so kind and funny, and the way he treated the Blackthorns was really nice. I actually tough it was Diana, because she was so mysterious and she rarely appeared in the Institute. But it shocked me. And that he was trying to bring to life his love that died many years ago. I actually thought that someone was trying to rise a demon or bring to life Sebastian and I was like not again, please. But now Annabelle is alive and we dont know how she is and what might happen. Then, you are casually reading the book and then this appears: On your feet, Christopher Herondale. Weve been looking for you for a long time. OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! THE LOST HERONDALE IS FINALLY HERE! AND TESSA IS THERE! AND JEM TOO! AND THE LOST HERONDALE! Too many feelings. I loved many things about this book. I cant even recall all the things I love, because if I do, this will be a loooong review. So now, I have to wait until 2017 to read the second book. So yeah, I finally finished my fangirl episode and the other thing I can do, other than wait until 2017, is give this perfect book 5 stars :D
Emma in the Night is one of the most twisted and disturbingA psychological thrillers to completely hold my interest this summer. If youaEURtmre a lover of psychological suspense, like your stories filled with drama and thrills, and insist they be intelligently crafted and extremely wellwritten, then look no further! An excellent and intelligent premise, a strongly driven plot, characters that are welldeveloped and range from intelligent, toxic, extremely unlikable, likable, and flawed all entwine to make this novel an exceptional read! This was my first Wendy Walker book, but it wonaEURtmt be my last! I was spellbound by the story of the two Tanner sisters, Emma and Cass, who vanished one night at the ages of 17 and 15. There had been no traces of either girl in the years since they had gone missing, so Emma was presumed dead since her car and purse were found abandoned at the beach and no one knew what happened to Cass, who had vanished without a trace. The FBI searched but failed to find anything although Dr. Abigail Abby Winter, FBI forensic psychiatrist suspected the Tanner household was highly dysfunctional, neglectful, and that Mrs. Martin, the girlaEURtms mother was suffering from a pathological narcissistic personality disorder, which was the reason for the girlaEURtms disappearances. Abby was never given a chance to pursue her theories though before the case was shut down. The story really begins when Cass suddenly reappears on her mothers doorstep three years later, very much aliveaEURand alone. CassaEURtms reappearance instigates a reopening of the FBI investigation when all she can tell anyone, in the beginning, is they must find Emma! Emma is alive! This prompts Mrs. Martin to repeatedly tell everyone that Cass is suffering from mental delusions and needs a psychiatric evaluation. I immediately wondered what Mrs. Martin was hiding and why she wanted Cass to have mental delusions instead for Cass to be telling the truth. Why was the mother not more concerned about finding her oldest daughter alive?! This led me to suspect certain things and although I was wrong about a few suspicions, I was right about others, including the big reveal at the end. It was excellent fun to delve into the psyches of all these characters and see just how twisted and messed up so many of them were! Walker did an excellent job introducing so many disturbing psychological aspects to the story that it was brilliant. However, if you are not into behavioral or cognitive psychology like I am, then this might not be the book for you since it is heavy on a lot of these themes. Cass tells her story in the first person POV, and it is not only a quite mysterious tale of where she has been but a horrific one of an emotionally abusive mother throughout her childhood. Cass is a strong young woman, but she is an unreliable narrator, which only made the story more captivating and enthralling! If you canaEURtmt trust the main protagonist, then who do you trust? I certainly wasnaEURtmt sure what to believe as she told the FBI that they were held captive on an island, and Cass had only escaped with the promise to return for Emma. IaEURtmm not going to go into the details of how the sisters came to be on the island since that part is very integral to the later plot, and I think the reader needs to go into that part completely blind and without any ideas that will spoil the story! The reader needs to be shocked when Cass makes her big reveal about what happened the night they both disappeared because believe me, it is shocking! What was horrible to read was CassaEURtms recollections of what it was like being raised in such a dysfunctional family where verbal and emotional abuse was the norm, fights between Emma and her mother were rampant, her mother gave and took her love like it was a prize to be won, and there was an unnatural interest in both Emma and Cass by their new stepbrother. It is these recollections that help convince the reader the girls ran away that night but did they? and were much better off far away. But if so, why did Cass reappear at all at her mothers house three years later? Besides getting Emma off the island, what is she up to? Dr. Winter reappears as the FBI investigation unfolds and her voice is the second POV in the story. She has the same feeling something is very wrong in the MartinTanner household that she had the first time she encountered Mrs. Martin. She herself is the daughter of a mother with narcissistic personality disorder, so she is all too familiar with the signs of a mother who must be placated by their children and told they are the best, most loved, most beautiful of all and are always in competition with their children. She sees all the signs as Cass placates her mother, always wants her around and is very docile towards her; yet, Abby is also reading signs that there is more to CassaEURtms actions than meets the eye just as there is so much more to what is really going on with the story Cass tells about her and EmmaaEURtms disappearance and her escape. Emma in the Night was such an addictive read! I loved how it made me question what was real and what wasnaEURtmt since I love my suspense to be unpredictable! And the ending was more than shocking, it was intense and superb in every way! I highly recommend Wendy WalkeraEURtms newest novel if you want to read a satisfying family drama full of mystery, secrets, revenge, love, and hate. You canaEURtmt go wrong with what will be one of summeraEURtms hottest psychological suspense hits! Thank you to NetGalley, St. Martins Press, and Wendy Walker for an ARC of this novel in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.
The darkest minds in time never fade in the afterlight. Ive been giving good to excellent ratings so many times lately that Ive started to wonder if maybe Ive gone soft. If maybe I need to take a break from reading YA for a while. But then I start comparing the books I read this year to the ones I read in 2013 and 2014 and I guess a lot of them just werent as good. Its been a few days since I finished The Darkest Minds and Im halfway through the sequel as we speak finished the novella as well. I dont regret hitting that fifth star. Not one bit. This was good. Really good. In most ways this is a typical dystopia, but that doesnt mean it cant compete with the best. Yes. I said it. It has so much potential to become great. This book had been recommended to me endlessly. Everyone kept saying I should read it, but Id never really gotten around to it until this summer. And man do I regret putting it off that long. First of all, I had no idea what this book would be about. I didnt read the blurb on goodreads, god, I didnt even read the back of the book. Thats how clueless I was when I started it. Imagine my surprise at the setting I found myself in. Camps. Workrehabilitation camps. They gave me the shivers actually. Still do. Mainly because I couldnt help comparing them to the WWII camps, you know? I get that this is fantasy and that they were very different, but I suppose theres no denying where the idea came from. These were all children, though. Jeez. That fucked me up big time. The Darkest Minds tend to hide behind the most unlikely faces. Ruby. Ruby is one perfectly flawed heroine. Whats to say? I loved her. Not just because she was broken or because she stood up for herself and slowly turned into this brave and powerful young woman. All of that was true and all of that made me like her and want to throw my arms around her. But I especially admired her because of what she was willing to sacrifice for the ones she loved. Theres something dangerously compelling about sacrifice in these kind of circumstances. It took a long time for her to start trusting people again, to start accepting who she was, but shes never halfin. She doesnt make the easiest choices. She makes the ones that are necessary, however painful they might be for her. Ruby reminded me of June from the Legend series. They are very alike. I think maybe the most frustrating thing in the world is to have something to say but not know how to put it into words. Its not just about Ruby though. She has to share the top spot in my list of favorite The Darkest Mindscharacters with Liam. And Zu. And Chubs. All of the characters were just so different and wellbuilt and excruciatingly likable. My heart is full of them. I couldnt choose between them if you held a gun to my head and threatened to blow my brains out. Honestly. Zu was adorable, Chubs was loyal and the best friend you could ever ask for and Liam was so, so genuinely good it hurt. And then Im not even talking about other characters that were profoundly shaped and complex, even if they appeared only for a short time. I. Am. Complete. Trash. The romance in this book is really well handled. It never takes the focus on the main story away. Its subtly finds its way in and it is never ever too cheesy. They sort of become friends first and I always appreciate that. They are my favorite kind of romances. Ruby, give me one reason why we cant be together, and Ill give you a hundred why we can. We can go anywhere you want. You could read this book for the characters alone, but theres so much more. The plot is really creative. Maybe the entire idea of children with special abilities isnt new, but Alexandra Bracken owns it. She creates a world that sucks you in from the very first page. Its a brutal one that lacks any kind of sympathy. Theres nothing about the circumstances she builds that you would ever envy. And that makes you very emotionally invested. You could feel bad for just about every one. Every character in this book has been shaped into what heshe is today by an impossibly awful past. The children in this world are struck by a virus that either kills them or makes them outcasts. Society fears them, loathes them. If they want to survive they have to build themselves a hard and terrifying life on the run. It sucks, but it beats the alternative of being sent into the rehabilitation program. Which should sufficiently prepare you for feels and heartache. Because ohmygod THAT ENDING. The most important thing you ever did was learn how to survive. Do not let anyone make you feel like you shouldnt have. Clearly theres also a bigger picture. One that doesnt become too clear in this first book, but will definitely be developed over the course of the next installments. Im really curious to find out how things will work out. I have so many questions, so many suspicions, fears and hopes. I think its safe to say I will finish this series rather soon. No way Ill stop reading until I know exactly how it ends. I guess theres something to say for starting to read a series once all of the books have been published. Its probably also a good thing I only started reading when most of the hype had died down already. If you are, like I was, waiting for the good opportunity to start dont waste any more time hesitating. Just pick up the book and start READING. Just to finish I want to react on something I read in the reviews of this book. Some people seem to think this book is too long. Let me tell you, I dont want to read that ever again. If a book is good, it can never be too long. Honestly, Im sick of young adult publishers trying to release as many books as possible, even when the story could have fit perfectly in just one or two books. Besides, the books in this series are not that long. So enjoy them. Lets carpe the hell out of this diem.
Breathtaking, heartbreaking, merrymaking. As a lover of words, there are few books I can say I disdain, and yet there are only a handful that I would give 5 stars. Clockwork Princess truly transported me to a world where I felt the characters were real enough to touch. Cassandra Clare knows how to bring characters and relationships to life. Had someone just explained this book to me and what happened to the characters, I might have smiled and said it clever, but I would have probably thought it somewhat cliche because the story does follow a love triangle like many YA books out there today. And yet this love story felt different to me in many ways. Maybe because it wasnt just about the romantic love felt between swoonworthy characters. Though Tessas saga is one of true love, the love story that drew me in was that of Will and Jemtwo friends who have a connection that only Clare could write. spoiler alert When I thought Jem had died and Wills parabatai mark faded, my heart ached for him. The scene by the oak tree has to be one of the most heartfelt scenes Ive ever read. The whole last half of the novel, I prayed that somehow Jem had survived. I found myself speaking out loud for these fictional characters, shouting NO when something dreadful happened and giggling uncontrollably, especially at Wills humor. I also loved the quotes and literary references. It makes me want to read every book that I havent yet read and appreciate writers that have long since gone. Im not sure if Cassandra Clare meant to do it, but I can see many teens and adults alike flocking to some of the classics just because of reading this book. In years to come, I think quotes from Clockwork Princess and probably the whole series will grace the pages of the internet. That being said, I think Ill share a few of my favorites because, honestly, I dont think i can give justice to this book with my own words. Life is a book, and there are a thousand pages I have not read. I would read them together with you, as many as I can, before I die  She put her hand against his chest, just over his heart, and felt its beat against her palm, a unique time signature that was all its own. I only wish you would not speak of dying, she said. But even for that, yes, I know how you are with your words, and, Will I love all of them. Every word you say. The silly ones, the mad ones, the beautiful ones, and the ones that are only for me. I love them, and I love you. You know that feeling, she said, when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing tight around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage and you cannot let go or turn the course aside. His blue eyes were dark with understanding  of course Will would understand  and she hurried on. I feel now as if the same is happening, only not to characters on a page but to my own beloved friends and companions. I do not want to sit by while tragedy comes for us. I would turn it aside, only I struggle to discover how that might be done. Sometimes one must choose whether to be kind or honorable, he said. Sometimes one cannot be both. Men may be stronger, but it is women who endure. Magnus took a deep breath and spoke gently. Will. You asked me for my wisdom, as someone who has lived many lifetimes and buried many loves. I can tell you that the end of a life is the sum of the love that was lived in it, that whatever you think you have sworn, being here at the end of Jems life is not what is important. It was being here for every other moment. Since you met him, you have never left him and never not loved him. That is what matters. Some secrets, she thought, were better told; some were better left the burden of the carrier, that they might not cause pain to others. Will bit at his lip. This was the last time Jem, as Jem, might ever touch him. The sharp memory went through him like a knifeof years of Jems light tap on his shoulder, his hand reaching to help Will up when he fell, Jem holding him back when he was furious, Wills own hands on Jems thin shoulders as Jem coughed blood into his shirt. Listen to me. I am leaving, but I am living. I will not be gone from you entirely, Will. When you fight now, I will be still by you. When you walk in the world, I will be the light at your side, the ground steady under your feet, the force that drives the sword in your hand. We are bound, beyond the oath. The Marks did not change that. The oath did not change that. It merely gave words to something that existed already. My Content Rating: PG13 SEXUALITY:Moderate lots of kissing, and one sex scene LANGUAGEPROFANITY: Mild only things like: by the angel etc. DRUGALCOHOL USE: Mild Jems addition to Yin Fen and a mention of Will getting drunk INTENSESCARY SCENES: Moderate VIOLENCE: Heavy fight scenes, head chopped off, lots of bloodichor
 spoiler alert  Holy shitballs this is a long review. I tried to trim but honestly, this is the best I can do and still say what I need to say. First off, some naked truths. I am a spoiler whore. I did not go into this book blind as is recommended. To the contrary I knew A LOT of the plot going in. To me, a review hidden behind a spoiler link is buried treasure. THIS REVIEW IS HIDDEN BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS translates to EmmaSpeak as SECRETS IN HERE! COME AND SEE! Clickbait. I cant resist. But also, I dont necessarily like going in blind. I want to know stuff. I want to study mechanics and the inner blood and guts of the words on the page. Because I write myself, my main interest is not now seeing WHAT an author did, but HOW she did it. Plot is second to craft. Therefore, its safe to say that this review is going to be bursting to the seams in spoilers, under a cut or not. If you dont want to be spoiled, you really shouldnt read this. This is a review for those who have already read the book. The dozens of us. ; OR....if you havent read it and dont care about spoilers with the same glorious, carefree manner in which I dont care about spoilers, than I shall tell you this book is about domestic violence. However, those words cant convey the power and complexity contained within this novel. We have Ryle, this hot neurosurgeon with a temper who meets Lily, an aspiring florist, on a rooftop in Boston and so sets in motion their love story. Such as it is. I see why the author wanted you to go in blind, so you walk Lilys path with her, fall in love with Ryle when she does, etc. But that was never going to happen with me. Even if I had gone in blind, Id still take a separate journey than Lily, walking alongside her instead of in her shoes. I didnt like Ryle from the getgo. He is not my cuppa H tea. At all. His actions preabuse rubbed me the wrong way so I was never going to like him. I was never going to root for them. I was never going to enjoy watching Lily fall for him. Now Atlas, on the other hand, is an H I love to read about. Hes an H I love to WRITE about. Kind, considerate, and down on his luck. The trifecta of what makes a perfect H. The fact that Id spoilered myself all to hell about certain aspects of this book didnt impinge on my ability to appreciate it. That is part of this books genius. I dont know if the author realizes this, but one doesnt have to like or love Ryle. Its not about Ryle. This book is about Lily. Her choices and decisions, her pain and love, her heartache and triumphs, andby extensionits about every woman whos been in the situation shes been in. Some other people this book is for: Women who have not been in this situation but think they know what theyd do if they were. thats my category Women who have no idea what theyd do. Men who would never raise a hand to a woman in anger. Men who raise a hand to women in anger repeatedly and promise never to do it again. And its for every single solitary personmale or femalewho has ever wondered, Why does she stay? instead of Why does he hit? Aside from the journal entries from Lilys younger days and her past with Altas, I did not enjoy the first 25 of the book. Those journal entries and Atlas kept me going through the romance with Ryle I was never on board with, but it was when the shit hit the fan between he and Lily for the first time, thats when this book skyrocketed. I have not been in a situation like Lilys so I have no personal frame of reference that would draw me closer to the story. And, as stated, I disliked Ryle from the getgo. Both those facts that should have given me a soft cushion of distance from the emotional impact the book. They did not. From the moment Ryle first lays a hand on Lily to the end of the last chapter, we are taken through the intricate, confusing, multilayered thought processes of a woman trying to navigate her life in the face of an abusive partner. Someone she loves. A flesh and blood human to whom she has tied her life to, not some cliched villain. We are taken from Lilys first doubts and fears through a complex and escalating set of circumstances. The instances of abuse become worse in a sort of terrible parallel with how Lilys life is more closely bound to Ryles. From being together, being pushed, getting married, getting thrown down the stairs becoming pregnant, becoming viciously attacked... These instances are tangled together, and we are masterfully guided through Lilys emotions, all her pain and fear, her love and joy, her doubt and selfloathing. It is an expertly mapped, masterful journey from A to Z, with no aspect left untouched, until finally she comes to an ultimate conclusion that somehow made me cheer in triumph and cry for her loss at the exact same fucking time. My parents were great, my husband is the epitome of kindness and grace. But I have an imagination. I have always imagined myself as the kind of woman who thought, should I ever become involved with an abusive man, Id leave immediately. First time. No second chances, etc etc. I still think Im that kind of woman, but I can use my imagination to create a bizarro world in which my husband turned on me. After working so hard for so many years we just moved to a new condo that is the best place weve ever lived. Our kids go to one of the best schools in the country. And so I imagine what would happen if I had to leave him. Would I have to move in with my parents who do not live anywhere near a good school system? Take the kids away from their friends. My friends? Would I strike out on my own? Ive been out of the workforce, writing and raising kids for almost 10 years. Could I get a job to support the girls and me if I moved out? I think about the upheaval in my life of everything my hubs and I worked to build. How it would feel if it all had to come crashing down. How our family would be ripped apart. How Id have to explain to the girls what happened... Or I could just give him one more chance and keep everything as is. I could take the emotional turmoil and suck it down, keep it inside, so that the surface remains placid and calm, and tell myself its for the greater good. I have a feeling reasoning really kicked her ass a time or two. Afuckingmen. There is a right answer to this scenario but never, EVER should it be assumed that its an easy one to make. That right there, is why this book gets five enormous stars. What Lily experienced is not the experience of every abused woman. But its not about plot, remember? Its about the how and the why. To my mind, this author captured and conveyed the essence of this particular brand of emotional turmoil and set it in a context that even this reader, who has no personal frame of reference to speak of, reached complete and utter understanding. And understanding does more to foster positive change in this world than anything else. ES
Oh hell yes. This is everything I could have asked for and more in a contemporary book. I have been wanting to read this book for over a year now and for some reason I never got around to it. This book has one of the most GORGEOUS covers I have ever seen, the typography is beautiful, and the dust jacket even has a picture underneath it and omg, its freaking gorgeous to look at. My favorite thing in the world is when a beautiful ass looking book has an even better beautiful ass story inside of it. I love a good story about friendship, and love, and discovering who you are. This is a beautiful coming of age story. I strongly recommend this to people who are the lessoutgoing type of person in their group of friends. Or people who consider themselves shy and quiet. I feel those kind of people will relate to this the most, as I did. Emily is one of the most relatable characters Ive ever read about. I dont think Ive related to a character as much since Cath from Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell. Sure, Emily is a little immature at times, but I totally get where she is coming from and she wears her heart on her sleeve. Emily and Sloanes friendship is amazing. It kind of hit me at home because it reminded me soooo much of this friendship I had with this girl in high school. She was so outgoing and popular and more spontaneous than I was and I envied her and wanted to be more like her at the same time, in the same way Emily sees Sloane. I completely understood what Emily meant when she said she feared that someday Sloane would get bored of her or realize shes not as fun as she thought and go find someone who will be more adventurous with her because I had those same exact fears with all of my relationships. I still do. I love the idea that Sloane left behind a list of things for Emily to do that scared her, or at least pushed her out of her comfort zone. Sloane knew that Emily would be devastated without her, so she left her a list of things that would help Emily discover who she is as her own person, and I think thats amazing. I love how through the process of Emily trying to complete all these tasks, not only did she face her fears, but she unknowingly matured and really lived. I just love that. All these experiences will be some of the best memories she has, all thanks to Sloane. Theres that saying that I really believe is true: You dont know who you are until you lose who you are. and I think that applies here. Emily had to lose what she thought was her better half, Sloane, to discover who she really is and what shes capable of. I just love a good coming of age story if you couldnt tell. This felt like the way you get nervous right before something exciting happens the moment youre balanced on the top of the roller coaster, the hush before the surprise, the second after the diving board but before the water, when you can close your eyes and imagine, for just a second, that youre flying. The feeling that good things were coming, almost here, any moment now. Also, the romance. I adored Emily and Franks interactions. It was so cute to see Emily come out of her shell around him and really open up. For so long Emily had experienced what it was like to be the 3rd wheel, and now it was finally her turn to be in the spotlight and left alone with someone of the opposite sex. One thing Emily said that I found so freaking relatable was: If there had been three of us, I would have been able to sit quietly, happily, joining in with laughter, feeling part of it, comfortable enough to jump in with a comment or an aside, but knowing the weight of the interaction wasnt on me. Honestly, that is so completely relatable to me that its insane and I didnt think anyone else really thought about that like I do. I find myself so nervous when Im left alone with someone I dont know all that well for fear of running out of things to talk about and Emily experiences the same fears. It would be so much easier if Sloane were there to help with conversation and Im the same way. I would want my sister or my best friend to be there and carry most of he conversation. I will admit I didnt like Collins in the beginning, but he definitely grew on me as a character. He had some hilarious lines in this book. Also, I loved how whenever Emily and Frank went on runs they would listen to each others iPods. It was just so cute. I love how Morgan Matson included the playlists in the book and I knew so many of the songs! It was exciting and she has really great taste in music! Taylor Swift, Lady Antebellum, Of Monsters And Men, The Cure, Young The Giant, Imagine Dragons, Florida Georgia Line, The Band Perry; I love all of those artists! I love Frank and Collins obsession with The Beatles and how they were constantly debating over who was a bigger fan. I freaking love The Beatles. I loved Emilys spontaneous friendship with Dawn and how everything unfolded. I also loved Frank and Emilys obsession with the saying In a wellordered universe and then reciting all these awesome things that they wish to be true. This book was just loads of fun to watch as Emily attempted to compete all these crazy tasks and even though this book is 450 pages it flew by so fast because I got so invested in these characters and grew to love each and every one of them. I dont know what took me so long to read this book. I dont even care though because it was well worth the wait. I now realize I have been writing this review for over 30 minutes and I should stop now but I just LOVED this book. So, the ending of this book didnt really surprise me. I had assumed that Sloane had moved away, I just couldnt wrap my head around why.. The ending kind of broke my heart and made me cry like a bitch. It was hard to read because I am moving this summer to a different state and I am leaving behind some close friends of mine so it literally hit home. When Emily and Sloane are talking about how they plan to stay in touch by being pen pals and sending each other lists and phone calls, and how no matter how many miles separated them nothing could change their friendship, that shit hit me hard because thats all the shit Im going through right now. So its safe to say I have a personal attachment to this book and it has helped me get through some shit Im currently going through. Also, my favorite scenes were when they did the indoor camping and Frank and Emily had to share a tent cause she forgot her pillow. I also loved when they crashed the wedding and she ended up literally dancing until dawn. I love the scene when they all went skinny dipping and Collins took all of their towels, I was dying of laughter. But most of all that last scene with her and Sloane finally seeing each other again. It was so great. And then how Emily left Sloane a list to do. That was adorable. And at the very end when Frank said In a wellordered universe, Id be able to do this and he kisses her. I was squealing because that was their thing and it made me all giddy inside. SO CUTE. If I had one complaint about the ending, it would be that I wanted a little more conclusion as to how things turned out with Collins and Dawn. Did they forgive her? Cause Dawn was pretty pissed in the last scene we saw her in and I love her friendship with Emily, so some conclusion there would have been nice. But other than that it was a damn perfect ending. Sorry that this review is nearly as long as this novel but I just needed to express MY FEELS.
I received a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. First I got delayed in reading and then I was delayed in reviewing, and so now at last here I am with my deplorably late thoughts on this book. Naomi Novik is one of my very favorite writers and has been for over a decade. To read anything by her is to read a work of great care and thoughtfulness and mastery of prose and attention to detail, and above all a work that youll find yourself thinking about for days. I think one of the reasons this book has received the kind of raves that it has is that the YA community just hasnt had that, to many of us extremely familiar, encounter with Noviks writing beforeand having had, it they dont know what to do with themselves. Agnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life. Take a look at the cover on the right: I really love that coverit does a wonderful job of representing the central dynamics and conflict of this book, namely the sanctity of community roots in the face of an encroaching, unavoidable conflict. No one knows why the local sorcerer insists that every ten years a girl be taken from the village to apprentice with him, but Agnieszka has known all her life that the day would come when the Dragon would take her best friend, the beautiful Kasia, away from her. Instead, on the day of the choosing, the Dragon takes herand in the middle of having her entire life uprooted, Agnieszka must contend with learning new secrets about herself, her town, and the people she loves. The first thing I want to say is how wellwritten and rich Uprooteds voice is. Agnieszka as a heroine is solid and stalwart even if she doesnt always know it, and that uncertainty comes through with remarkable clarity even while shes navigating extremely treacherous new social circles and struggling to master a whole new set of abilties. She is the emotional heart of Uprooted and thats crucial, because theres occasionally a lot of emotion to deal with, and she keeps us grounded in the middle of some pretty heavy and revelatory plot moments. Uprooted is a powerful and IMO deeply unique book for a bunch of reasons. Its rooted in Eastern European folklore and magic instead of the more traditional FrenchGermanEnglish variety. It explores folklore in a way that feels very personal to the author and to us as readers. But it also interrogates and reinterprets those myths; for example, while the myth of Baba Yaga looms large over the fic, Baba Yaga herself is never present. Instead, in a way that reminds me strongly of two of my most favorite YA novels ever, Frances Hardinges Fly By Night and Rachel Hartmans Seraphina, the characters have to apply her myth to their own lives, and draw as best they can from their stories, histories, and beliefs to make sense of the path before them. In Uprooted, myth functions the way it does in our own worldas a muddy, confusing guidebook for how we should try to go on. Uprooted draws natural comparisons to Beauty and the Beastyoung girl, taken against her will to live in a brooding castle overseen by a mysterious brusque man who mistreats her until plot happensbut theres a huge difference between that sort of story and Uprooted. These characters arent living in a fairy tale, or even a world powered by magic. Theyre living in a world like ours, with real problemspolitical, environmental, personaland limited options for solving them. In Uprooted, magic is only one option, and it may not even be the best. The other most important thing I can say about this book is that its commitment to its own idealistic worldview is firm and steadfast. Uprooted allows you to doubtin the power of community, of friendship, of stewardship, and of magicand then have your faith renewed over and over, each time more cathartically than the last. One of the most powerful moments of the book for me is the moment when Agnieszka and Kasia finally learn secrets about each other, their lives in the village, and their friendshipdeep secrets that theyve kept hidden from each other for so long, you think that the sudden onslaught of truth will drive them apart. Instead, you realize that that truth creates a shared burden of pain and awareness, and that in turn creates an even deeper bond of love. Again and again the most surprising and heartclenchingly good thing about Uprooted is its humanism, its faith in people against truly terrifying odds. I have to mention the one thing about this book that deeply bothered me. Its not something that Ive seen other reviewers discuss, although I did have a brief conversation on Twitter today with another reader who found it troubling the way I did. So I feel a little weird even mentioning it because I dont want to come across as a ranty naysayer. And again I loved everything else about this book. The thing I didnt love is that the relationship between Agnieszka and the Dragon feels not only incredibly shallow but incredibly emotionally abusive to me. Although she never seems to deeply register it or portrays any sign of ill effects from it, for the first few months shes in the castle, the Dragon subjects her to what seemed to me like serious and extreme emotional abuse, particularly humiliation. He makes her crawl on her hands and knees, he totally isolates her, he forces her to learn his arbitrary rules without explaining to her what the rules are until she breaks them, he makes her wear awkward and uncomfortable clothing, the list goes on and on. Theres also the fact that hes done this to other girls repeatedly for decades, but when he finally repents, he does so offscreen, in a conversation with another character, and only offers a casual oh btw i told X im sorry about all that sort of apology. And its never made an issue again. To say that this bothered me would be an understatement. Two years ago I very briefly lived in an emotionally abusive household and I could not handle it at all, and this honestly really upset me because I kept wondering when the narrative was going to deal with the effects of his treatment of her... but then there were only positive effects. It seemed an inexplicable vanishing subplot, and I was left wondering why the emotional abuse theme was even present in the book at allit wasnt necessary, and it definitely didnt increase the appeal of the romantic hero. So I would definitely rec this with a huge caveat and a giant warning sign for people who are sensitive about depictions of emotional abusive. But ultimately I would say this is a rec, because all the things I loved about Uprooted were things I really, really loved.
Original post at One More Page So everyone whos ever read and loved science fiction has read and loved Enders Game by Orson Scott Card. My friends who have read and loved science fiction also were true to their responsibility to push this book to everyone, particularly people who are curious about the said genre. Particularly, me. But a little commercial first: Ive always thought that I never read any science fiction book in my entire reading life. But it turns out, one of my favorite young adult series growing up was science fiction: Animorphs by K.A. Applegate. Five kids and one alien with the power to morph into any animal they touch against an alien race of parasite slugs set to invade the world? If that is not science fiction, I will eat my hat. And so Enders Game. It was duly recommended, but for some reason a copy eluded me until my friend Monique found one for me. Of course, as luck would have it, I end up seeing copies of the book everywhere after I got the copy. But anyway! Of course, it takes me another year to read it, but I dont really think it matters now. The Wiggin children, Peter, Valentine and Andrew aka Ender, were all candidates for the soldier training program in their childhood, but only the youngest, Ender, makes the cut. Ender has always been distant with his family so joining Battle School wasnt much of a difference in his young life. Enders skills made him a leader in Battle School, admired and hated at the same time by his classmates. But Enders brilliance in the Battle Room had a price  isolation, loneliness, and the fear that he is becoming like his older brother who he despises. But there are secrets around Enders training, secrets that could very well mean the survival of the human race in a war against an alien race for the last hundred years. Heres one thing about Enders Game: its so readable. Im initially apprehensive of reading science fiction and high fantasy novels because Im afraid of not being able to fully immerse into the world. If its not very obvious yet, Im really a contemporary reader and most of the books I read are set in the real world, so reading something set in a different world, or set in the future is quite a challenge for me. Orson Scott Card made Enders Game very accessible, though, and it was easy enough to understand what was happening in Enders world. Oh, I didnt really understand much of how the Battle School worked, or the space travel later into the book, but I had a pretty okay grasp with it early in the story, so reading it slowly became a breeze. I loved the military setup over the scifi aspect. People say this is really more of a military novel, and I kind of agree with that. Reading this reminded me of those Citizen Army Training days back in high school, where wed practice rifle drills and do other activities during camp, like Search  Destroy and Escape  Evade I hate the latter, btw. I liked reading about the strategies and the platoon toon set up and the promotions. I love reading about the war games in null gravity  it made me wish that laser tag games here were done in the same environment! I would probably be the first to be frozen in that, but it would be so much fun. It was fascinating to see how Ender came up with strategies to confuse his enemies in the games and wonder at how he was able to see it and make it work. And there isnt just the military thing either. The political aspects of war  in space and on earth  were discussed, too, and it makes readers see that some wellplaced words said or written on a platform can be enough to start a war. A bit of suspension of disbelief might be in order for the part of the novel is needed, but if you can believe that a six year old is the hope of the world against an alien race, then believing that part should be easy enough. Poor Ender, though. I keep on forgetting that he was just a kid six years old at the start of the novel as the story progressed. He always seemed older, especially with all the military school talk. Enders fighter qualities were admirable and oftentimes scary, but it was hard not to root for him in the story. I sympathized a lot with Valentine, Enders sister, with how she cared for him because I wanted to take care of Ender too, and keep him a kid longer because he deserved to be one. I also liked Enders friends, too, especially the ones who were with him at the end. There was this one particular scene that really made my heart swell with happiness for Ender that involved his friends, and it shows that true friends are those people who are with you in your darkest hours. There is a fair amount of violence in this book, so a fair warning to those who think that this is about some kids who get roped into a save the world thing. Even more horrifying is that these are just kids beating each other up. Despite that, Enders Game is pretty, well, darn good. I know Im not a credible judge of science fiction since like I said I barely read the genre, but I think Enders Game is science fiction at its simplest and maybe at its finest, too. Its no wonder why people kept on recommending this to me. If youre a newbie to science fiction and youre looking for titles to start with, then listen to everyone who has recommended this book to you because trust me: they are right about it. If its not enough, then let its awards push you to the right direction. Also, a movie is coming out next year. Enough reasons? Get a copy and remember: the enemys gate is down! :
First of all, I loved this. Its probably one of my favorite releases of 2014. The writing was creative, funny, and engaging. I tried to savor it by reading slowly, but I couldnt. It was so captivating. This isnt going to be much of a review as much as all the things Ill loved about it. And its going to be filled with spoilers. And fangirling. Me after I finished the book: I love how Marissa Meyer ties all the stories together. This picks up just days after the end of Scarlet. Many are dead. Prince Kai has agreed to marry Queen Levana. Cinder is still a wanted criminal. Things arent looking good for the crew. The opening chapter is about Cress, the Rapunzel of the series. Her tower is a satellite. The witch is none other than the Queens thaumaturge, Sybil. I liked Cresss character, more than Scarlet but not as much as Cinder, because she is so kickass. One thing I love about these books are the skills the female characters have. Cinders a mechanic, Scarlets a pilot, and Cress is a hacker. Those arent your typical female professions, and that sets these characters apart. Cress is smart, but reserved, which makes sense, given the fact shes been living on a satellite for most of her life. I loved her resourcefulness. Cress and Thorne. I loved them. Not as much as Cinder and Kai, but close. They are so cute together! I like how Cress develops a crush on Thorne before ever meeting him, and she researched him to the point where she knows more about his past than he does. And although she is naive, Thorne also acknowledges that and takes care of her. Captain, she murmured. I think Im in love with you. An eyebrow shot up. She counted six beats of his heart before, suddenly, he laughed. Dont tell me it took you two whole days to realize that. I must be losing my touch. Her fingertips curled up against him. You knew? That youre lonely, and Im irresistible? Yeah. I knew. Come on, Cress, youre getting up. Do you think you could ever love me back? Cress, this is sweet, but arent I the first guy youve ever met? And his promise to Cress! One of my favorite parts: I guess its time. While Cresss thoughts continued to churn through the horrible things that could happen to her, she felt herself being suddenly spun around and dipped backward, a supportive arm scooping beneath her back. She yelped and caught herself on Thornes shoulder. Then he was kissing her. In the original Rapunzel, the prince falls out of her tower into a thorn bush and goes blind. The prince of our storys name is Thorne. How cruel is that? I thought Thorne going blind made him a lot more dependent on Cress, and so it was necessary to move their relationship along. I love how he needs her as a guide and how shes unhelpful when describing the scenery. Cress? Its beautiful out there. A hesitation, before, Could you be more specific? The sky is gorgeous, intense blue color. She pressed her fingers to the glass and traced the wavy hills on the horizon. Oh, good. Youve really narrowed it down for me. But, moving on to Cinder and Kai! I had been waiting a whole two books for their reunion, and it did not disappoint. I cant believe she shot him and kidnapped him. Its just such a Cinder thing to do. Their talk though...just. Kai can be a little slow. The entire time, I was thinking, come on Kai, when will you figure out that the princess is CINDER! Even when she was trying to tell him.... But when he finds out, and then she tells him about her eyes and her netscreen....they are just too adorable. Im honestly not a big fan of Scarlet and Wolf, so I didnt mind their lack of appearance in this book. Still, I hate that Scarlet was taken by the Lunars and I got so scared for her. The Lunar boy that abuses her is so messed up, Id hate to see him as an adult. We got to see Winter in this though! Im glad she took Scarlet under her care. She is really weird, but Im hoping she can pull herself together with the help of Scarlet to escape Levanas clutches in Winter. I really liked how Marissa Meyer gave us slight foreshadowing in the first book when Dr. Erland was talking about Lunars going crazy when they dont use their powers. Winter is a perfect example of that, and I think her mental instability is going to cause a lot of problems in the next book. I really want to get inside her head and get a back story for why she doesnt use her powers. The poor girl... Wolf just got on my nerves. I cant really blame him, because Scarlet was the only thing that made him more human. Without her hes just sad. Having him moping around and out of control definitely caused some unnecessary problems in this book. Who else saw Cress being Dr. Erlands daughter? I think Ive had the suspicion since the first book, because there is a short part where he talks about why he left Luna, and it just fit together: the dead daughter and orphan Cress. I wish he had told her sooner though! Just when she finds out she has a father, someone who loves her, he has to die! How unfair is that? I teared up at that part. I liked Dr. Erland. He did so much for Cinder. He told her who she was, got her cool cyborg parts, helped her escape, and fixed hopefully Thornes eyes. Now who are we supposed to turn to when something goes wrong? I felt like Cinder, as always, was carrying the team. Shes the only one without a lot of problems in this book, and everybody else seems like a liability. Seriously. Scarlets gone. Wolfs going crazy again. Thorne is blind. Cress has never been to earth. Dr. Erland is weak and dying. Need I go on? I felt really bad for Cinder, because she was the only one who had everything together. Still, the teams difficulties caused some pretty close calls and interesting scenes. I loved this book so much and its definitely my favorite out of the series. I cannot wait for Winter. Another year? No. I cant handle the wait and now Im really wishing I waited until the series was complete to start it. Oh, well. In the end, I do this to myself.
Originally Posted On The Sassy Book Geek I want to believe that theres more. That we could be more. Hell, we could be heroes. First off all Id like to say that I did this as a Buddy Read with Ariana. It was a lot of fun and I hope to do it again sometime since Ariana has great and similar taste in books! Can I just use an Incredibles gif to sum up my entire review on a super hero book? No? Ok fine..... This book was amazing and I give all of that credit to V.E. Schwabs incredible writing, seriously shes definitely my new favorite author. Vicious is easily one of my new favorite books as well. This is a book all about super powers and heroes versus villains, or is it? Who are the real villains and the real heroes? Quite simply the answer is, there are none. Not in Vicious anyways. Plenty of humans were monstrous, and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human. This quote easily sums up the entirety of this book, I think. Also there are TONS of great quotes from this book, just saying. So Lets Talk About That Plot: I think its safe to say the entire plot of Vicious is one big morally gray area. There is no good or evil, only an inbetween and even then it gets a bit...blurry. The storyline is intense and highly addictive, every chapter ended with its own minicliffhanger. It definitely left me craving more and forced me to keep reading. Theres just so much suspense and every little thing was building up to something bigger. Seriously, theres SO MUCH SUSPENSE. One way that Schwab built up this suspense was by alternating perspectives, not only did we get insight into multiple characters POVs but we also jumped back and forth in timelines. Normally thats something that can be pretty annoying and confusing, having chapters in the past and present both, but ultimately Schwab uses it in her favor. By doing this we are given pieces of the story one at a time, which definitely adds mystery to the story as a whole. I also thought a lot of things that occurred in the story were VERY unpredictable, I felt like I was being bombarded with tiny plot twists! If it was possible to cover my eyes while also continuing to read I would have while reading Vicious. Thats something I REALLY loved about this book, the shock factor. When I dont see things coming and am truly shocked by a turn of events, I know itll turn out being a great read. Vicious certainly turned out to be a GREAT read indeed. Now....Those Characters: Vicious is a VERY character driven book and I was not disappointed with them at all. The characters are easily the best part about this book, hands down. Theyre all incredibly complex, well developed, and more than a little fucked up. They all have flaws that make them feel all the more realistic and you wont be able to help sympathizing with them. Nobody is inherently good or evil, theyre all just morally conflicted and everyone follows their own agendas. Some do good things but for ulterior motives and some do bad things for reasons, in their eyes, are for the greater good. There wasnt a single character I didnt love or at least loved to hate, how could I hate such well written characters? Victor Vale is more or less our main protagonist and my personal favorite. Sure hes hellbent on revenge and will do anything necessary to get it, but hes not all that bad. As I said Victors main concern is getting his revenge but there are certain things he does that really shows his humanity, making it impossible to despise him for the bad things he does. Eli Ever is an asshat. He likes to play hero and has delusions that hes supposed to carry out Gods will by killing off EOs people with extraordinary gifts. Yeah, Elis pretty much deranged. I HATED HIM. Which is what made him an excellent character also, I mean he has to be pretty well written for me to hate him so much....... The secondary characters such as: Mitch, Sydney, Serena, Dominic, and Dol were also just as fantastic and all had their own flaws making them feel just as important and real as Victor and Eli. Serena falls into the same category as Eli, super messed up in the head. She does some extremely questionable things but still manages to show some decency that makes it so you cant quite hate her as much. Sydney is a sweet and innocent 12 year old girl. I felt protective of her throughout the story, shes just too awesome and precious. Mitch is actually one of my other favorite characters, hes probably one of the nicest and most sincere people in this book. Meaning, Mitch actually has a conscience. We didnt actually see a lot of Dominic but hes a pretty sympathetic character, well maybe in more of a you pity him kind of way. Anyways his power is freaking sweet and my personal favorite. Dol is a dog. Do I need to say more? Hes an awesome, cute dog. That is all. In Conclusion: Vicious is definitely one of my new all time favorite books, how can you go wrong with morally ambiguous characters with super powers? Well maybe you can but not if youre V.E. Schwab. Now all I have to do is wait for the sequel.... Recommend? A thousand times yes! If you love morally conflicting characters and if you want an adult super hero story then I recommend reading Vicious. Or if youre not a big fan of super heroes and just want a really suspenseful, fast paced story then Id give this a go as well.
I want to start off by saying that while I am a fan of Clare and her work I try not to encourage the extreme hype and controversy that surrounds her. However, Lady Midnight deserves all of the praise it gets. Expertly crafted, beautifully written, and surprisingly dark, Clare weaves a magical mystery with family drama and romantic drama seamlessly. Her writing has improved so much its astounding. I have stayed up all night finishing this. More thoughts when Im not half dead! Okay, Ive slept a few more hours and I am ready to begin. Warning, there wont be heavy spoilers but I will be revealing little details about characters so if you dont want to know anything about the book, dont read. It is NOT necessary to read TMI, TID, The Bane Chronicles, and Tales of the Shadowhunter Academy in order to read Lady Midnight but you WILL be spoiled for certain events that happened in these books except for TBC and TotSA. I highly recommend reading them because they are awesome I personally love TID and TotSA the most and because youll understand certain inside jokes in the book. As you can tell from the synopsis, this takes place five years after the events of TMI. Its 2012 and we follow Emma Carstairs and the Blackthorns  Cristina as they try to solve the murders in Los Angeles of both mundanes and fae, and who Emma believes to be behind the murders of her parents. A fae convoy comes and says that in exchange for the LA institutes help they will let Mark choose to either stay with his family or return to the Wild Hunt. Lady Midnight is part detective story, part family drama, with plenty of romance and magic. We meet new characters who I LOVE. Honestly, I love the Blackthorns, Emma, and Cristina. I love their dynamic and how close their family is. They are ruthless. Namely, Julian. Hes had to take care of four kids since he was 12. Yeah, Uncle Arthur is there but theres something about him that is pretty much useless when it comes to the kids. In the wake of their fathers death, Helens exile, and Marks capture by the Hunt, Julian is essentially their father. Emma has been by his side the whole time and shes watched him learn how to take care of young Tavvy, cook, clean, buy groceries, etc. all while easing their nightmares. Hes had to grow up very quickly and there is nothing he wouldnt do to keep his family together, nothing. He wanted to be parabatai with Emma because he was so afraid the Clave would send her away to the Academy, and he needed Emma to stay. Emma is his rock, and its understandable. They are childhood friends who would do anything for each other. And they are certainly NOT a new JaceWill or ClaryTessa. Their personalities are wholly unique and it was great being in the minds of kids who knew who their parents were, have grown up in the Shadowhunter world all their lives, and live in the aftermath of a war. The plot is amazing. You have the overarching plot of solving the murders and finding out whos behind them for Emmas parents and hopefully getting Mark back. Then you have the subplots of Emma and Julians feelings for each other, Kieran  Mark  Cristina  Diego and that whole fiasco, and whether or not Mark will actually choose to stay. Lemme tell you, I was actually suspicious of Diana for quite awhile. She disappears on her own for long periods of time, shes obviously done something illegal, and she holds a lot of secrets. It took me awhile to figure out whos behind everything, and I was pretty sad. It is honestly a pretty heartbreaking story. I think what I love most about the book is how diverse it is. Cristina is Mexican, Diana is black, Mark is bisexual like Helen, and Ty is confirmed by Cassandra to have autism. I wish he could get the professional help he needs. Arthur is obviously mentally ill. Hearing about other shadowhunters who have dyslexia, depression, ADHD etc. and getting hidden away is just so sad. For everything the Clave can do they are not progressive people. They should know that mundanes have medical help for them and should see them as just any other illness that should be treated. I really hope this will be explored more as the trilogy continues, especially with Ty. I do love all of the support he gets from his family, especially from Julian. Marks sexuality isnt really a big thing to him, its just a part of who he is and Im so glad because thats how it should be. Honestly, I love how Clare was so influenced by Annabel Lee took Poes poem and turned it into a shadowhunter thing. The English Lit nerd part of me who loves Poe realized the chapter titles were lines from Annabel Lee and I got so happy. Clare weaves the poem into the plot so well, its amazing. I also loved how Clare hinted that Poe somehow found out about Malcolm and Annabels story and thats who the poem is based off of. SHIPPING MARK AND CRISTINA SO HARD. I just love how Cristina grounds Mark, especially in the beginning when he was readjusting to the human world and being around his family. I dunno, I just have such a soft spot for Mark. Hes been through so much, and I just want him to be happy. Diego is a dummy and can go away because honestly if he really loved Cristina he would have defended her to Jaime. Also, his brother Jaime sounds like a sociopath if he really has no compassion and empathy in his heart. Im really hoping everyone works their love lives out. Emma and Julian need to be saved somehow and Mark and Cristina need to be together. The whole parabatai problem is obviously very worrisome, and Im hoping there will be SOMETHING to make this all work out in two books. As for Kit, I knew there was something about him that had to be important since he has a POV. Once he started doing cool moves I was like okay this kid is the lost Herondale. And then Jem and Tessa come in and are awesome together. I really think Kit and Ty will be a thing because remember, far in the future Clare said The Wicked Powers will be about two gay shadowhunters in love and I have a feeling it will be about them. There is a big emphasis on family in this, and I love it. Exploring Julian and Marks relationship, their roles have essentially reversed. When Mark was taken, he was the older one in charge who knew how to take care of the kids. Now, his time in Faerie has made him forget how to care for them and be stern with them, thats Julians role now. You can see they really love each other, but Julian gets frustrated by Mark and how hes not how he expected him to be which is sad. That whipping scene! Oh man, broke my heart. I sobbed. And then with that last chapter things will clearly not get better. Oh Mark, you just had to say it. And Emma may just go through with it because its not like she can explain why she wants a pretend boyfriend and ughh this is not gonna go well. Everyone has such unique personalities, but they all work together so well. Things I want exploredanswered: More knowledge on the parabatai thing, MORE JEM AND TESSA we barely saw them and I was hoping they would be more involved with Emma and co., Dianas secrets, Cristinas history and past with Diego and Jaime, mental illness among shadowhunters, Kit and his perhaps budding friendship with Ty, how Livvy will feel about this, and the aftermath of that Why lie? and epilogue. I just knew that epilogue was gonna happen, I knew it! Also, I refuse to believe Malcolm is dead until I see the body. Honestly, I think what you realize the most above all is that for the Blackthorns and Emma, family is everything. Oh, one more thing! THAT SPECIAL STORY AT THE END. SIMON AND IZZY ARE ENGAGED!!!! MY BABIES ARE OKAY!!!!! JACE PROPOSED TO CLARY BUT WE DONT KNOW IF SHE WILL SAY YES!!! Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Clares writing is spectacular and the characters are amazing. I still love TID the most, but who knows I may change my mind yet. Damn this is a long review... so sorry guys lol. Oh I almost forgot. Mark, youre a book boyfriend.
What is infinite? The universe and the greed of men. I really, really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it and thats all I really ask for from a book like this. Leigh Bardugo was great at developing her world, I felt like it was real as she had worked out how social interactions occurred, how the government worked and also added in some history. Yet something about her prose of writing just didnt really connect with me on a deep level. Thats really the only reason I didnt give this book 5 stars. I felt like Bardugos writing was always on the surface and never went deep enough for me personally. But dont get me wrong, I still appreciated Bardugos writing, which was in some points quite beautiful. It is because I love him that I will not let him put himself beyone redemption. My favorite part of this book was the Darkling. I do not necessarily like him, but I sure do find him interesting. I found myself quickly turning pages just to get more insight into him as a character. It was disappointing that we never got much of an insight, but I remember this is a first of three books. If I get a good insight into his past and feel like I know him on a deep level by the end of the series, I will be very pleased. Sometimes I wish this book was told from his perspective. I do really love and respect Alinas character, but I find the Darkling is so unique and intriguing that to be able to see the world through his eyes and understand his thoughts would be a lot more interesting. I wonder sometimes how much we really understand our own gifts. The Darkling was definitely the highlight of this book for me, and a huge part of why I enjoyed it so much. I like when I read a book and think ill never read anything very similar to this again and thats how I feel about the Darkling. I think what really helped make this story interesting was that there was a lot of external plot to keep the story moving. I never felt like Alina had much control over where the story went, which I really like when reading. It makes it feel like there is an actual story going on outside of the characters. And theres nothing wrong with being a lizard either. Unless you were born to be a hawk. There was action at appropriate times and I often felt suspense and worry. The story only felt flat towards the middle of the book, although I was never bored. I also liked that a lot was always happening and I never felt like scenes were dragging on for too long. It was sharp and to the point, without wasting time on pointless scenes or dialogue. I think this was really influenced by Bardugos great understanding of her own world and her creativity. She always had new ideas to place into the plot so that it never got stagnant. I personally felt like this was a very well planned and structured story. I want to comment on Mal. I quite liked how his character was set up at the beginning of the book. His relationship at the orphanage with Alina was set up really nicely with a lot of imagery. It set up this sad but sweet childhood relationship. The way he behaved whilst being in the army was also interesting. But the second half of the book I felt like he fell into the trap of a typical male love interest. I found his character and relationship with Alina honestly typical. It felt deep at the beginning, but those feelings I had just sort of faded when it got a bit too cliche for me. His dialogue felt very scripted and hard to believe. Now this may have occurred because I found the connection Alina had with the Darkling fascinating. I never really knew if it was chemistry or some deeper form of connection that was enforced due to their powers. I liked feeling clueless and left guessing. I guess since this relationship was so unique, the idea of Alina and Mal just felt exaggeratedly typical next to it. I think because this book had such an interesting story I was not too invested in the romance and overall, this did not really bother me. Its rare for me to not really care who the leading female ends up with in the end, thats usually my biggest concern. I love Alina as a character and am just really interested in her finding her own inner peace and using her powers to the best of her abilities. This was what I had been born for. I would never let anyone separate me from it again. I think it was Alinas humble, down to earth personality that I loved. I liked that she was able to accept her own faults, was honest with herself and was kind but mature to those around her, with a little quirk and sarcasm here and there. Lastly I would like to comment on my other favorite part of this book. I liked how this book centered around the idea of belonging to someone and feeling like you have a place in the world. Alinas feelings of loneliness, isolation and desperation to belong somewhere were actually quite relateable. In an individualistic society, it is quite easy to feel isolated and unwanted, and the idea of pleasing and belonging to someone, particularly someone powerful and attractive, is unfortunately somehow comforting. So for a book to touch on something like this, that people often experience in our world, was a personally moving thing to read about. It gave this story depth and a purpose behind the story itself. As I said, if I had connected on a deeper level with Bardugos writing style, I would have given this book 5 stars. In this genre of young adult fiction, this is one of the best Ive read so far and cannot wait to pick up the sequel! The problem with wanting... is that it makes us weak.
Occult scholar Dr. John Montague rents Hill House for the summer after hearing of the strange occurrences that happened there. No family has been able to stay in house for more than a few days at a time. Even though they give a wide range of excuses, Dr. Montague believes they do this simply because its unfeasible to a rational person to say that some unknown fear drove them out. The only thing the families agree on is that no one should set foot in Hill House. Hill House is an eightyyearold mansion built by a man named Hugh Crain, and there has never been a moments peace for anyone since it was built. Violent deaths, family squabbles, and suicide taint its brief history. Dr. Montague invites guests to stay at Hill House with him to help him track any phenomena. These guests are all chosen for their connection to strange events. Only two end up taking him up on his offer. Eleanor Vance, a fragile, socially awkward woman who had an experience with a poltergeist as a young girl, and Theodora no last name, a freespirited woman who has exhibited psychic tendencies. The last person to join them is Luke Sanderson, a charming rake who represents the family who owns the property. Despite their different lifestyles and personalities, the four form quick friendships with one another. The group begins to experience strange occurrences in Hill House with Eleanor being the most receptive to what is happening around them as she increasingly loses grip with reality. Theres some evidence to suggest that the event she witnessed during her childhood might actually have been some supernatural doing of her own that she is unaware of, a doing that may have followed her to Hill House. I can only vaguely remember watching The Haunting with Liam Neeson, Catherine ZetaJones, Owen Wilson, and Lili Taylor, and Ive never watched the original one from the 60s. So, I didnt have much movie lore to taint the book for me other than having images of Taylor as Eleanor Vance, Wilson as Luke Sanderson, and ZetaJones as Theodora. Liam Neeson did not fit the image of Dr. Montague, but I think I remember them calling him by another last name in the movie, anyway. Ive been a horror book and movie fan for a very long time. For quite a number of years read: most of my preteen, teenage, and young adult years horror was about the only thing I would read with the occasional read from other genres. The first horror novel that I can remember leaving an impression with me as a preteen was Stephen Kings It. Sure, I had read other horror books, mostly in the YA vein, during that time. However, even as a preteen, I was a bit numbed to the scary aspects of horror books, and I remember It being the moment when a whole new world of horror opened up for me. However, two subgenres of horror were never really my cuppazombie horror and ghost stories. Even though ghost stories arent high on my list that doesnt stop me from reading them. I just found that most ghost stories never really got any better than your average 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey books. Enjoyable, fun reads, but kind of campy. Sure, there have been exceptions as always, but most of them read like the kind of urban legends youd whisper to your friend. Hey, did you hear the story about the cheerleader who died on the football field and now her ghost will chase you if you stand on the 50yard line at midnight? Yeah, that. Ive always been more into the macabre, anyway. So, I went into The Haunting of Hill House expecting it to be kitschy. This is a ghost story, but it manages to be more than just a story thats told around the camp fires. Jackson brought a psychological angle that makes the reader question if these things are really happening to this bunch or if it is some unexplainable shared delusion. Maybe Eleanor made the whole thing up entirely. We learn early in the novel that she has a very ripe imagination that threatens to overflow. This imagination may be the consequence of taking care of her ailing mother for years before her death and never having much contact with others. Jackson spends a fair amount of time delving into Eleanors thoughts with poetic prose that can sometimes make you forget that youre reading a horror novel. At the same time, that same poetic writing can suddenly be twisted by Jackson to capture the eerie, dreadful feel of Hill House. It creates tension and scares that seem to be hidden just out of the corner of your eye. I wouldnt say this book is necessarily scary, but it creates a fair mount of tension for the characters that they never really shake as the house seeds itself deep in their psyche. Jackson never takes the mystery out of the story, leaving so much of the happenings at Hill House up to the reader, which makes the mind run wild. Add to that the caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, who both are depressing, dour people that help feed the groups edginess. I should take some time out here to praise the narrator, Bernadette Dunne. Her raspy reading voice helped to accentuate the creepiness of the story, but she did an excellent job creating voices and personality for the characters through her voice as well. I dont think this would have been quite as enjoyable without her narration of the story. I loved hearing her Mrs. Dudley, who was probably the most terrifying and the funniest person in the book for me partly because of these lines delivered so well by Ms. Dunne: I leave before dark comes ... We live over in the town, six miles away. So there wont be anyone around if you need help. We couldnt even hear you, in the night. No one could. No one lives any nearer than the town. No one else will come any nearer than that. In the night, Mrs. Dudley said, and smiled outright. In the dark, she said, and closed the door behind her. This is part of a much longer mantra that Mrs. Dudley recites repeatedly throughout the novel to the characters. She rarely says much else aside from these same words, and Dunnes delivery really cuts down to the bone with those words. Side note: If our small theater ever puts on a production of The Haunting of Hill House, I would so try out for Mrs. Dudleys part. The Haunting of Hill House is a tense story that seems to ask if the house is truly haunted or could these things have happened because the group believed in them. Would they have been faced with this same terror if they hadnt had certain expectations about what to expect or is the house truly some primordial evil waiting and watching for victims? Its almost as if the story is asking the reader, What do you think... in the night... in the dark? Read more reviews at The BiblioSanctum.
Reviewed by Willow  Donna  5 Stars I think the fact that I misjudged him pisses me off more than the fact that he cheated on me. If I cant even accurately judge the people closest to me, then I cant trust anyone. Ever. I hate them from taking that away from me. Now, no matter who comes into my life after this, Ill always be skeptical. Donna: Well what can I say, can Colleen write a bad book? Well the answer is a big fat resounding no!! I totally and utterly adored this book. It made me happy and sad, made me cry buckets but it took me on an amazing emotional journey that I will not forget in a hurry and made my mascara run and run and run. Willow: I will admit that this book had the ice queen melting  yes it did have me crying quite alot too. Colleen is an amazing writer, it is so effortless reading her words and she really makes you feel every single one. Ridge has been trying to write songs for his brother and their band, but is having writers block. Seeing Sydney from across the court yard connecting to his music and creating lyrics for them, Ridge realises he needs her help. With the betrayal Sydney has just faced, she now has no home and no job. Ridge comes up with a solution that helps Sydney and gets her helping him write the songs that he needs. With this book you get the added bonus of the free soundtrack. I think that having the music linked to Colleens and Griffins written words adds a whole new level to the book, whilst I didnt listen to all the sound track whilst reading, I can certainly see that adds so much more of an experience to the book. Donna: Yes music and words always go hand in hand and in the book it was the way in which Sydney and Ridge communicated the most honestly. It was during these interactions that Colleen had my heart melting. It was beautiful to read and I always felt as if I was there watching them make beautiful music together that is literally, get your minds outta the gutter lol! Willow: lol! The sessions where they were writing together really felt intimate and I felt like I was intruding on these beautiful moments.The book isnt all hearts and flowers though, there is cheating in this book and a lot of heart ache too, and these were the moments that really had me crying. I could feel the pain emanating off the pages! Donna: Ridge does have a long term girlfriend called Maggie. I wouldnt have said it was cheating between Sydney and Ridge though, they had a stolen kiss but stopped it going further. You really felt his inner turmoil surrounding his feelings regarding Maggie and what he felt for her. I couldnt help but be affected and as I said before was living through the angst with him. As much as I wanted Sydney and Ridge to be together I understood his relationship with Maggie and didnt want anything bad to happen either. I really was in a catch22 situation. Ridge with Maggie: I spend the next half an hour reminding myself how much Ive missed her. I remind myself how much I love her. I remind myself how good it feels when were together. I keep reminding myself over and over, because for the past week, it felt as if I was starting to forget. Willow: The situation Sydney and Ridge were in was a difficult one. They obviously were developing feelings for one another and this was clearly shown through their music, but Ridge clearly loves Maggie, and thats the difficulty for the reader, Maggie is not some bitch girlfriend, she is a nice girl, that as much as you try, you cant help but like too! I did really feel for her, and wondered how would she feel if she found out what whats happening between Sydney  Ridge, no matter how much Ridge was trying to hold back and respect Maggies feelings. I was totally torn though, wishing that Sydney would get her Maybe Someday with Ridge. Im also thankful that she appears to have more will power than I do, because whenever Im around her, Ive never felt so weak. Donna: I was the same, I really felt the pain, anguish, conflict and turmoil. I did feel that there was something hidden with his relationship with Maggie and was glad when we did eventually get more of the back story as that did help somewhat in trying to get my head around the situation. Maggie was an extremely strong woman, despite what life had thrown at her and was glad that when all was said and done she could be objective and see the bigger picture Willow: The fact that Colleen wrote Maggie as a beautiful, nice, kindhearted girl packs much more of a punch in my opinion. The reader cannot find fault with her, cannot find a reason to blame her or justify why Ridge would develop feelings for someone else. As much as I would like it to be true, I personally dont believe that there is just one person, one soul mate for you. I believe that you may have more than one love through out your life, maybe this love will change as you grow as a person, or are faced with different situations, but that does not diminish the love you felt before or for someone else and I think that is it great that this book reflects that. Donna: I totally agree, I believe that the love he felt for Maggie was totally different than the love he felt for Sydney. Whilst both all encompassing and he struggled, I am like you and believe that you can get that chance to love more than one. It just sucked that they both came along at the same time but the sweet was that it a it was present in the first place and b I think it all worked out perfectly in the end, despite everything. For her I bend, for you I break. I have to say that I also loved Warren, Ridges flat mate, he deserves a book too! Willow: Yes Warren added a brilliant bit of humour to the book. He was looking out for Ridge, Sydney  Maggie all together trying to ensure that no one was left with too much pain. Will Ridge  Sydney get their Maybe Someday? There isnt a doubt in my mind that we could be perfect for each others life, Sydney. Its that our lives arent perfect for us We will leave you to find out but we cant go without mentioning that there is a twist to this story, but it is a spoiler so we cant say what, but if what we have already said isnt enough for you, this twist totally adds to the whole story. Donna: Yes, there is a definite twist, not one that I have encountered before and it made this book so much more! I cant wait for everyone to read it and savour, live and breathe every single word. This is not a book to be skimmed. It should be read slowly, savoured and devoured! You wont be disappointed, it truly is a work of art. It is my tied number one read so far this year! Willow: A totally beautiful book! Beat, beat, pause. Beat, beat, pause. Beat, beat, pause. Its absolutely beautiful. The way it sounds is beautiful. The way it cares is beautiful. The way it loves is beautiful. He presses his lips to the top of my head. I close my eyes...and I cry.
I am still reeling from the perfection that was this book. One of Us is Lying is a refreshing take on the YA contemporarymystery, loosely inspired by The Breakfast Club, but with a hint of murder, scandals, and romance. This remarkably wellwritten novel has fast become one of the best books I have read so far this year. When five teenagers are given detention for having phones in class, they expect only another boring day at school: Bronwyn, the brain, is bound for Yale and never breaks the rules; Addy, the beauty, has a pictureperfect boyfriend and is the future homecoming queen; Cooper, the jock, is the allstar baseball player on the fasttrack to any scholarship he wants; Nate, the criminal, is on probation for dealing; and Simon, the outcast, is hated by almost everyone at school for his gossip app that has ruined lives and driven one girl to attempt suicide. Five teenagers go into that classroom ... but only four come out. Before the end of detention, Simon is dead. According to the police, it was murder, and whats even worse is that Simon was planning on releasing the lifealtering secrets of all four of his fellow detentionees  which makes them all suspects in his murder. Did they really do it ... or are they being set up by a killer that still on the loose? When starting this novel, I fully expected that there would be a few issues in regards to the perspectives  four POVs is a lot for a short novel, and absurdly difficult to pull off. But McManus did it! And not just adequately, but perfectly. I fell in love with Bronwyn, Nate, Addy and Cooper, and the thought that one of them might be lying physically hurt me. I havent connected with this many characters at the same time since Six of Crows . All I wanted to do was protect each of them, and every time one of them was questioned by police, I was practically sick to my stomach with worry. I know I sound like an overbearing parent, but I really felt for them! While these characters stem from high school stereotypes jock, nerd, bad boy, mean girl, the tropes placed on them are wonderfully subverted as each character goes through some intense development. In just 360 pages, McManus delves deep into the lives of four completely different teenagers as the come to terms with a traumatic event, and allows them to learn and change for the better. She does this with all four characters  I know some authors who struggle with intricate character development for just one character! You could even say One of Us is Lying works as a Bildungsroman in a sense, as each character grows exponentially. I believe that almost every reader will be able to emotionally connect with at least one of these characters. I saw parts of myself in each of the four characters and have no doubt others will view themselves in them too. Bronwyn is the highachiever; you know that nerd who sits at the front of the classroom, answers every question, and sucks up to the teacher? i.e. me. While Bronwyn is considered the brains of the little group that forms after the media and classmates turn against the four, she grows as a person and comes to the realisation that her future, while still important, is not worth everything. Due to her sisters illness and her Latino fathers struggle to become successful, Bronwyn puts a lot of pressure upon herself to be the best and make her parents proud. I really felt for her and admired her strength and intellect. Nate is the drug dealer and the resident bad boy. His bipolar mother disappeared years ago and his father copes by drinking himself into a stupor, leaving Nate to act like the adult and pay the bills. While Nate begins the novel acting like, well, a criminal, as the story develops, we see another side to Nate: a caring side, a sweet side; he doesnt have much love in his life, but he craves it more than he wants to admit. Nate also starts a relationship with one of the other characters, and I shipped it from the very moment I sensed the author going in that direction. I cant even begin to explain how much I loved these two characters together. Yall know Im a sucker for a bad boy, so no surprises when I loved him. I absolutely adored Cooper. The novels most popular boy in school and the best player on the baseball team, Cooper should come across as a typical jock, but he is one of two characters who goes through the most compelling character development. The best way to describe him is that he is the epitome of a genuine good guy: he cares for people and he stands by someone when they go through hell. He also harbours a deep secret that tugged on my heart strings. Im so glad McManus developed his character this way, because this particular issue is still considered very taboo for those in the sportworld. Theres not enough positive representation, and I send a big thank you to McManus for opening this discussion. If anyone were to ask me why I cried when reading this book, it was because of the new love of my life: Addy. At the beginning of the novel, Addy is this robot of a girlfriend  like the ultimate Stepford Wife. Her boyfriend practically dictates her life, her mother is obsessed with having a man to take care of her and has drummed that into Addy, and she only cares for her looks and her beautiful blonde hair. But that changes after her secret is revealed. Like Cooper, Addy goes through some of the best development I have seen in a long time, and I felt like a proud Mama bear by the end of the novel. Addy is an angel sent from heaven with purple hair. I adore her. One of Us is Lying has an incredibly fastpaced storyline, rich with intrigue and suspense. I read the novel in one sitting  I even stayed awake till 2 a.m. just to finish it. I used to be a massive Crime fiction aficionado, so I can usually guess the ending of a novel. In fact, I would put my odds at 910 times. But in this case, I could not pick out the murderer for the life of me  and when we find out the answer, it will blow you away. I literally took notes as to who I thought the real killer was and what their potential motive could be, and was still completely wrong! This book also talks about many sensitive issues, mainly diversity and mental health, and treats them with respect while also opening up a dialogue for further discourse. I also wanted to quickly point out that many people are comparing this book to Pretty Little Liars , and while there are some similarities, the teens in this book are so much smart than PLL : for one, they dont discuss their problems in the middle of a public space; two, they actively try to figure out who the killer is; and three, they take many precautions as opposed to the PLL who literally make the stupidest decisions ever. McManus writing was topnotch and I still cant believe this is a debut novel, because it certainly doesnt read like one. Each characters voice was individual and in tune with how teenagers think and feel in reality. Its so easy to get swept up into the story, which is probably why I read the book so quickly. I wish I could go back and savour the novel properly; Ill just have to settle for a reread instead. One of Us is Lying is already 2017s best YA mystery  Im calling it. Its true. I cannot find a fault with the novel and I had a genuinely fun, if sometimes frantic, reading experience. I cant wait for McManus next novel  Ill be keeping a watchful eye out for her from now on.

We are The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Club, to know more about this book, go to the post in our website: White Hot Kiss The Dark Elements, 1 by Jennifer L. Armentrout If you are interested, you can visit our website: The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Club The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Clubs Review: Rate: 5 stars Review: Recently I had the pleasure to enter to the new magical world that Jennifer L. Armentrout wrote thanks to Lisa from Harlequin Teen. And I am more than grateful, because Ms. Armentrout is an amazing writer and she proves it once again with White Hot Kiss. Not only she created an amazing story worth of a series of books that would leave you wanting for more, but a dark and dangerous romance, forbidden love, an adventure that if they fail it would set loose the Apocalypse and an unbelievable, heartbreaking and astonishing ending. White Hot Kiss has the very signature of Ms. Armentrout, because it reminded me a little bit of the Lux Series, but not quite the same. Well, not at all. In this series, the gargoyles who protect the humans from the demons. But these past years, the increase of demons in the human world made the gargoyles go public. Layla works with the wardens, also her family, marking demons for them to make their work easier. Meeting Roth in the process was not planned. He turns her world up side down and makes her doubt everything she knew. However, what started as a job for Roth and a merely curiosity for Layla turns out to be a dangerous path that could destroy everything. Laylas world is dark, intense, dangerous and simply addictive. I was addicted with her story from the very first page and didnt want to finish it. The story has the two perfects factions of good and evil: wardens and demons. However, throughout the story, theres a point when those lines are blurred and the author makes you doubt in which side you are really on. Jennifer L. Armentrouts characters are simply amazing. The main character, Layla is one of Armentrouts heroines, but with a dark side. Being part demon and part warden is not easy and the character has some difficult moments that made her be kind of insecure and doubt everything. Despite this, shes also funny and has a peculiar humor that made me laugh all the time. Plus her badass side brought a little action in the perfect situations. Roth is the perfect representation of a bad guy: he is dangerous, badass and has this Iamalwaysright attitude characteristic from other famous bad boys like Klaus Mikaelson and Damon Salvatore. Even if you always like more the good guy, Roth will steal your heart. He always reminds Layla what hes, but he has some sweet moments that shows us that he really cares for Layla and that simply melt my heart. Zaynes the good boy in this love triangle. Hes shown as that boy next door that always takes care of the girl, protecting her like a brother. And that simply makes the girl fall, head over heels, for him. Since Layla and Zayne grew up together, they are like brothers, have this great connection and chemistry that is only shown in a couple thats comfortable around each other. Despite this, Im simply glad that Layla was not hitting on her brother. That would be beyond awkward. But I wouldnt mind having a brother like Zayne you know what I mean wink, wink. I would venture to say that Zayne, Roth and Layla are one of my favorite love triangles, not only for its level of hotness and great chemistry, but because they are simply epic. One one hand we have the good Zayne, trying to protect and save Layla all the time. Hes the golden boy. As for Roth, hes the bad guy who turns out to be good after all, but without denying what he really is. I liked the fact that he warns Layla about being soulless and because of that he cannot feel love. The impossible love, plus the forbidden touch because of Roth being a demon, was one of the main reasons that made me choose Roth over Zayne. The story has a good plot and the unraveling secrets that we get to know while reading Laylas discovers are shocking as well as new for the readers. Not at all expected, and thats one of the things that makes the reader addicted to know more. As for the paranormal touch in White Hot Kiss, I would have never imagined to have such a crush on both demons and wardens, but I have it now. The author brings dangerous, good and sexy together and with a slightly Supernatural TV Show touch creating a paranormal story in which the fate of the world is involved. Finishing White Hot Kiss was the hardest part for me. Not that it was difficult because it was bad, but because I didnt want it to end. And saying that it broke my heart to read those last chapters, is not nearly enough to the actual heartbreaking I felt. I like that about Jennifers story: always the unexpected can happen and those situations that you think no, thats too cruel to happen it does. So, I would only say that she left a big open finale that would make The Dark Elements fans scream for the second book. Am I one of those fans? How do you dare question that. Of course, I am! Jennifer L. Armentrout has the great ability to swoon readers and captivate them with her stories and The Dark Elements is simply a reminder of that. With new mindblowing characters and an incredible story that would leave you speechless, White Hot Kiss not only was an incredible and epic read, it exceeded my expectations. And the only thing that would be left in White Hot Kiss would a warning sign: Warning, this story might be addictive. I highly recommend this book, as in leaveeverythingyouredoingandstartnow, and thats one of the main reasons White Hot Kiss won a welldeserved five gorjuss dolls. Dream Cast: Alex Pettyfer as Zayne Claire Holt as Layla Jordan Legault as Roth
Okay, I admit it  I went into this novel thinking Id hate the epistolary format. Having just finished Maggie Stiefvaters The Dream Thieves, I really didnt expect for this book to hold my attention while I waited for Blue Lily, Lily Blue to come in from the library. I guess I had a lot of preconceived notions about epistolary novels, some of which were given fuel by reviews Ive read on Goodreads. Mostly, though, I was just afraid to try something new. Welp. I was wrong. So, so wrong. Its not often that I say this about a book, but oh my goodness, I loved Illuminae. LOVED. In fact, I think Illuminae has slapped me with my worst book hangover of 2015. I feel bad that I went into this story thinking Id dislike it for its differences from more traditional novels, especially because thats exactly why I enjoyed it so much. At the risk of being extremely basic, here are some of Illuminaes main and imo, most compelling plot points: SPACE COMPUTER HACKERS A BADASS HEROINE and heroes SWOONY LOVE AI WITH QUESTIONABLE SANITY ... Zombies? NonSpoilery Summary: Illuminae is a series of files which mainly focus on characters named Kady Grant and Ezra Mason. Set on two different spaceships fleeing a corporation which has brutally attacked Kady and Ezras home planet, Kerenza, the story bounces between several settings and characters in order to fully explain events. Using audio transcriptions, instant messages, surveillance footage, AI narration, and even vivid illustrations the rose was my favorite, Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff created a novel that is totally unique in both plot and format. As the files unfold, so does the story of our main characters, particularly Kady. A badass computer hacker who is witty, sarcastic, and brave, Kady is a fantastic character to follow and root for  even when everything falls apart. What I loved spoilers hidden: Honestly, I loved just about everything. From the very beginning Illuminae runs at breakneck speed, but that momentum never sacrifices character or plot development like some other novels do. Kaufman and Kristoff deftly incorporate a delicate love story, an entire fleet of commanders with questionable morality, bloodthirsty victims of a horrific attack, TWO spaceships, and a ticking clock throughout the novel that had me gripping the book with actual fear and DISTRESS. I had to read Illuminae with the lights on, because honestly, so much of it is either heartracing or straightup scary. Against my expectations, I also deeply connected with the characters. Kady Grant is a badass computer hacker YES, a girl hacker!!!, and Ezra Mason is an absolutely lovable jock and Cyclone pilot I thought of Cyclones like Gundams. At first I found their love story a little unbelievable, especially considering that they lost everything to a horrible attack on their home planet. But Ezra and Kady have incredibly strong voices, and as their connection to one another unfolded, it became impossible for me not to connect with them. Through instant messages they work together and come together, rebuilding a relationship that was broken by a secret in Ezras past. Along with Ezra theres also Byron Zhang, a computer hacker whos more or less trained Kady. The instant messages between Zhang and Ezra give readers a platform to understand all characters and their voices. We also get extra insight into Kady from journal entries, which I think really endeared me to her. Kady has lost almost everything, yet shes still willing and able to fight for what little she has left. As the story unfolds, its obvious that Kady is an unstoppable character. I loved that about her, from beginning to end. Illuminae asks a lot of the reader, and I thought of it like a puzzle. As you read you get hints and clues, and you have to guess and work to piece information together just like the characters are doing. I really enjoyed that. I especially liked the incorporation of the Artificial Intelligence, AIDAN. AIDAN, which commits horrible acts in the name of protecting the fleet is an incredible complex character in the novel. Just like Kady, readers have to figure out whether or not its become insane from critical damage, or if its ability to selfrepair has maintained its supposed ability to remain absolutely logical. There is so much danger in this story from beginning to end: an imminent attack on our two main ships, the Alexander and Hypatia, looms throughout the book; refugees aboard one ship become increasingly ill until they devolve into the Afflicted; AIDAN is considered insane and dangerous, yet shutting it down ensures that the Alexander has no defense mechanisms; Ezra Mason is throttled into space to battle enemies; Kady and Byron try desperately to hack AIDAN and save everyone they can. Through all of that, though, I never lost sight of the core of the story: Kady Grant wants to save the one person she loves, and she wants to make the refugees from her planet safe again. On a different note, I realized something whilst reading Illuminae: this books format is totally accessible to people who dont enjoy reading. When my husband not an avid reader unless it involves sports : saw me reading it, he was so intrigued by the spaceship illustrations, the creative AI narration, and the instant messages. As a former teacher, that made me think about the students I had that didnt like reading for various reasons. I think Illuminae, which feels sort of like a hybrid between a graphic novel and a traditional novel, could really draw in readers who either struggle with reading or maintaining interest in books. That made me really excited, and I hope this book lays the groundwork for more like it. What I wasnt crazy about: My main concern about the epistolary format was that it would distance me too far from the characters, setting, and plot. And to be honest, it did at first. Illuminae requires major suspension of disbelief, especially because it mercilessly throws readers into the world from page 1. Since this novel is told through a series of documents, it also requires patience. Nothing is given away if it isnt necessary, and as a reader you have to be ready for some confusion and cliffhanging while you read. This took some getting used to for me, but I ended up loving it within the first 100 pages. And let me just say: I really loved how this format threw out plot twists. SO GOOD. I had conflicted feelings about the Afflicted  people who suffered a biochemical attack and developed into terrifying, zombielike shells of themselves. Murderous, smart, and capable of hunting in packs, the Afflicted serve as a HUGE horrortension builder. I understand that theyre an example of how ruthless and evil the corporation, BeiTech, truly is. I also think they were an interesting example of the dangerous wartactics employed by the intergalactic world Kady and Ezra inhabit. So knowing all that, I get why their presence is necessary for the story. I guess for me they felt a little clunky since theres so much action already. I think even without the Afflicted, Illuminae would be a crazy edgeofyourseat read. That said, I get why theyre included, and they certainly didnt make me enjoy the book any less. TLDR; This was literally me during most of the book except for when I was cryinggroaninginternally screaming: I think Illuminae has everything: action, adventure, heartbreak, blinding plot twists, and characters you can cheer for from beginning to end. Please give this novel a try. Its interesting, its different, and its honestly my favorite book of 2015. And I mean, who doesnt like an actionpacked story set in space? I cant wait for the next book in this series! 2016 is going to be an awesome year for sequels.
I just read this, July 2015, but wrote this review a couple years ago, and pretty much hold to my views then, in spite of the fact that after first reading this book and loving it, I read each of his previous books and liked them less and less. I basically think he is a pretty good technical writer, smart, loves language, but until this book did not find an important subject to write about. Before this book he was mostly just clever without a real important purpose. His characters all sound like Green himself, smart, literary, and sarcastic, though he can be touching, too. Gus and Hazel sound alike, but they still seem compelling to me. They are smarter than teenagers typically are, by far, prep school kids, but I like what they have to say still. Another thing: I think Greens main influence in his writing of this story is Peter DeVriess masterpiece about pediatric cancer, The Blood of the Lamb, which is better than Fault, but has that same mashup of bitterness and sardonic humor and vulnerability. I highly recommend that one, too. This is the October 29, 2012 review: How do you write a book about kids with cancer and not fall into certain traps? For instance, how do you avoid sentimentality, being maudlin, being inspirational, etc? Of course, most people LOVE these aspects of books about stories of death, they like to weep, they need hope, etc. I dont want to dismiss those human tendencies, of course. And for some, the sappier the better! But what if you gag on that sickly sweet sap? A host of books attempt to answer this question from a more literary and philosophical point of view, and a problem not easily solved. Dave Eggers took on the problem in his memoir, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, about the sudden and completely outoftheblue deaths from cancer of his two parents, that left him, a college student, to raise his younger brother alone. Do you cry? Sure, but in the process he grapples seriously with the issue of how to tell the tale without becoming the hero he does not feel he really is. How do you avoid this? Well, he goes meta on us, he talks about the issue with us frankly, and he undermines his own potential heroism so courageous! How could he possibly live with so much grief and responsibility at such a young age?!! by making himself out to also be a selfish jerk at times, bitter, clueless. He laughs at himself, he gets angry at himself and the world, and everything. Greg Michies story of his urban teaching, Holler if You Hear Me, works in a similar way to show us how he fails all the time as a teacher... which ironically for both Michie and Eggers actually increases our sympathy for them as heroes....they GET points for being courageous by undermining this very claim about fearful and uncourageous they really are! But I like the move, and their honesty and UNsentimentality increases their credibility. Green is an often very very good writer, who takes on Eggerss charge to try at all costs to avoid sentimentality, in the service of TRUE sentiment, to get at the core of the really important emotions and ideas working this enterprise we all have to face and face again and again in various ways: death. How does he pull it off? With many strategies; one is wit which is also the title of a one woman play about a woman with cancer, where the choice of to laugh or to cry is an easy one for Green. He does rage as his characters rage, but he is inclined to find a way to laugh when he can, and the darker the joke, the better, though these jokes also sometimes set up tender scenes, too. He creates teen and adult characters who are so smart and so witty and so cynical and so deeply insightful that the sap dries up almost everywhere well, not everywhere, but give him a break, the death from cancer of teens is a tough challenge for even a cynical writer and he is not that cynical, finally. There are other books like this: Cancer Vixen, Cancer Made Me Shallower, others... I heard a comic with cancer talking on NPR about how she did standup the night she had gotten a diagnosis that her cancer had returned... tough, and funny. And the mainstream stories are really about faith, about not giving up, about courage, and while all cancer books do deal with these issues in one way or the other, most of Greens characters are agnostic, existentialist, sometimes but rarely bitter, and usually accepting of death as just part of life. They hate the idea of being inspired by their cancer. They hate cancer perks and false hopes. One central and dearly lovable character, Augustus, does seem to believe in Something, and hopes to come back to visit his funeral, but Green is not taking a position on that, he is himself smartassedly existentialist, though not a grim one; he admires his kid characters for their commitment to just going on. As Beckett says it, through I think Molloy: I cant go on, Ill go on. Maybe some folks wont like Green as much as Beckett, and I dont, but they have similar purposes: How to face oblivion and the short time we have on the planet usefully. So yes, spoiler alert, people do die in this book, and you do cry, and yes, you admire the courage and wit and smart assed humor and insight of him and his characters, but you also admire Green himself for writing so beautifully. He really is a good writer, and he supports great human beings over terrible ones. This is YA at its very best, and deserves all the accolades it can get, in my opinion. As he has Augustus, one of the central characters say, The real heroes arent the people doing things, they real heroes are the people NOTICING things, the ones paying attention. Hes talking about Hazel Grace, our main character, but hes also talking about writers, artists, human beings at their best. Here is Green talking in a meta way to other writers what writing can and must do. I cried reading this book, but sometimes it was just because his writing was so deft, so wonderful, it occasionally took my breath away. That last book that did for me for me to cry about great writing was also YA, Okay for Now, by Gary Schmidt, which also very much endorses the importance of art in teen and generally, human identity and sensemaking. I think Schmidts book is better, actually, more affecting, even, but I still like Green in this book. One thing Hazel Grace, the agnostic, says, hanging in a park with her family, reconsidering Augustuss possible view of faith against a favorite writer Peter VanHoutens cynical despair: Who am I to say that these things might not be forever? Who is Peter VanHouten to assert as fact the conjecture that our labor is temporary? All I know of heaven and all I know of earth is in this park: an elegant universe in ceaseless motion, teeming with ruined ruins and screaming children. Green throughout the book also uses the playing of video games one kind of storytelling to mirror his view of what uses fiction and storytelling can contribute to a good life: paying attention. I cried when Hazel Grace recited poetry to Augustus, even the spare William Carlos Williamss The Red Wheelbarrow: so much dependsupona red wheelbarrowglazed with rainwaterbeside the whitechickens. You are only on the planet so long; pay attention, pay attention, take care of each other.
There isnt much left to say about Stephen King that I havent already said in the past 60 reviews Ive done of his work. I put this collection off as long as I felt possible. I wanted to finish it before Hills The Fireman comes out tomorrow, and Kings End of Watch drops next month. But to tell the truth, fellow Constant Readers, I procrastinated as long as I did because... Im kinda scared. After Revival, I honestly doubt well see another standalone Stephen King novel. I will not repeat my reasoning, which I gave in my review of Finders Keepers, but I have a feeling King is saying goodbye. Mark my words, this will be the last collection well see from King. But believe me when I say, I will be thrilled if I am wrong. I didnt like every story, but the ones I did like balanced the ones I didnt, even out the score of the overall book. No collections perfect. Every good short story collection is an experiment meant to showcase an authors reach. It is a celebration of craft. And if every story is to everyones liking, the author has gone terribly wrong somewhere. This review will be long because I plan to spend a paragraph on every single story. So settle in or click away. If youre still here, lets rap. Mile 81 is the first tale and one of those rare King stories I did not read during its standalone release. I knew we had one final collection coming, and I didnt see the point in reading the few hed scattered out over the market like seed in a bird sanctuary. Let everyone else gobble them up. Ill wait for the entire loaf of bread, thank you very much. Yes, this is another killercar story. But whats really wrong with that? I didnt care much for Christine or From a Buick 8, but I liked this one very much. Premium Harmony is one of my favorite stories in this collection. It is King at his literary best. I hear people bitching about how Stephen King is a bad writer or how hes a horror writer for people who dont like horror and I wanna staple their privates to a merrygoround and spin, spin, spin... Stephen King might not be the best writer in the world but he is one of our greatest living storytellers, and many of his books are classics. This story is proof that hes not the onetrick pony so many people seem to think he is. Batman and Robin Have an Altercation is another story that flexes Kings literary muscle. Nothing horrifying about this story, other than how human beings sometimes treat each other. Loved the unfailing bond between father and son. Even with his mind half gone, pops took another stab at life. The Dune is one of those stories that all King fans will find familiar. It deals with the foretelling of death. There is, at my last count, four stories that tackle this subject in this collection alone, but the theme is a strong one throughout Kings career. Bad Little Kid is likely my favorite story in the entire collection. Enough said. A Death is one of only two stories in this collection which Id previously read. You can read my review of it HERE. The Bone Church is poetry. Stephen King is not the best poet. Morality is one of my favorite kinds of tales. What would you do for a lifechanging amount of money? There was a time in my life when I would have done what the lady in this story does. Not anymore. But only because I no longer need the money. Afterlife follows its title close enough that I dont think I need to discuss it any further. Although I must say, I really love the structure of this story. It just feels right. And this is coming from someone who doesnt believe in any form of life after death. Ur is a Dark Tower story not set in MidWorld. All things follow the path of the beam, and my nerdy little heart dug every path this story took. Special nod to Insomnia in this one as well. Herman Wouk is Still Alive feels like another author doing an impersonation of Stephen King. The little horrific details there at the end felt forced, and I liked the foreword more than the actual story. Under the Weather is predictable but morbid fun. Even if I knew where it was going, it was still entertaining getting there. Blockade Billy is a story about baseball. Not much else to say. King even says give it a chance in the foreword of this tale. I own the Cemetery Dance minihardcover of this one, but only because it was on clearance at BN for 3. The best part about that little hardcover? It has Morality as a special feature. Mister Yummy is another precursor of death story in the vein of The Dune and Obits, but I feel its closer to Bad Little Kid side of things. Its odd, which sometimes means the opposite of good in Kings hands thinking of The Tommyknockers and Dreamcatcher, but here it works. Nice nod to Hemingford Home herein. Tommy is probably the only poetry King has ever written that I didnt dislike. Drink to the motherfucker! The Little Green God of Agony hits close to home for me. It made me think of my own battles with pain and pain medicine, and my mothers knee replacements. Pain you cannot see is usually written off or flat out ignored by the very people who you seek help from. But, I will admit that, sometimes, its all in our heads. That Bus is Another World is another instance of King being weird and good at the same time. It doesnt happen often, but it happens here. Obits is the final precursor to death story. It is the longest and more original of the previous three like it, and my third favorite tale in the collection. Drunken Fireworks is the second of the two stories I had previously read. I reviewed it HERE. Summer Thunder is the final story, and like the forthcoming End of Watch, could very well herald the end of Kings multifaceted career. The story is about the end of the world, and is one hell of a heartbreaking tale. To end what could be his final collection with a story about the end of the world seems to be a sign of endings to come. Then again, I love reading too much into things. In summation: Here we are, at the end. This review should be taken as an invitation to converse about all things Stephen King. If you stuck around, meet me in the comments and well share stories. Whats your favorite King tale? Which novel is your favorite? Can you possibly pick just one? Final Judgment: A love letter to the shortstory format.
First of all, I loved this. Its probably one of my favorite releases of 2014. The writing was creative, funny, and engaging. I tried to savor it by reading slowly, but I couldnt. It was so captivating. This isnt going to be much of a review as much as all the things Ill loved about it. And its going to be filled with spoilers. And fangirling. Me after I finished the book: I love how Marissa Meyer ties all the stories together. This picks up just days after the end of Scarlet. Many are dead. Prince Kai has agreed to marry Queen Levana. Cinder is still a wanted criminal. Things arent looking good for the crew. The opening chapter is about Cress, the Rapunzel of the series. Her tower is a satellite. The witch is none other than the Queens thaumaturge, Sybil. I liked Cresss character, more than Scarlet but not as much as Cinder, because she is so kickass. One thing I love about these books are the skills the female characters have. Cinders a mechanic, Scarlets a pilot, and Cress is a hacker. Those arent your typical female professions, and that sets these characters apart. Cress is smart, but reserved, which makes sense, given the fact shes been living on a satellite for most of her life. I loved her resourcefulness. Cress and Thorne. I loved them. Not as much as Cinder and Kai, but close. They are so cute together! I like how Cress develops a crush on Thorne before ever meeting him, and she researched him to the point where she knows more about his past than he does. And although she is naive, Thorne also acknowledges that and takes care of her. Captain, she murmured. I think Im in love with you. An eyebrow shot up. She counted six beats of his heart before, suddenly, he laughed. Dont tell me it took you two whole days to realize that. I must be losing my touch. Her fingertips curled up against him. You knew? That youre lonely, and Im irresistible? Yeah. I knew. Come on, Cress, youre getting up. Do you think you could ever love me back? Cress, this is sweet, but arent I the first guy youve ever met? And his promise to Cress! One of my favorite parts: I guess its time. While Cresss thoughts continued to churn through the horrible things that could happen to her, she felt herself being suddenly spun around and dipped backward, a supportive arm scooping beneath her back. She yelped and caught herself on Thornes shoulder. Then he was kissing her. In the original Rapunzel, the prince falls out of her tower into a thorn bush and goes blind. The prince of our storys name is Thorne. How cruel is that? I thought Thorne going blind made him a lot more dependent on Cress, and so it was necessary to move their relationship along. I love how he needs her as a guide and how shes unhelpful when describing the scenery. Cress? Its beautiful out there. A hesitation, before, Could you be more specific? The sky is gorgeous, intense blue color. She pressed her fingers to the glass and traced the wavy hills on the horizon. Oh, good. Youve really narrowed it down for me. But, moving on to Cinder and Kai! I had been waiting a whole two books for their reunion, and it did not disappoint. I cant believe she shot him and kidnapped him. Its just such a Cinder thing to do. Their talk though...just. Kai can be a little slow. The entire time, I was thinking, come on Kai, when will you figure out that the princess is CINDER! Even when she was trying to tell him.... But when he finds out, and then she tells him about her eyes and her netscreen....they are just too adorable. Im honestly not a big fan of Scarlet and Wolf, so I didnt mind their lack of appearance in this book. Still, I hate that Scarlet was taken by the Lunars and I got so scared for her. The Lunar boy that abuses her is so messed up, Id hate to see him as an adult. We got to see Winter in this though! Im glad she took Scarlet under her care. She is really weird, but Im hoping she can pull herself together with the help of Scarlet to escape Levanas clutches in Winter. I really liked how Marissa Meyer gave us slight foreshadowing in the first book when Dr. Erland was talking about Lunars going crazy when they dont use their powers. Winter is a perfect example of that, and I think her mental instability is going to cause a lot of problems in the next book. I really want to get inside her head and get a back story for why she doesnt use her powers. The poor girl... Wolf just got on my nerves. I cant really blame him, because Scarlet was the only thing that made him more human. Without her hes just sad. Having him moping around and out of control definitely caused some unnecessary problems in this book. Who else saw Cress being Dr. Erlands daughter? I think Ive had the suspicion since the first book, because there is a short part where he talks about why he left Luna, and it just fit together: the dead daughter and orphan Cress. I wish he had told her sooner though! Just when she finds out she has a father, someone who loves her, he has to die! How unfair is that? I teared up at that part. I liked Dr. Erland. He did so much for Cinder. He told her who she was, got her cool cyborg parts, helped her escape, and fixed hopefully Thornes eyes. Now who are we supposed to turn to when something goes wrong? I felt like Cinder, as always, was carrying the team. Shes the only one without a lot of problems in this book, and everybody else seems like a liability. Seriously. Scarlets gone. Wolfs going crazy again. Thorne is blind. Cress has never been to earth. Dr. Erland is weak and dying. Need I go on? I felt really bad for Cinder, because she was the only one who had everything together. Still, the teams difficulties caused some pretty close calls and interesting scenes. I loved this book so much and its definitely my favorite out of the series. I cannot wait for Winter. Another year? No. I cant handle the wait and now Im really wishing I waited until the series was complete to start it. Oh, well. In the end, I do this to myself.
Better When Hes Brave, Jay Crownovers third book in her thrilling Point series, is mesmerizing with metaphors that make you want to catapult yourself right into this adrenaline rush of a steamy, suspenseful, and scary story, and experience this masterpiece firsthand. The Better When Hes Brave book experience is like watching a nailbiter of a thrillerromance movie, sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next chase, death, or jammedpacked action to happen all while enjoying the steamy love scenes in between the fast, furious, and fearful moments. Like the rest of Jays books, youll want to take your time reading and savor Better When Hes Brave like a fine wine, devouring each word as it were your last drink. With some authors, you may skip a line, paragraph, page, or morenot with Jays writing where you dont want to miss one bit as each descriptive and delicious word matters. Jay Crownover killed it with Better When Hes Bravea story that takes you on a memorable and magnetic merrygoaround of emotions where your heart and head are spinning around and around with feelings of anger, happiness, sadness, and frustration so much that you hope, like a Russian Roulette Wheel, it lands on or ends with happiness and that the heros are left standing at the end. You can feel the emotions in this book as Jay Crownover masterfully brings her hot bad boys with big hearts, like Titus, to life. Jay has a way of making you love the baddest of bad boys in her powerful Point novels, the ones who sway from criminal to hero, the boyfriends that mothers would hide from if you brought them home, the boys you should probably run from too...but you wont...as you cant help but adore these saints and sinners. Detective Titus King, Baxs older brother, is hot, tall, muscular, and a police officer who tries to make the dirty and corrupted Point a better place to live. Chasing his inner demons on a daily basis, Titus is a good guy in the Point but struggles with monsters trying to bubble up to the surface, sometimes walking a fine line between right and wrong. It was a place that was so bad, so dark, so lost in crime and violence it didnt have a name...we simply called it the Point. It was the ending point, the breaking point, the point of no return...it was simply a place where only the strong survived and anyone else was bound to die trying. The Point had no room for heroes, but I was as close as this place was ever going to get to having one. Beautiful ravenhaired and blueeyed Reeve Black has been wronged so many times and is painted as a bad girl when she tries to do the right thingthough sometimes leaving a path of destruction and destroyed lives behind. Like Titus, Reeve walks a fine line between right and wrong. I had a reputation and it wasnt a good one...I was the worst and I never pretended to be anything else...I had to do something not motivated by my own selfish desires and my own burning need for payback and revenge against the cruel injustices I knew this place was capable of doling out...Hiding was for the weak, and I knew deep down to the core of who I was that I would never, ever actually be safe...The Point was going to war and I was about to become the advantage that the good guys were going to need if they wanted any chance of being able to hold their own. For her own safety and of those people of the Point, Reeve needs to do the bravest thing in her life and engage Titus to help put a former lover, a wolf in sheeps clothing who has hurt too many people, in the ground or behind bars. Some men wanted to watch the world burn. Titus was a man that wanted to put out all the flames singlehandedly from inside the blaze. He was so beautiful...built like an impenetrable bastion...so tall and wide that it seemed like nothing would ever be able to break its way inside of him. He was everything a man should be. Titus doesnt want to work with the woman who almost got his brothers girlfriend killed and is nothing but trouble. He doesnt want to be around the gorgeous woman that scorches him to the core like no other. Reeve is bad for him in every way. Though he needs her to capture the most evil villain and killer the Point has ever seen, and pretend to be Reeves boyfriend and lover to lure the killer lion out of his cave. It will be a job...nothing more. I would prove the sit out of the face that I could do what I had to do in order to make this scheme of mine work. I could pretend to like her, which really was the only thing that would be fake...She was beautiful but she was also deadly...It was supposed to be an act of defiance, and maybe it was for a split second, but then it was nothing but a kiss and I forgot who she was and what it was supposed to be about...I dont ever think I ever felt so good and so bad at the exact same time. Titus makes Reeve feel warm inside and out, makes her feel protected, and loved. Shes a ticket to taking a villain down. He tasted like he looked, strong, sure, and potent. He tasted like righteousness and honor. Redemption and repentance. He tasted like goodness, and I didnt think there was any way I was going to get enough of it. Reeves a job to Titus, but they both cant deny the magnetic pull and scorchinghot chemistry. Their fake relationship is becoming real. This is happening, Titus. Fight it all you want but you can see it coming form miles and miles away. Fighting his feelings brewing for Reeve is tearing Titus up inside. Reeve brings his inner monsters up to the surface; he can be both his good and bad self around her. Titus sees the good in Reeve like no one else does, but also has a job to do. I wasnt angry that I wanted her, I was terrified that I did. In a city of more wrongs than right, where crime rules the streets and sucks even the best people into its ugly clutches, Reeve and Titus have to not only fight the villain together but fight for peoples lives and for them. With villains and past demons luring over them like a dark storm cloud waiting to destroy everything and everyone, will their relationship survive the perils of the Point? While Jay Crownover in her beloved Marked Men series makes you fall in love with the bad boy, in the Point series, she makes you fall in love with the criminal. Jay has upped her reading game out of the park and up the Rockiescreating the most brilliant bad boy books! This Point series, like the Marked Men, brings the Crownover Crackthe best kind of crack for the book whore. I cant wait for my next Point date as I know its going to be like the rest of books Jay crowns in gold: an adrenalinerush and a riveting roller coaster of a read that will leave you aching for more. 5 brave and brilliant stars
4.5 Beautiful writing, complex characters and epic love story STARS Yep, from that line above you already know how I feel about this book, huh? And if you read my review of The Wrath  The Dawn then you know how I feel about the series and its author. The Wrath  The Dawn was one of my favorite reads of 2015. It easily made my top 5 list. And its sequel will certainly be featured on my favorites list this year too. Though not as sexy and angsty as the first, The Rose  The Dagger is just as good as I expected it to be. What I didnt see coming was the heartbreak and how itd make me cry. Yep. I cried, people. That doesnt happen often, but can you really doubt Renees superb writing can evoke all kinds of emotion? If its been a while since you read the first book which was my case  why did I have to wait so long? How did I wait so long?, then let me refresh your memory. Last year, Renee Ahdie brought us the love story between Khalid, the monster boyking who took a new wife every day just to kill her the next dawn, and Shahrzad, the girl who offered herself as his new wife with a plan to get revenge for her best friends death at his hand. I know... I know... We soon learned Khalid wasnt the monster his people believed him to be. In fact, he was just a boy trying to protect his people from a curse, and because of that curse he had to let go of the one he loved the most. This is where The Rose  The Dagger starts. Khalid and Shahrzad are apart, missing it each other painfully, and making me feel so much only a few pages in: A trickle of blood slid down his arm. He felt nothing. He only saw it. Because nothing hurt like missing her. He suspected nothing ever would. Rip my heart out, why wont you? But the story doesnt dwell on those feelings for long fortunately or unfortunately, I cant tell, because Khalid and Shahrzad have a lot to worry about. Breaking a curse, finding a way to be together again, stopping a war, discovering and exploring hidden abilities and learning who to trust are all things on the agenda. Since this was a duology shock!!! How come you not giving me a third book, Renee? So mean, the author had all of that to cover and a satisfying ending to deliver. Needless to say, things had to move fast, and they did. Again, no matter how fast things moved, the characters stole the show. Even the minor characters like Shahrzads sister, Irsa and Tariqs best friend, Rahim. Honestly, it took me a while to get behind Irsas POV chapter. I often felt like it needed to be narratedfocus on other characters  mainly the one where Tariq was acting stupid with a bow and arrow, but when I finally understood the importance of her chapters and Irsa as a character it was too late... Too late to not feel. Too late to not be devastated for her. Not be devastated by that damn chapter. I am not crying again. Nope. So thank you, Irsa, for making me feel. Someone who also made me feel a whole lot was Irsa and Shahrzads dad. What an obnoxious man! I wanted to kill him many times, even though deep down I understood where his hunger for power came from. It doesnt mean I forgive him for everything he did and all the pain he caused, but yeah... write complex characters, why dont you, Renee? Talking about complex, Shahrzad embodied that word in this book. She was a great character in book 1, but her flaws and qualities were even more pronounced here. Shahrzad was selfish and incredibly stubborn at times. Rude in so many occasions. But she was also brave and bold and fearless. She was sexy and powerful. And then she was weak. I wanted to learn more about her power and thought she couldve done much more with it. Thats pretty much one of the only negative things I have to say about the way the author handled the story. Mostly, I loved how Shahrzad made me want to punch her, just to want to hug her a few moments later. By the end, I was exhausted and happy to have known her. Put them away at once, you miserable louts! Shahrzad insisted. This is why the world would be a far better place in the hands of women. What to say about the boys? I continue to love Khalid fiercely. I mean, how can you not? He was the one who changed the least from the end of the last book to the end of this one, which can be a good and a bad thing. I see it as a great thing, actually, because I loved him just as much. Tariq, on the other hand, irritated me way less here. He grew on me, I guess. He showed me his pain and I couldnt help but feel it and feel for him. A love that big had to hurt when not returned, especially since it had once been. Tough we got less chapters from his POV or maybe because of it?, I had the sense I knew Tariq a lot better now and understood and liked him a lot more. I also liked the surprises involving characters that played big roles in the first book, but practically disappeared in this one just to show up at the right time. Right before Despina Shahrzads handmaiden and friend showed up for the second time with her SURPRISE moment, I was just wondering what had happened to her and what had been the point of showing her earlier if shed only disappear for the rest of the story. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the power of writing. Renee masters it  we all know that by now  and she showed it again by bringing Despina back right when she was needed. claps Oh, let me just add something about another minor character  Yasmine. I wont get into details because of spoilers, but if the idea in the end was truly Yasmines, shes the smartest person in this story. She found a way to keep the legacy her father was about to throw out the window because he was stupid and still look good while doing it. I admire her. And I ship her with youll know who when you read it. I knew it was going to happen and I approve. I also approve of the ending. A lot. A whole damn lot. The almost heart attack was unnecessary, but the pages after that were just perfection. So much love for those characters and their future. So, in case you didnt notice, I loved The Rose  The Dagger and, most importantly, I loved that group of characters. I also loved Renees beautiful prose. Now go get your copy and read it so we can spread the love.  I need this just as bad as I needed the first and now LOOK AT THIS PRETTY COVER!
5 Rampion Crew Forever STARS Shes our lost princess. And shes coming home. When you finish a book with some tears, the so happy I read this, but sad its over kind of tears, you know it was a good book, a great series. What a ride!!! This book was so great, and I cant love it more even if I wanted to. I honestly didnt even realize it was a 800 pages book until later because I had the ebook version, but being completely honest, it flew by so fast I was at the end hoping there were more pages. She would be brave. She would be heroic. She would make her own destiny. Winter picks up after the events in Cress. Emperor Kai was kidnapped by Cinder and the rest of the crew, succesfully stopping the wedding. But thats not gonna fix all the problems, so now they have come up with a plan to get Queen Levana out of the throne. It involves changing the wedding plans to be set on Luna, sneak the revolutionay group on the Moon and hope they can convince the Lunars to fight together for Princess Selenes cause and their ultimate freedom. But things never go as planned, and the whole Rampion crew will have to face more than just one challenge in the way to rebellion against Levana. This is Winter, said Scarlet. Princess Winter. Thorne guffawed and pushed a hand into his hair. Are we running a boardinghouse for misplaced royalty around here, or what? This time around we also get Winters POV, which I was intrigued since last book because having a crazy characters pov always sounds interesting. She was such a pure character, always caring for everyone else and just being plainly good. I felt for her with all the hallucinations she went through given her choice of not using her Lunar glamour. I also enjoyed she was a playful character and her banters with Jacin and Scarlet had me shaking my head and smiling at myself. Its not proper for seventeenyearold princesses to be alone with young men who have questionable intentions. She laughed. And what about young men who shes been best friends with since she was barely old enough to walk? He shook his head. Those are the worst. The development of the characters was so good. Kai, which had felt so plain in the majority of the books, was finally able to show some layers and I enjoyed everytime he smirked at some rebellion act when Levana was present. Ikos more present figure was so entertaining, not only because she was humor on wheels but because it was so interesting seeing her so human, Im really looking forward reading more of her soon and with certain guard. Jacin didnt have much screen time to say it someway, but I still was able to see how he grow up from this keeping at arms length attitude, to one where he wanted something else from life and fight for it. Cress being badass was what I lived for, just like Scarlets alphaness. And obviously, my favorite, Thorne. This series wouldnt be the same without him 3 Thorne scoffed.Careful is my middle name. Right after Suave and Daring. Do you even know what youre saying half the time? asked Cinder. The relationships. Not only romantic, but also platonic were the best part. I loved that the series took a stronger characterdriven path, because thats what won me over since book 1. The sass was present in every single interactions of this characters, and I spent so much time laughing with all of it. You understand sarcasm? Of course I understand sarcasm, she spat. Its not like its theoretical physics, is it? Scarlet and Winter were certainly at first an odd friendship because Scarlet didnt think of it that way, but they ended up having this bond I loved. Kai and Thorne was another friendship I adored, with Iko and Cress. I enjoyed of Cinders connection to Iko, plus Wolf and Thorne and Scarlet as well because it was so pure and strong, like a family that had always been there for you. And just the fact that all 9 of them become in exactly that, a family. It ocurred to me that if I could find the cyborg that fit this foot, it must be a sign we were meant to be together. He twisted his lips to one side. But then I realized it would probably fit an eightyearold. Eleven, actually. I liked seeing Winter and Jacins relationship, not only because their friendship was such an important part of everything, but because they had this bond since little kids that no one was able to deny, especially wth how deeply they cared for the other. Cinder and Kai made my heart melt, and I was so into the chemistry they had together and also having them as a team to stop Levana. Wolf pulled back and cupped her face in his gigantic hands, still beaming. In the tavern in Rieux, when all those men were making jokes about Cinder at the ball. You called them swine and you got up on the bar and defended her even though she was Lunar, and that was the moment I started to fall in love with you. Wolf and Scarlet had such an amazing bond, the fierce protectiveness not only in the physical side but also in the emotional had me falling more in love with them, and I really would have loved more scenes of them together. And Cress and Thorne,ImIm sorry about your hand, she stammered. Dont, he said quickly, as if hed been expecting this apology. Scarlet and I are going to start a missingfingers club. We might let Cinder be an honorary member.  which are my favorite. It was a little frustrating seeing them dance around their undeniable feelings, and sweet how Thorne wanted something better for Cress than him, but we all know how for Cress there wasnt anyone but him. Captain? Cress. She couldnt not say it, although she realized he was right. It was sort of scary. Much scarier than it had been the first time shed told him, out in the desert. It was different now. It was real. Im in love with you. He chuckled. I should hope so, after all that. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss against her temple. And I love you too. I could talk days about everything I loved, but this review wont get any better because the truth is this book gave me so many feelings and I just never wanted it to end. This is the kind of fairy tales I want to read: the fastpaced, full of action and with strong, amazing and sassy characters you fell in love with. I know some people give up this series because Cinder is not a that great of a book, and I can just say that even if Cinder is not my favorite book from this series, it only gets better from there. So if you start reading, dont stop, you will want to read all of this books and live the experience all this amazing characters go through. Im pretty sure you wont regret it. And they all lived happily to the end of their days.
Reread on audio This is one of the best books I have ever read. Im going to say a lot of personal things on here then go on with the review which will include spoilers, but I will put up the spoiler alert before I do. I also want to add some quotes from the book and the authors note at the end. This book is about teen suicide and bullying. But, its also about some wonderful people, happy moments and a bit of crazywonderful. When I was young I was bullied in school most of my life. I ended up quitting school and getting a high school diploma through the mail, which is legit but doesnt seem so since I never finished school. I never told my family about this and to this day at 43 they still do not know. My entire family think I was just some kind of a loser that didnt want to go to school. Never judge a book by its cover right? When I got sick, physically in 2008 it put me in the hospital overnight and I came out with all kinds of mental disorders. Im guessing they were brewing on the surface as I have always had some anxiety. I came out with severe panic disorder, agoraphobia fear of going outside for me, ocd, depression and then came the physical stuff being fibromyalgia and arthritis from all the hard playing I used to do outside before all of this and hereditary with the arthritis, Im assuming. All of these things turned so bad that I wanted to kill myself many times. I still feel suicidal to this day, and yes I see an psych, no I dont take a million pills, only one for panic. The one thing that held me back was my dog Dakota, I never wanted to leave him, he was my son. Then he had to be euthanized suddenly in Feb. of 2013 from cancer. He just collapsed and then here I am having to kill him. And I thought this is it, I can finally leave and go with him. One out of the couple of friends I have, sent me flowers because she knew he was my son and how much it about killed me much less me killing myself. Surprising to me was that my dad was very understanding and always checking on me since I cried every day. My family knew I always said I wanted to leave this world when he goes, so I guess he was a little worried. And my stupid self let my family and doctor talk me into getting another dog. Now here I am with my rescued greyhound and I dont want to leave her, but I tell you I feel the pull of suicide a lot. I even tell her about it. Her name is Lucy. The reason Im telling all of these personal things is I want some people to know a few things from someone that really thinks about these things. It doesnt make any of us freaks and we cant just get over it. Thats what people say in this world with mental illness. If its not physical its not real, well I would like them to walk a day in any persons shoes with any kind of mental illness. If we could just get over it we would have freakin done that by now. Im going to add a quote from the book that sums up how I feel personally and I know alot of people feel the same way. QUOTE FROM BOOK Amanda stares at her hands. I can only tell you how I felt. Ugly. Disgusting. Stupid. Small. Worthless. Forgotten. It just feels like theres no choice. Like its the most logical thing to do because what else is there? You think, No one will even miss me. They wont know Im gone. The world will go on, and it wont matter that Im not here. Maybe its better if I was never here. Quote finished This gave me chills because I have said that in my head and out loud so many times. I even asked my parent why they even had me. And you see so many people seem like they are ok, they can hide these things. Look at Robin Williams, it doesnt matter if your rich or poor, if something is going on with you and there is nothing to be done or no one sees it... thats it. Being lonely sucks! Okay, lets move on to the review! SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT I fell in love with Finch from the very beginning. I liked Violet too, but its Finch that steals the story. He is fun, crazy, seems like he is so full of life, but hes not.. Finch and Violet meet at the top of the bell tower at school. This was not a planned meeting, this was a random meeting of two people that where thinking of committing suicide. Can you imagine, someone messes up your suicide attempt. These stupid, insignificant prats are yelling for Finch to jump. They should have the crap beat out of them. People like that make me sick. Anyway, Finch ends up talking Violet down from the tower but lets everyone think its the other way around and she is labeled as a hero. They end up being friends, but not without a lot of pushing on Finchs part. Violet doesnt really want to be around anyone too much. Her sister Eleanor was in a car wreck with her almost a year ago and Eleanor died and she didnt. Violet feels like this is her fault because she told her to take the iceslicked bridge. So Violet has her own issues. She wont get in a car, things like that. Sweet, wonderful Finch brings out all of the good in Violet. Brings her back to herself. They do a cool report for school together where they wander around and look at wonders in their town. Its so wonderful and I would love to do that! They do fall in love, and I was so hoping this would help Finch. But throughout the book he is still fighting these death feelings. He has a mom and two sisters, but they dont see anything wrong, they just say that is Finch. He has a dad who left them for another woman and her son and he is a big jerk of a dad always saying Finch is a loser etc. I think Theodore Finch is a wonderful character. Just like so many out there that take there lives or lose their lives. I can see how wonderful he is, but he just cant. Obviously, Finch takes his life, but Im not going to say how he does it. Im not going to say any more about this wonderful book but to tell everyone to read it! Read it! Understand it! Love it! These things are real! People like this are real! And there should be no room left in the world for bullies or people that dont understand mental illness. Get off your high horse and let others live the way they want and try to have some compassion! I cant find the other quote I highlighted but I think I got my point across! Im going to put the Authors Note in here because I think it is another important thing for people to read.

AUTHORS NOTE FROM THE BOOK Every forty seconds, someone in this world dies by suicide. Every forty seconds, someone is left behind to cope with the loss. In All The Bright Places, Finch worries a lot about labels. There is, unfortunately, a good deal of stigma surrounding suicide and mental illness. Often, mental and emotional illnesses go undiagnosed because the person suffering symptoms is too ashamed to speak up, or because their loved ones either fail to or choose not to recognize the signs. According to Mental Health America, an estimated 2.5 million Americans are known to have bipolar disorder, but the actual number is a good two to three times higher than that. As many as 80 percent of people with this illness go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. If you think something is wrong, speak up. You are not alone. It is not your fault. Help is out there.

this review can be found at Jenna Does Books. I hereby declare CROWN OF MIDNIGHT by Sarah J. Maas the most worthy sequel of all sequels that have ever been written. Alright, perhaps I dont exactly have the authority to make such a declaration, but the beautifullywritten, thrilling and mysterious sequel to the 2012 release, Throne of Glass, is more than deserving of the praise. I read both Throne of Glass and CROWN OF MIDNIGHT in an almost marathon, with only one book in between. I cannot believe I waited so long to start this series! Now that Ive read these first two books, I am already waiting with bated breath for the next installment. The wait each year, until the sixth and at the time of this writeup final book is released in 2017, will be pure torture, I tell you... Pure torture. With that said, I guess youd probably like to know why I love CROWN OF MIDNIGHT so much. I loved this second installment even more than I did the enthralling Throne of Glass, though that feat seemed near impossible at the time I was reading it. For anyone who enjoys good fiction  not just fantasy or magic or historicaltype novels, but plain old good fiction  CROWN OF MIDNIGHT is a mustread. In this single novel you have the perfect combination of an original premise, a wellthought out cast of characters that you can root for as well as despise, a clash of kingdomsenemies and allies, an unpredictable mystery, plenty of romance, action and adventure and so much more. If I had to make a comparison, after reading just the first two installments I can already see the Throne of Glass series doing for young adults and adults what Harry Potter did for kids and adults in the last two decades. What did I like most about CROWN OF MIDNIGHT? Id say the writing, since the book is full of so many quotable passages and is highly readable for any lover of fiction. The descriptions the author uses to develop her world, her mythology and a history of magic are far more convincing than anything else I have read in fantasy fiction lately. Her dialogue conveys the characters personalities and emotions, while allowing the readers to fill in the blanks and develop our own opinions about their motives. The fact that the author excels in her writing style and skills is undeniable, but that is not the only reason I loved this novel... I also loved how solid every single element of the story feels. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT takes the introductions to both the characters and the world from book one and progresses those items into a solid story that, albeit fantastical, we as readers can 100 believe in. Actions and reactions roll off on each other like the swell of waves on steady seas. As with any ocean, those waves must come crashing into the shore at some point. In CROWN OF MIDNIGHT that crash comes with such force, at a point when the reader is most invested in the story, that it feels like the waves are colliding against our own heart. Because the author has created such a solid story, cast and world, both the good and the terrible things that happen within these pages are felt and believed in with every fiber of the readers being. But thats not all... Im always pleased when we get to see a romance progress before the final installment. I also love it when enough time has passed that the romance progresses in a realistic way, rife with uncertainty, passion and discovery. The love triangle that appeared in book one is quickly resolved in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. But that is not to say that things are all unicorns and glitter for our pair of lovers... This book contains plenty of romantic swoons, I cant deny that. But we must keep in mind that were talking about a romance involving a hired assassin for a tyrannical king, so things can and will go wrong for anyone who hopes for happiness... Hoo boy, but I love LOVE that the romance in this book feels just as solid as every other element of the story, despite its ups and downs. Can I just talk about the characters for a moment? There are so many within these pages, both old and new. In Throne of Glass I came to like the four main characters, Celaena, Chaol, Dorian and Nehelemia, as I gradually got to know them. While reading CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, my love for and connection to the characters just exploded! Trust me when I say that Throne of Glass was a mere buildup to the direction in which each of their lives were taken in book two. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT trumps all. Hands down. We see so much more assassin badassery out of Celaena in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. In Throne of Glass, I just wasnt convinced. But now.... NOW I AM. This girl kicks some serious bad guy butt, guys. Celaena balances the fine line between good and evil with finesse, but all the while I love where her heart is in every move she makes. I never thought that I would back a killer as much as I do the young and extremely dangerous Celaena, but there you have it: I totally support every kill she makes and would totally take her on as my own personal Champion. I wish I could go on and on about my love for CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, but since it is full to the brim with surprises and new developments, to say more would be to spoil the story for you. If you have not yet read the first book, Throne of Glass, you really need to get on that ASAP. For those who are eagerly awaiting this installment, trust me, the wait is worth it. Be glad you have yet to experience the awesomeness that is CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. Im sad that I will never again have a first read of it, but then again... I guess there will be at least four more first reads in this series, wont there? Can. Not. Wait.
This review contains spoilers. If you love Oreos or waffles, boys kissing, and overall cuteness then please read this wonderful story, I promise that you wont be disappointed. This is the kind of book that I had to read in one sitting while eating the best snacks and listening to my current favorite song because it was just fun fun fun. Im still in a happy daze. Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda follows sixteenyearold and notsoopenly gay Simon Spier, who prefers to save his drama for the school musical. But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. I actually think people would be cool about it, Martin says. You should be who you are. I dont even know where to begin with that. Some straight kid who barely knows me, advising me on coming out. I kind of have to roll my eyes. Fun factI actually started this book a while back, but I absolutely hated Martin and I got so mad at his character that I had to put it down, and then I never picked it back up unfortunately so. Did youdid you take a screenshot or something? Well, he says, I wanted to talk to you about that. Sorryyou took a fucking screenshot? He purses his lips together and stares over my shoulder. Anyway, he says, I know youre friends with Abby Suso, so I wanted to ask Seriously? Or maybe we could go back to you telling me why you took a screenshot of my emails. He pauses. I mean, I guess Im wondering if you want to help me talk to Abby. Seriously, why did he think that was okay in any way? And Simon kept describing Martin as a goofy kid that everyone in their school loves, but Martin has some serious issues and needs to take a huge step back to reevaluate his life choices. I mean: And then she looks up at me with raised eyebrows and a perfectly round mouth, and I cant help but laugh. That was so bitchy of me. I cant believe I said that. It was super bitchy, I say. Youre like a stealth bitch. What did you call her? asks Martin. I swear to God, that kid pops up out of nowhere and burrows into every conversation. Its okay, Marty. Were just messing around, says Abby. Yeah, well, he called you a bitch. I really dont think thats okay. Says the guy blackmailing a kid to help him date someone. I seriously despised him. And after some time he, funnily enough, started reminding me of Gabe from The Officeremember when Gabe started obsessing over Erin? Thats how Martin sounded like when he talked about Abby. Im sorry, but I just cant get over how uncomfortable he made me. I feel like I need to go listen to some really relaxing music because Martins got me all riled up. And maybe I shouldnt admit this, but I was rooting for him to have a horrible ending. The way he handled Abbys rejection was just completely disgusting. To quote Simon, Martin is the biggest, most cavernous gaping asshole who ever lived. And Martins email at the end pissed me off even more. But on a much more positive note, Blue Bram and Simon were so cute and grammatical. I cant believe Bram Greenfeld dressed up. Bram from my lunch table. Hes this quiet black kid whos supposed to be really smart, but Ive never heard him speak unless hes forced to. He leans way back into the corner of the couch, shuffling the toe of one foot against the other, and I never noticed it before, but hes actually kind of adorable. Subtle foreshadowing. I love it. It was an absolute delight seeing Bram and Simon together at the start because SIMON HAD NO IDEA: No fucking thank you, Abby, Leah says, in this sickeningly pleasant tone. Except her eyes are like crackling fireballs of rage. She stands up abruptly, pushing her chair in without a word. As soon as she leaves, Garrett looks at Bram, and Bram bites his lip. Which Im pretty sure is straightdude code for Bram likes Leah. And I dont know why, but it pisses me the fuck off. Little do you know... Foreshadowing in books usually gives me too much anxiety, but because I spoiled the ending for myself I couldnt handle the not knowing the first time I started this book, I was just smiling throughout my whole reading experience. For one thing, both Garrett and Bram have been totally cool about the gay thing all day, which I guess I didnt expect from a bunch of athletes. Also, Bram is cute. Like, really, really cute. He stands a foot or so back from the fence, totally sweaty, with a white turtleneck under his soccer shirt. And hes not really talking, but he has very expressive brown eyes. And light brown skin and soft dark curls and cute, knobbly hands. They are too cute. Also, I loved Ms. Albright, shes moderately badass for a teacher. I cant remember the last time I enjoyed reading about a teacher in a book. But she was definitely a pleasant surprise. Then she walks over to me and squats down in front of my platform. You okay, Simon? I feel myself blush a little bit. Im fine. Okay, well, she says quietly. Just know that those assholes are getting suspended. Im not even kidding. I will make it my hill to die on. YES! Also also, I love emails in books so the interactions between Blue and Jacques were absolutely delightful their emails about middle school memories still make me laugh: Honestly, though? I think the real reason I had girlfriends was because I didnt one hundred percent believe I was gay. Or maybe I didnt think it was permanent. I know youre probably thinking: Okaaaaaaay. Jacques FROM: bluegreen118gmail.com TO: hourtohour.notetonotegmail.com DATE: Oct 19 at 8:01 AM SUBJECT: The obligatory . . . Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy. Eyebrows, butthole mouth, etc. Blue Seriously, the cast of characters in this book were all so wonderful. And there was this one part with Leah that cracks me up every single time And Leahs also into slash fanfiction, which got me curious enough to poke around the internet and find some last summer. I couldnt believe how much there was to choose from: Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy hooking up in thousands of ways in every broom closet at Hogwarts. I found the ones with decent grammar and stayed up reading all night. It was a weird couple of weeks. That was the summer I taught myself how to do laundry. There are some socks that shouldnt be washed by your mom. I seriously laughed out loud. And the email parts of this book kind of reminded me of A Cinderella Story and their interactions. And then someone slides in beside me. Can I sit here? he asks, and my eyes snap open. Its Cute Bram Greenfeld, of the soft eyes and soccer calves. I loosen the seat belt to let him in. And I smile at him. Its impossible not to. I like your shirt, he says. He seems nervous. Thanks, I say. Its Elliott Smith. Im kind of hardcore grinning right now. Im really glad that we got to see those two get together and that it didnt end right there. But I was expecting for the book to have 10 more pages, so when I turned the last page in chapter 35 and saw Acknowledgments written, I was so let down. And this particular situation has happened so many times, but it still gets me every single time. This story was just so good and Im truly happy that I gave it a second chance. Also, Im really pleased that Martin didnt get a happy ending. Note: Im an Amazon Affiliate.

As soon as this arrived on my doorstep, I couldnt wait. I HAD to read it. Between Shades of Gray is one of my favorite books, and I love stories set in World War II. Im not normally a fan of historical fiction, but when it comes to WWII stories, I need them. And I knew this would be a phenomenal book. Of that, I had no doubt. I just didnt realize how completely and thoroughly it would destroy me in the process. Told in the perspectives of four very different people, Salt to the Sea explores an event that has been almost completely forgotten. There is Joana, a runaway from Lithuania. She was able to repatriate into Germany and become a nurse because of her heritage, but she feels so much guilt over leaving her family. Its something that she carries with her, and its something that makes her even more determined to live. To survive. Shes a brave, intelligent woman who will do whatever she can to help people, no matter who they are or what theyve done. She has so much compassion for others, and so much willpower to keep going, to keep walking. She doesnt want to look back anymore, but she cant ignore the guilt that grounds her. There is Florian, a Prussian thief with secrets. Hes both coldhearted and warm, both kind and mean. Hes a complex individual who you cant be sure of throughout the story. His motives seem to be selfserving, and yet, he does unspeakably nice deeds for people. For the ragtag band of escapees he meets on the road. For the young girl he saved from a dangerous soldier. Hes carrying something that would see him killed, and hes only got one goal in mind: freedom from the hold Germany has on him. Freedom from a past he cant let go of. His singleminded purpose is something that turns him stoic and silent, while his begrudging willingness to help is something that brings more humanity into a character who seems to just be out for himself. There is Emilia, a teenager faced with a heavy burden. She was my favorite character, this young lady who moves forward day after day, no matter what she goes through. This girl who finds the strength to smile, to hide behind a lie so she can continue putting one foot in front of the other. This girl who puts everyone to shame, with her sheer determination and bravery in the face of hardship. I admired her character so much, and her story just absolutely broke me. Yet, her fierceness made me smile, because she was not giving up the fight, even when she desperately wanted to. I adored her so much. And there is Alfred, where all I can say about him is: fuck you. Im actually glad we had his POV because it showed a different side than the others. It showed the tragedy through the eyes of a Nazi, a soldier who believed in Hitler and shared his ideals. But I hated his character for obvious reasons. Over the course of the story, you will feel a thousand emotions. Anger, sadness, happiness, pain, joy, rage, disgust. It is a truly heartbreaking story, but one that is also so full of courage and hope. Of small acts of bravery and kindness that will leave your heart aching because of the humanity in the story. Of death, too. For in a land ravaged with war, not everyone will make it out alive. This book follows the lives of four people, who are so different from one another, who are all keeping secrets, but who have one common goal: survive. And through it all, they minus Alfred become a force, a team. They become almost like a family, one that will look out for each other, even in the face of disaster. It was something so beautiful to see, people from all manners of life finding care and happiness and love together. This isnt an easy book to read. What happens, how the characters survive... What they go through is chilling to read about. This book haunted me. These characters haunted me. There were so many moments that made me want to just sit and cry for days, because it hurt so fucking much. The war was not kind to anybody, heritage be damned. But through these three MAIN characters, we also see what humanity is capable of in such times. What willpower and a steady heart can accomplish. What bravery looks like in the face of certain death. What a simple act of kindness can do to change someones life. What its like to smile when you dont think you can anymore. What its like to hope when youre continuously beaten down and about to give up. I will never know what it was like to live during the war, to be hunted because of my heritage, to be killed because of who my parents were. I will never know what it is like to live in fear. And I thank God for that, because Im not so sure Id be as brave as these characters. But with books like these, and Between Shades of Gray, I can be safely transported back to a time that seems long forgotten even though it isnt to a lot of people. This book doesnt make light of what happened, or of what the war was like, and of what it took to survive. And its a story set a few weeks before a majorly catastrophic event that has faded from the history books. To be honest, I dont remember much about what I was taught in school, but Im almost 100 certain Id never learned about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff. It was eyeopening, and something that made me cautious going into this because HELLO ITS OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO HAVE A HAPPY ENDING! But I couldnt stop reading. And I spent a good five minutes after I finished this emotionallycharged tale sobbing my eyes out. Because I had so many feelings, and I needed to let them out. These characters burrowed themselves deep into my heart and wont let me go. Im still thinking about this book. Im still affected by it, more so than I had been after reading her other WWII novel. And I think thats exactly what the author had been going for. Because this isnt something thatll leave you that easily unless you are, like, dead inside, and its something thats not only important to read, but WORTH the inevitable disaster you know is coming. Salt to the Sea was a gorgeously written novel that follows four teenagers as they leave behind their pasts in the hopes of better futures. Rating: 5 Paw Prints!
Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales Quick  Dirty: Legends come to life with all the flaws of us mere mortals. Full of action, suspense, and naughty scenes including patio furniture and a homemade whip. Opening Sentence: Ares, also known as War, second of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to much of the human and demon world, sat astride his stallion on the outskirts of a nameless village in Africa, his body and mind vibrating with energy. The Review: Every religion has two things; a story about the Beginning of creation and the End. Human nature makes each of us curious about where we came from and where we are going. The Lords of Deliverance series gives us an interesting interpretation of the Apocalypse and the Horsemen in charge of heralding it. Larissa Ione presents us with four very human legendary figures, being halfdemon and halfangel, which walk the line between good and evil. But the first seal is broken, and the end is inevitable, isnt it? Ares, known as the Second Horseman of the ApocalypseWar, is a hard man. A great strategist and immortal warrior, he has had little to fear for the last fortyfive hundred years. The only thing he has to worry about is not having his Seal broken and unleashing his demon nature on humanity. But now that the countdown has started, the only thing keeping him from going evil is one little slip of a human female. Surely, if he can command legions of armies he can handle one lone female, right? Ares is stubborn, arrogant, and has way too much ego for one man. But under all of that, he was once just a man that had lost his family. And his long buried feelings and emotions resurface after spending some time with Cara Thornhart. But can he afford to have a weakness now, knowing that this war will mean the difference between good or evil triumphing? Can he set aside old grudges in order to create alliances that may make a difference between winning and losing? Cara has barely been surviving when circumstances thrust her into a supernatural world that teeters on the brink of war. Her gift of kindness to a dog has led her to being bonded with a hellhound and, eventually, the carrier of Ares agimortus; his trigger for breaking his Seal. But humans were never meant to carry such a thing, and it is killing her. Now it is a race against time to save her life, and therefore preventing Ares from going evil. Cara realizes, now that her life is coming to an end, she has yet to really live. Her desperation to fight for her life leads her to take chances that she wouldnt before, including falling in love. She doesnt have the luxury of time with Ares and does all she can in the time she has left. This includes helping Ares get past his feud with the hellhounds. Cara too must face her own past and its consequences before she can move on from it. By letting each other into their hearts, both learn that love makes a person stronger, not weaker. Of course, all of this would be much easier if Ares brother wasnt working against them to get the Apocalypse started. Pestilence, once known as Reseph, is the First Horseman of the Apocalypse and the first one to have his Seal broken. Now that his demon nature is released, his only goal in life is to see his siblings fall as well. He is made aware of Ares attachment to Cara and uses it against his brother. Though it is understood that there is no going back once a Seal is broken, Resephs brothers and sister refuse to give up hope. They search for a way to bring back the man they love while he is searching for a way to take them down. I especially enjoy the closeness that these siblings share. Their fate has left them little sympathy with others, leaving them to only rely on each other all of these years. To have lost the Reseph they knew and loved and had him replaced with one that has no love in him must tear the siblings apart. To know that the only way they may be able to prevent the Apocalypse is to kill him must be such a heavy burden in each of their hearts. There is a lot going on in this book, including some hot love scenes. It picks up from the end of another series by Larissa Ione, The Demonica series. Though you can definitely read this series alone, if you want to know any back information, especially about Underworld General, you will have to read the other series. Otherwise, this is a good paranormal romance with a pinch of End of Days. Notable Scene: His thumb stroked her cheek, and she hated herself for liking it. I prefer human females, butHe gnashed his teeth so hard she heard the crack. But, what? she pressed. Theyre too smart to put up with your crap? I make them combative. Well, gee, with your personality, I cant imagine why that would be. Something sad flickered in his expression, but then it was gone, replaced by the ruthless cruelty again. Its my curse. When Im around humans, they want to fight. She squirmed in his grip. You think? His smile was both sensual and wicked. This is normal righting. You seen to be immune to my effect. Really? Because you seriously piss me off. He did other things to her, too, things he shouldnt, but it seemed that when it came to him, her body and brain were divorced. The Lords of Deliverance Series: 1. Eternal Rider 2. Immortal Rider 3. Lethal Rider FTC Advisory: Grand Central Publishing provided me with a copy of Eternal Rider. No goody bags, sponsorships, material connections, or bribes were exchanged for my review. The only payment received came in the form of hugs and kisses from my little boys.
Review on  Expectations Ive been wanting to read this book for a long time, but also never wanted to start reading it. I know reading this will be an emotional rollercoaster and I needed to be prepared for that. I talked to another book blogger Katrina and we decided to read this together! Synopsis from Goodreads Despite the tumorshrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazels story is about to be completely rewritten. Review The first five chapters show us a great start of a very touching story. When I started reading this, I knew that I will be emotionally invested in the characters John Green describes so realistically. I immediately liked the main character Hazel a lot. She has a good sense of reality. She has a great sense of humor, which is always a plus for me. We get to see her connecting with Augustus Gus. From the moment they meet, they seem to have some kind of deeper connection. I love Gus, he really gets Hazel and he is the person she needs. He understands her fascination for the book she has read over and over and he tries to help Hazel the best way he knows how. I also liked the sidecharacters, especially Isaac. I really enjoyed reading about him and liked the moments with Isaac, Gus and Hazel a lot. The writing is so beautiful and rich. I really get the feeling that I read Hazels thoughts and get to see the way shes trying to live her life, despite of everything going on. An example of the exquisite writing: Hazels on the phone with Gus: And then the line was quiet but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone. Part of the book takes place in Amsterdam. It was fun to read about the city where I live, which made reading this more dynamic for me. I definitely was crying my eyes out near the end, but still loved reading this story. It was definitely the roller coaster ride I thought it was going to be and I felt all kind of emotions reading this. I would recommend reading this, but only if youre up for it and ready to tackle this emotional read. Its beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. 5 Questions Katrina and me both answered these five questions about the book. Check out her review and answers to these questions: review TFIOS by Katrina 1. What was your favorite part of the book? Thats a hard one, because there are a lot of great moments in this book. To name one, I loved the scene with the swing set. Gus doesnt pity her and thats exactly what she needs. He doesnt see her as a dying girl. When he looks at her, he sees a great, funny and smart girl who he cant be without. 2. Did you have a favorite character? If so, who? I would have to say I loved most of the characters. If I need to choose a favorite one, I think itl be Gus. He understands her fascinations for the book she has read over and over and he tries to help Hazel his way. I really like Gus personality. He seems to fit Hazelsperfectly. He knows the struggles because hes been through the same process. 3. Was there anything that you didnt enjoy or would change about TFIOS? Of course I wished the sad parts didnt happen, but at the same time, it because of those moments this book is such an amazing novel. Its very realistic and honest. At the end, I think changing things would take away some of the awesomeness of this novel. 4. How did you feel when the book was finished? I cried reading the end of the book. I couldnt write a review right away, which is what I normally do right after reading a book. I really needed a couple of days to process what happened. 5. If you could say anything to John Green right now, what would you say I would say that I loved reading this and the story really grabbed me and didnt let go for a while. Reading this really motivated me to read more of John Greens books and Im sure I will read more books by this author in the future! Rating I couldnt do anything else that rate this book my full 5 stars. I loved it and it gave me all kinds of feelings. I feel like theres so much I havent said about the book, but I think you got to experience those things yourself and I dont wanna spoil that for you. If you have some time and a quiet place to read and cry, go ahead an read it!
No one deserves you like I do. No one sees you like I do. No one understands you the way I do. No one makes your heart beat like I do. He presses his palm against my heart. And no one else deserves to be inside you if they cant get there through here first. Cue tears and inaudible screams of feelings O.M.G. O.M.G. O.M.G. O.M.G. O.M.G. Im sorry, but I somehow cant stop saying that expression after reading this book. I mean, wow...Just WOW! I cant believe that Colleen Hoover has managed to do it againeffortlessly. I dont think Ive ever hated a book of hers, and honestly, I dont think I ever can. Every CoHo book just brings me to that book high that I absolutely loved being in. Before this, I just finished a book that I equally loved, and I cant express how much its such a gift to be reading two of my favorite books back to back. I am beyond happyheck, I am beyond myself. I cant even think straight because I just love everything right now, all thanks to this book. AMAZEBALLS! But in the end, I think theres only one thing perfect to say about Confess: O.M.G. Its amazing how much distance one truth can create between two people. Me during most of the read: PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT THE SECRET IS!!! I NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH!!! I CANT TAKE IT WITH THE HINTS ANYMORE! Yes, I was a monster. CoHo just creates the perfect plot twists and surprises, but of course, she has to torture her readers on what it is, and I just lost it with this bookin a good way, of course. I just loved how CoHo managed to intrigue me every single time, and of course, this piece of her did not fail! Some secrets should never turn into confessions. I know that better than anyone. I dont think Ive ever been uniquely fascinated with confessions until now. Before starting this, there was a note by CoHo that all confessions in the book are all true and were submitted anonymously by her readers. There were quite a few times Ive been intrigued by a confession, while some made me ache in the chest, and some made me smile. With this, Im grateful that those who sent in their confessions had the courage to share them, whether bad or good. Im scared Ill never stop comparing my life without him to how my life was when I was with him. One element I superbly loved about this book is the art. Id like to consider myself as someone who greatly appreciates art, but I wouldnt go to the extent of calling myself an enthusiast. But after reading this book and seeing all the beautiful paintings that CoHo managed to incorporate in this, I was overwhelmed with beauty. I think the confessions add an element of realness to your paintings that cant be found in other art. I definitely dont regret buying the hard copy, and every penny spent on it was entirely worth it. Also, I just have to say that Confess is one of the most physically beautiful books with a very engaging cover that I have ever seen. Here is one of my favorite paintings: Im in love with every single painting in this book. A big thanks to Danny OConnor for bringing to life Owens artworks. One big KUDOS to you, good sir! My mother says there are people you meet and get to know, and then there are people you meet and already know. I feel like Owen is the latter. Our personalities seem to complement each other, like weve known one another our whole lives. Okay, now lets go to the two main characters with the same middle name: Auburn Mason Reed  Owen Mason Gentry...OKAY IM SORRY BUT I CANT CONTAIN MYSELF! I LOVE THEM BOTH LIKE I LOVE MY OTHER FAVORITE OTPsand that says a lot! Can I just cue my tears again??? I just seriously loved them together. I am a sucker for soulmates we meet again we are destiny fate brought us together type of crap AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED AUBURN AND OWEN BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST THAT. I try to tell myself again that this is nothing more than a coincidence. Her showing up at my doorstep tonight. Her connecting with my art. Her having the same middle name as I do. That could be fate, you know. I just loved their relationship, and how simple it has been for them to connect with one another. I lived for their witty banters and sweet exchanges, but I died slowly inside whenever they were brought apart. Lies, confessions, and the truth: this book has been a mixture of these. But these three were present because of one thing: sacrifice. Both Owen and Auburn has decided to push themselves to the limit and even act beyond to their accordance all for the people they value and love in life. In the end, it was all selflessness. Selflessness. It should be the basis of every relationship. If a person truly cares about you, theyll get more pleasure from the way they make you feel, rather than the way you make them feel. These two shook my shipper heart, and I wouldnt have it any other way. I dont want you to remember what it feels like when Im inside you. I want you to remember how it feels when I look at you. I want you to remember how your heart reacts every time I kiss you. I want you to remember my hands, and how they cant stop touching you. And I need you to remember that anyone can make love. But Im the only one who deserves to make love to you. He kisses me like Im his canvas. He grabs both of my hands and intertwines his fingers with mine. His forehead meets mine when his kiss comes to an end. And of course, a big appreciation to my new book boyfriend: Owen Mason Gentry who makes me OMG to no end! I loved this guy beyond the worlds of the universe. He makes my heart paint a picture of how much I admire him. Everything about him is downright swoonworthy, and its no surprise why Auburn loved him just as well. His talent, I think, was the one that won me over. Well, that and his selflessness. I want to paint you, he says, breaking the silence. His voice is full of all the confidence I lack. Apparently my heart is worried I forgot it existed, because its giving me a loud and fast reminder of its presence in my chest. I do my best to swallow without his noticing. You want to paint me? I ask in an embarrassingly weak voice. He nods slowly. Yes. I smile and try to play off the fact that his words just became the most erotic thing a guy has ever said to me. O.M.G., you make me OMG! His initials are very appropriate for the way hes making me feel right now. I want to whisper, OMG, over and over.  Right on, Auburn! My sentiments exactly! Tonight, everyones focus is on my art, but my focus is on her. Shes the most interesting piece in this entire room. Again, wow...JUST WOW! I loved Confess, and I dont know how CoHo did it again, but I think she is one brilliant author! Coho, you take me to the clouds with your books, and I absolutely am grateful for that! You deserve all the love and appreciation you get! Just, thank you for this. OMG! I ALSO LOVE ADAM SO MUCH! AND HIS CONNECTION WITH OWEN! I WAS LIKE OMG!! OKAY IM FANGIRLING AGAIN TO THE EXTREMES! BUT YEAH LOVED IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT! I love you so much. His voice is breathless and full of fear. Ill love you forever. Even when I cant. My tears fall harder at his words. And Ill love you forever. Even when I shouldnt. Im afraid if I listen to my heart once, Ill never figure out how to ignore it again. And listening to my heart, it says that I give this book 5 stars!!!
Ive been hearing great things about Kristen Ashleys books for a long time now but although Ive had several of her books on my wish list for ages I still hadnt got around to buying any of them. When I got the chance to request a review copy of Own the Wind I couldnt resist though and Im glad I now know what all the fuss is about! Own the Wind is the first book in Kristen Ashleys new Chaos series revolving around members of the Chaos Motorcycle Club, this is actually a spin off from her Dream Man series, well the last book in the series, Motorcycle Man, anyway. Motorcycle Man is the story of the Chaos MC leader Tack and the heroine of this story is his daughter Tabby. Ive already mentioned that this is my first KA book so I can confirm that you dont have to have read the other series to follow the events in this one but I will tell you that Im definitely planning on working my way through the Dream Man series and the rest of KAs back list! while I wait for the next Chaos book, Fire Inside, to release. Before I actually start my review I should probably point out that this isnt going to be the book for everyone, these kind of Motorcycle Club MC romances tend to be love or hate books. Youve probably already guessed that I love them this is only my second but Id also highly recommend Reapers Property by Joanna Wylde but I do have to be in a certain mind set before I start reading. Im speaking from a limited experience but MC romances tend to feature very alpha guys, ones who often have a very sexist attitude towards women  especially ones they consider an easy lay. These guys live outside normal rules but they still have a very strict code of honour, just not necessarily one that follows the letter of the law. They fight for what they want, protect what they see as theirs and like to party. The women who hang around the clubs tend to belong to one of two categories, you have the ones who are just there for fun, who will happily sleep around with the club members and who are just kept around by the guys for sex on tap and to tidy up after them. These women arent respected and the guys attitudes towards them usually sucks but theyre there of their own free will and you only get treated the way you let people treat you. The other women are a completely different kettle of fish, they are the ones that have won the heart of a MC member and are usually referred to as old ladies. The men respect them and any children they may have, they will lay down their lives to protect them and nobody would dream of touching another mans old lady. Ill say upfront that I wouldnt want to live this lifestyle but I still find it fascinating to read about these tough guys and the women who bring them to their knees. I can separate reality from fantasy and enjoy these stories for what they are but if the above makes you want to scream in frustration and I can understand why it might! then youre going to want to give this type of book a very wide berth. OK, so now Ive got that warning off my chest lets talk about Own the Wind specifically. Tabbys father, Tack, is the leader of Chaos MC so she has grown up surrounded by bikers and understands the lifestyle. She has always known that the members of Chaos have her back and she is close with a lot of them but she has still managed to make a life for herself away from the club, she studied hard to become a nurse and she likes being independent. Tabby had a crush on Shy when she was in her teens but when she was going through a rebellious phase Shy tried to warn her off the path she was heading towards and the way he did it both embarrassed her and broke her heart. Since then she has given him the cold shoulder but when tragedy strikes it is Shy who is there to help her put the pieces of her life back together. I loved the fact that they became friends first, after everything Tabby had been through she needed someone who was going to look out for her and I wouldnt have believed in them as a couple if Shy had made a move on her any sooner than he did. Shy is the kind of guy I would run a mile from in real life but as much as he can be an ass he could also be very sweet and caring towards Tabby. I did love the way he looked out for her and the fact that he was prepared to give up everything to be with her if thats what it took. I ended up devouring Own the Wind, its the kind of story that sucked me in and held me completely gripped until the last page. I did find the time jumps a little confusing at first but once I got used to the writing style it made a lot of sense and allowed us to get a real sense of the way things developed between Shy and Tabby over time. I loved meeting the various side characters and am really looking forward to reading Hop and Lainies story in Fire Inside but what Im really hoping more than anything is that were going to see more of Shys brother Lan. I think I fell for Lan just as much as Shy which is quite an achievement considering he doesnt get anywhere near as much page time and I would LOVE to see him get his own happy ending. Note to the author  just send him my way and Ill make sure he gets one LOL. So, Kristen Ashley has found herself a new fan in me and Im looking forward to working my way through her back list in the near future.
In my humble opinion, this book was 320 pages of info dump. The Martian style except somehow more... overwhelming. Please dont get me wrong, I am not new to this kind of format. Like World War Z and Illuminae Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff, the story of Sleeping Giants is told in the form of interviews conducted by a mysterious, nameless person who seems to have a lots and lots and lots of power as well as in the form of oral diary entries. I loved it when it was used in WWZ and Illuminae because despite it being quite straightforward and in the form of documentaries, these books were still able to touch me on an emotional and personal level. They showed many perspectives and angles about a particular, seeminglybutabsolutely dreadful situation, and they made me care  care about the characters, care about the outcome, care about how they would cope with their trials and tribulations. Sleeping Giants made me feel... indifferent, at best. Heres the thing: the premise is fantastic. I love the idea of aliens having visited the Earth thousands of years ago, back to that time we were still grunting and snorting to each other in order to communicate, and having left this gigantic monstrosity of a robot for us to find when we have progressed and evolved enough. In paper, that really sounds intriguing. Think of all the political drama that can come out of this! Think of all the philosophical, moral, ethical discussions! The drama! The panic and the riot and the coming together of mankind as they realize its potential as a defensive manuever against extraterrestrial forces! In an ideal world, I would have loved this to pieces and I would have paraded this all over my street saying, Science fiction fans, come get your mama! But alas, it is not an ideal world, and this book lacked the emotional pull needed for me to completely and deeply immerse myself in it. 1. Nameless interviewer. 80 of the book is comprised of interviews with a cast of characters. Theres Kara Resnik, a welltrained pilot. Theres Ryan Mitchell, her copilot; Rose Franklin, a motherly figure who leads the project of finding all the robotic parts, putting them together again, and finding out what it can do; Vincent Couture, an introvert linguist who hails from Quebec, among others. The anonymous interviewer is connected with all of them, yet we dont find anything at all about him. Hes their Daddy Long Legs, funding their research and making sure everything is going smoothly, taking care of problems  people or otherwise  as how you would expect an ultra rich guy would take car of them. But... what else? We see the story through his interviews, and we get to know more about the characters through his questions, and then thats it? He was definitely a pragmatist, and he was definitely very objective in his questions. What did this scenario make you feel even though I already know about it but well need to repeat it again just so our beautiful readers here are aware? What happened to you when this thingy happened even though I already know about it and were just wasting our time here reminscing about it? Nonverbatim, but you get the picture. 2. Telling than Showing And then theres the problem. Because of these questions, we are forced into reading a narrative that is 100 telling than showing. I was doing this, I was doing that, I felt this, I felt that, I didnt like this, etc. etc. It was absolutely dreadful to know that these people were experiencing these things and yet I couldnt feel them. I dont know, maybe because of the format it was hard to do so? Maybe because it was just so limited and theres no other way of showing them otherwise? But then, how did World War Z and Illuminae do it amazingly? Theres also the problem that things would happen in this book, but we would never, ever, EVER see them happening. Were only told that it happened postsituation, when the interviewer is asking them to tell us about their feeeewings. It was hard to just care when I was never with them when that happened, when I never felt the adrenaline or the tension that they experienced that would make me relate to what they were doing. 3. THE SCIENCE MADNESSSSSS Now, lets draw a line here: I love science. I love talking about aliens. I find space and the universe and everything that is in it fascinating. If I could, I would love to die floating in the vastness of empty space. But the science here made me cringe. There were just so much that it became overwhelming. The process of how to get the robot pieces? EXPLAINED IN DETAIL. The process of how they are trying to get the robot to work, all the theory and the steps? EXPLAINED IN DETAIL. The process of how they plan to do this and that, and then this and then that? EXPLAINED IN DETAIL THAT IT HAS BECOME PAINFUL. I get the need for science to be incorporated but it alienated the reader in me so much because so much of it were jargon. So many big words, and none of them resounded with me. Maybe Im just stupid? Maybe Im just not the target audience? But I DO love science, and I love it when it weaves together with the characters personal lives, so maybe its just the book being a hugeass infodump? In conclusion, Im actually very sad that I didnt like this book more. The ending was interesting, if not a little too positive for me to take seriously. But these three factors up there? They totally ruined my reading experience. The only reason I plowed on was because of obligation. I may still check out the next book though seeing as this is a series, in hopes that the narrative in that one will be a lot more personal and emotional than distant. However, if youre the type of person who is a science geek and just want to get your science mood on with or without the emotional touch, maybe this will appeal to you.

A powerful and evocative read. It has been a good 24 hours since I last read the book, and I still cant get it out of my head. Its pretty much plaguing my mind every chance it gets, pouncing its awful reality on my brain like a headache I could not easily get rid off. This book ended me. In the truest sense of the word. Colleen hoover bared her soul with this one. This is the Colleen Hoover I fell in love with. This is the Colleen hoover hitting it where it hurts the most. This is Colleen Hoover not just telling a story for entertainment but so much more. This is digging deeper. This is flaw and perfection. This book hits home. When you literally drop everything youre reading just to read this one book. That constant curiosity and want gnawing at you. That feeling when it is all you think about every goddamn hour waiting for a minute, just one fucking minute you could spend with it. Waiting for unadulterated time, and actually being thankful for traffic or for idle time because you can read a page or two. It is really hard to contain ones emotions when you just wanted to explode and tell every single soul you come across with how erratic your heart is beating, how theres this quesy feeling down the recesses of your being. The adrenaline rush., my heartbeat in 140minute. Gahhh that was what happened to me, I was so attached to it, I practically couldnt function well. There are so many things going on inside my head, Im not even sure where do I get the energy to write this review because I feel like I am so emotionally exhausted. Boy I had to compose myself, I had to pace my room and contemplate about what I just read. It was as powerful as it was raw. It was as heartbreaking as it was real. Hats off to people who have read this and not one bit messed up, because I for one cannot deal with all the rush of emotions Im having all at once. I have so many things to say and I am afraid I may not be able to say everything there is to say. So let me just compose myself a little more. Give me 10 seconds more. You still there? Okay good. You ready to talk about it? To be completely honest, Im not. First off, I heard few friends who didnt like it. Which I completely understand. There is no one book that is for everyone. I guess it is just a matter of how much of yourself can relate to the story. And to tell you, this book hits home. Like it really nailed it where the wound had been and let it bleed anew. Im not one to go into details how much I related to this book. But this book gives you that bigger perspective, that sense of maturity of having to make an intelligent choice. God I wish I could say so much without giving anything away. Since Im always the one to give spoiler free reviews, I will try my best to give the book justice by not delving too much about the details of the book. Lets talk about the characters. There is Lily, a character I was able to relate in more ways than one. I loved how Colleen Hoover made her character reach out to readers, they may not have experienced that same thing her character went through, but she portrayed every woman faced with a predicament but was able to make choices that are selfless and intelligent. Her character was the one that made the biggest impact, she was someone who may have made wrong decisions along the way just like most of us but had conviction to stand by what is right. She was resilient and courageous and I adored Colleen Hoover for sharing such an amazing character. Then there is Ryle Kincaid, a man who has everything but is deeper than what he let on. His character was not hard to love. in fact his character was the one youll immediately fall for, until something happens gahhh I cant tell. And then there is Atlas, that guy from the past, to me he was perfect, to me he was the guy I wished I met or have my own version of. It is pretty obvious that I am Team Atlas from the very beginning. And of course I cant fail to mention Alyssa and Marshall, god I love those two!! So funny! They seriously make the book a little lighter. Colleen Hoover made flawed characters, she made characters that are relatable. She made her characters into this real individuals with demons they have to deal with day in and day out, this was the magic of this book, how it was able to transcend from the pages of a book into the real world. How you can very well imagine that there is someone who is actually just like them in this world. The only issue I had maybe was how every character looked gorgeous and perfect, maybe we could change that? Now lets tackle the whole story. I never read the blurb, I went to this book as blind as one could get. I have literally no idea what it was about when I started reading it, and again I am reminded that there is beauty in that. Not knowing what it was about, not knowing what to expect, not knowing where the story will take you. And I am so glad I didnt read the blurb, I am so glad my judgment was not tainted by what others thought about it. It was as pure as it could get. The story was a powerful one. It tackles heavy topics, something we should be talking about more, something we should not be afraid to read about, something we should challenge ourselves to understand more, something we should not shy away from. This book sent a message, loud and clear. Breaking the pattern, before the pattern breaks you. I had goosebumps whilst reading this book. Not only because I was able to relate to some extent but also because this was a bold and brave move by Colleen Hoover. Not many can write what theyve been through, but Colleen Hoover made this book so significant and relevant you cannot miss the message she was trying to send across. It Ends With Us was different and mature. It was a sad book yet a satisfying one. It was as heartbreaking yet as surreal. It was real life magnified and detailed, it was real life painted in a different light. It was a book everyone should read, not just because it is loved by many but there is a very important message that you could learn from. This book is an emotional rollercoaster, something you thought you are ready for but as it progresses through its loops and big drops, you will realize why the hell did you even ride in the first place, but after all the scare and the heartstopping moments you will learn how rewarding it is. That is exactly what I felt when I finished reading this book. Plethora of unwanted emotions came rushing in, and I could not contain it, it felt like my heart was going to burst, I literally had a hard time breathing, it touched sensitive topics that I would rather forget but I took the plunge, I was all in, and couldnt be more glad that I did. So Im gonna stop here, drop everything and read this. You can thank me later. And oh please read until Authors Note. Hands down to Colleen Hoover! Thank you for being BOLD and BRAVE!
This review was originally posted on Ticket to Anywhere Places Traveled To: Shady Creek, Georgia  Atlanta, Georgia First Lines: Its a weirdly subtle conversation. I almost didnt notice I was being blackmailed. Writing a review for a book that I adored are sometimes the hardest reviews that I have to write. Its so easy to pick out the things you didnt like about a story but when you love it so much that you simply want to crawl into its pages and live there forever? Not as easy to find the words. At least, words strung together in such a way that makes sense to those not living inside of my head. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli is one of those books where I feel all the feels and I may have already read it more than once even though I just finished it the other day. Its such a Mary Poppins story that is nearly perfect in every way and I just hated for it to end. Like for reals. My new mission in my bookish life is to pester Becky Albertalli over and over until she writes a companion story so that I can get more from this world and these characters. My love of Simon knows no bounds. I loved his voice and his POV and just everything about him. Hes real and down to earth and hell make your heart swoon. I love his relationships with those around him, his best friends and his family and best of all there is no pointless drama in this book!!! Oh the pointless drama is such a pet peeve of mine and its so refreshing to find a book that doesnt have that. Yes, there is conflict and issues but they arent over the top and they cant easily be solved by two people talking to each other. Because Simon and Blue talk all the time. At least, they do via email and they are so open and honest with each other. Oh how I loved those email exchanges and my only regret is that there werent more of them. Another thing I loved about Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda was the inclusion of parents within the story. Through Simon we learn about the various family units of his friends but who I loved most were Simons parents. They were much like mine in that they had jobs and they were involved in my life. I loved how they made a big deal out of everything because so often those small moments can be overlooked. I liked how when Simon messed up he faced consequences and when he was in a play at school they treated it as if he had the lead roll and not just a supporting part. They made me smile with every appearance on the page and I was just so happy to see a happy family unit. Too often in YA reads the parents are either dead, absent, or there but so selfabsorbed that they might as well not be there at all. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda also made my heart ache. I understood Blues reluctance to break through the wall of anonymity that the email exchanges gave him and Simon. To leave that safety and bring things to the real world. Especially in a smallish sized town where there arent many openly gay people its hard. Especially since the reality of a person can be so different than their onliner persona. But with every email exchange I kept hoping that in that one, that moment, Blue would be all for a meeting with Simon. It was for this moment that I kept flipping hurriedly through the pages as I was desperate to know who Blue was and where this story would go. And let me tell you, the ending of Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda, oh my stars, that ending was perfect. So very perfect. This whole book was perfection. Seriously. Which is not something that I think Ive ever said about a book before. Ever. Oh I am sure that there are flaws within its pages but Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda just hit all the right notes with me. It made me feel and when I hit that final page I sighed a happy sigh and hugged the book for all of the loveliness within its pages. It truly saddens me that I can never read this one again for the first time but I do know that it will be reread often and I will fall more in love with its story and its characters each and every time. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda is a book that you need to have on your radar. Its a book that I think everyone should read. If you only read one book this year than this is the book that it should be. This is something else that I dont say that often but I just feel so strongly about this book that I want to use all the cliches and all the words and all the everything I can in order to get YOU yes YOU!! to read this book. If I could buy everyone a copy of Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda I would but I cant. Its unputdownable and your life will be just a little bit better for having read it. P.S.A.: When you do pick up Simon vs the Homo Sapiens be sure to have a package of Oreos handy because this book will make you crave them. Add Something Real by Heather Demetrios to Goodreads.

It was a rainy day in July 2002 when I was first introduced to Harry potter. My father had brought the book, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, from the local library. That was the day and its today in 2013 I am as hooked to Harry Potter, maybe more so than before, as I was in 2002 when I first read about him. The Harry Potter phenomenon started in 1997 when the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, was published in Britain. The same book was published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone in the United States. It was the debut novel by J.K. Rowling and brought great acclaim to her as an author. The story revolves around Harry who is an orphan and is being brought up by his Aunt and Uncle. He is mistreated by his relations, who make him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs. Strange unexplained things have always happened to Harry like strange people bowing and winking at him as if they know him or howsoever times he got his hair cut they instantly became long and unruly like before or one time his aunt tried to forcefully make him wear Dudleys old sweater and it got so small that it didnt fit him which was impossible because Dudley was so fat. The dilemma with Harry is that others know more about him than he does himself. He has no recollection of his parents death and is forbidden to ask questions about anything. He is only told that they died in a car crash. He has a queer lightning shaped scar on his forehead and feels that that is the only notable thing about him for he is skinny, wears Dudleys old baggy clothes, has his spectacles kept together with cello tape and never seems to be able to get his unruly, black hair in order. But soon life takes a turn and he comes to know that he is no ordinary boy but a wizard!! Yeah you heard me right. Harry Potter is a wizard whose parents died not in a car crash but trying to save him from Voldemort or YouKnowWho or OneWhomustnotbenamed, who inspires such fear in people that no one dares to call him by name. Now its ten years since Voldermort killed Harrys parents, tried killing Harry and disappeared mysteriously some say that he lost his powers but is still in hiding; waiting to come back but his terror still lingers in the minds of the wizard community which fears his return. Harry soon finds himself whisked to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he makes friends, fights trolls, plays quidditch, has classes on potion making, defense against the dark arts and other magical subjects and also comes to know more about his parents and the man who killed them, Voldemort. Voldemort is again seen trying to come to power through the Philosophers Stone and soon its up to Harry and his friends to prevent him from finding it. The plot is very novel and stands out with its fresh story line, very innovative settings and heart felt characters which made it difficult for me to believe that its J.K. Rowlings debut novel. Though the theme of the book is magic and fantasy yet I never felt like I was reading anything far fetched. Such is the skill with which Rowling threads together the events that they feel authentic and I felt connected. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry is a creation of genius and is depicted as a mysterious place which thrilled me with lively descriptions of ceilings that looked like stars filled sky, of ghosts floating in air, castle like settings with long passageways, direction changing stairways, moving pictures, candles floating in the air, long tables with selfappearing food, big grounds for playing quidditch etc. Rowling gives a memorable introduction to Harry with the title The Boy Who Lived. The setting of the scenes and the description of the characters is so lively that it created a picture in my mind and all through the book I felt like everything was happening to me firsthand. She is able to make the reader feel each and every emotion experienced by the characters in the book like surprise and happiness which Harry felt when he came to know that he was a wizard or longing, sadness and half joy when Harry could see his parents standing behind him in the Mirror of Erised. The introduction of the Durselys is also very funny. Mr and Mrs Dursely, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didnt hold with such nonsense. I felt I had met such people while I read the description. Rowling also sketches her characters in a comical light with introducing statements like a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache, thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck ,pig in a wig for Mr Dursely, Mrs Dursely and Dudley Dursely. The same method is also adopted for the other characters which not only made them hilarious I ended laughing like a goon but I felt made them feel more real and effective. Its a 5 on 5 book with vivid characters that we all connect to and love like the wild looking but very caring Hagrid; gentle and a genius yet with a bit of humorous eccentricity Dumbledore; stern but kind, mother like McGonagall; bossy Hermoine; a best friend Ron; an enigma Snape; forgetful Neville; mischief makers George  Fred Weasely. The book is teeming with characters from teachers to students to house ghosts and its very easy to love or at least love to hate them. The book hooked me like it had done the first time I had read it years back. I have lost count of the number of times I have read this book but I still feel a thrill every time I pick it up to read such is the magic of Harry Potter. Kudos to J.K. Rowling for writing such an inventive and imaginative novel and I am just dying to review the next book in the series. This review is also available on my blog  Do visit my blog for more reviews. :
What kind of woman am I if I knowingly married a man that didnt love me? I feel giddy, euphoric, in awe, confused, converted, guilty for not having had enough sense to trust Tarryn Fishers wicked ways implicitly and absolutely. I also need to make a confession that I am not very proud of  I did not want to read this book. I was equally scared and sceptical of its content, and part of me believed that nothing could ever follow The Opportunist with equal merit. I hated Leah at the end of the first book  she was the perfect villain, completely unredeemable and so easy to demonise. Just the idea of reading an entire book in her voice made me want to scream and claw my eyes out. And then it happened, it had to happen  I read it. And now I am a brick away from completing a shrine to Tarryn Fisher. Reading a book in Leahs voice was necessary. I now truly believe that this story would have been incomplete otherwise. We are dealing with three flawed individuals who, some more than others, walk a very fine line between hero and villain every moment of their life. Although Olivia is technically meant to be the overall heroine in this story, we learned pretty early on that this is not a fairy tale  Olivia is not a virtuous princess who has been wronged by the wicked witch in the story and is only waiting for her prince to find his way back to her. Olivia is a quasivillain herself. She lies, cheats, tricks and manipulates, all for her own benefit, and her fate is her own doing. Just because we somehow bonded with her by the end of the first book in no way implies that she is easy to love as a character. Her imperfections make her more human than most and at times she is easy to identify with, but her actions too often make it impossible to feel any empathy for her. The ending of Olivias book was soulcrushing. It tormented me for months and I am yet to determine whether my torment stemmed from the status of Olivia and Calebs relationship or the fact that I was actually cheering for a character like Olivia. The more layers of this story we peel off, and the more we get lost in the lies that these characters have entangled themselves in, the more we realise that it all comes down to one simple scenario  a girl met a boy, they fell for one another madly, epically, irrevocably, but they did not know how to love each other. They hurt one another too many times while trying to fix what they kept breaking and eventually the lies were all that was left of them. But even in the aftermath of their gruelling romance, we are left with one deep conviction  Olivia belongs to Caleb and Caleb belongs to Olivia. And their attempt to live apart happily is their biggest lie. They spark. When theyre together, its like putting a hurricane and a tornado in the same room  you can feel the tension. I didnt believe in the cliche of soul mates until I saw them together. It is in that mindset that we start Leahs story. By constantly flashing back and forth from the time Leah met Caleb to their present wedded state postOlivia, we slowly get to know the Dirty Red... intimately. Her thoughts initially shock us, feed our raging hate of her, but the more we get to understand this woman, the less we are inclined to have such strong emotions towards her. Leah is the product of a loveless upbringing, a casualty of bad parenting, a lack of positive role models, and of never having been taught how to be a decent human being. She reacts before she thinks, she stings before others can sting her, she claims what she believes should be hers. Apart from her sister, she has never had anyone to cheer her on in life, feel proud of her, show her unconditional love and support, but instead of breaking her, this has made her determined to achieve her happiness by any means necessary. She unapologetically pursues a man she knows is still in love with another woman because in her mind no prize is greater than the woman she has convinced herself of being. I wondered what stupid btch let him go. Whoever she was, I would wipe her from his memory in no time at all. Why because I was the best of the best: the Godiva, the Maserati, the perfect colorless diamond. I could improve anyones life  especially this mans. We watch her change her colours like a chameleon, moulding herself into the woman she believes a man like Caleb would want, but it is like watching a car crash happening before our eyes  it is gruesome, it is painful and yet we cannot look away. Her lack of selfawareness and inability to find fault in herself and in her actions only feed her obsession with the other woman, as she blames her for all the shortcomings in her marriage, whether she is present in their life or not. No! I think. I am not the poisonous snake. Olivia is. Everything that Ive had to do is her fault. I am innocent. The few fleeting glimpses of goodness that we see in her show us that there is a broken little girl behind her selfserving facade, a trait that could have perhaps even dominated her personality had it been nurtured from an early age. We see the woman she could have been in her struggle to accept motherhood and in her inability to embrace her new role as a mother, a role she simply does not understand. I am not a good mother. Im probably worse than my own selfabsorbed, gin and tonic drinking mother. Leah is a woman that never quite grew up. She is still the same little girl who desperately wanted her parents to love her and feel proud of her. Her mind is a complex but inherently sad place, filled with a misplaced sense of entitlement, envy, deceit and a deeply concealed lack of selfesteem. As a reader, you want to hate her, her actions make it so very easy to hate her, and yet you struggle to hate her. By the end of this book, I felt like the impossible had been achieved  I did not hate Leah. She knew all along that her husband loved another woman, that he most probably would never love her that way and she still chose to live that reality. It made me very sad for her, at times even protective of her, and hopeful that she would somehow find her way in the future because a person like Leah is not born that way  she is made. This was a book I wanted to dislike and ended up LOVING. It made me feel so much, too much, and it proved to me two things  if done properly, a book can make us like even the most hateful of characters, and that Tarryn Fisher should never ever be allowed to become a politician. My name is Leah and I will do anything to keep my husband. See this review on my blog!  Follow me on Facebook!  Follow me on Twitter!
Since Logan turned shade it was almost as if time stopped for Aura. Her life was on pause as she waited for him to come back to her. Calling out for him, hoping that somehow he could hear her call. That once again she would be enough to bring him back. Logan had been her entire life, her past and her future. And even though she might have been ready to let him go, to let him move on so that she could finally learn how to live her life without him, she never wanted his existence to be in the dark, as a shade. But when he finally answers her plea, his return brings with it a complication that she never would have thought possible. One that puts Aura in danger, raising questions that cannot safely be asked, and one that can change everything. And this time Logans return will force Aura to choose between the boy she has always loved and one that could become her future.  Shift is the electrifying, gripping and absolutely heartrending second book in the Shade series. The mystery, the action and the love story will keep readers hanging on to the authors every word and unable to break away until the storys conclusion. Shift picks up where Shade left off. It is a few months later and Aura is still reeling from just how wrong things went for Logan. She has put her life, and Zachary, on hold, until she can find Logan and figure out how she can save him. But when he does return, she realizes that she will need Zacharys help to figure out just what Logans return means and to finally get answers to the questions about what significance, if any, her and Zacharys births had on the Shift. With time running out, Aura must decide who to give her heart to or risk losing both. Jeri SmithReady has done an exceptional job of building on the story and characters she introduced in Shade, and further developing and bringing to the forefront a couple that had been previously in the background. The author takes readers further along on Auras journey as she attempts to unlock the secrets of her and Zacharys existence while trying to break away from a past that doesnt want to let go. Shift is a story that will keep readers so immersed in the plot that only as the tears begin to fall will they get pulled away from this beautiful tale. The ending offers a number of possibilities for the next book and will give readers some closure, but they will definitely be left wanting more. The third book in the series, Shine, is slated for release in 2012. On a personal note: Let me just start by saying that I am a diehard fan of this series and the author, so be warned that there may be a little gushing below. As much as I wanted to read this sequel, I didnt really think it was possible for it to top the first book. I loved Shade, fell completely in love with Logan, and was a total sobbing, heartbroken mess after I read it. But oh I love this one so much more. I didnt think the author could possibly make me cry for Logan again and again. I thought my heart broke just that one time, but she managed to break it again. I am one of those sappy romantics that like to believe in love eternal, and that even death will not break that bond. So, of course, Im a total Logan fan and think that Zachary has always been in the way. And yes, I do cheer every single time something gets between him and Aura. I know its completely not realistic for Aura to be pining over a dead guy, but there is magic involved in this story and I will just keep the hope alive that things will work out with Logan for as long as I possibly can. Aura is much more practical than I think I could ever be in that same situation. But I am rooting for her to find happiness, even if it isnt in the end with Logan. Did I actually say that? Whatever direction the author takes with the characters I know will be the right one, even if its not my perfect ending. But until the final page of the final book, I will keep that torch burning for Logan. I read this book in one sitting. I think its taken me longer to write the review than to read the book, actually. And I cannot even begin to do justice to how awesome and amazing and utterly devastating this story and series is. I cant believe there is another year until Shine is released. I dont want to have to wait that long to see these characters again in my mind. So I will be rereading this series. I always love it when I discover a new author and series. I am so happy that I picked up Shade a year ago, even if I didnt think it was a subgenre I would like. The story wasnt anything like I thought it would be. It was so, so, SO much better. And any time a story can make me sob like both these books have, they are my perfect reads. Favorite passage: I looked at his face as his gaze flicked back to meet mine. He held it, held it, held it, while my entire body turned to flame. A note from my inner Geek: I love that this author added this tiny little detail that I think is cool, but may probably shoot me to the top of some Geek list somewhere. Zachary was the last person born before the Shift. His name starts with the letter Z. Aura was the first one born after the Shift. Her name starts with A. I know. I could have kept that one to myself.
3 stars? 3.5? Dont really know but you get the point. Let me just say that I started this while knowing every single spoiler, since its impossible for me to just wait while theres a new Harry Potter story out in the world. I was one of the creators of that one group chat of like 40 people that included two girls who were watching the play on its first day, and who were telling us pretty much everything. And we were all disappointed. My first thought was, is this a fanfic? Then someone found a fanfic on AO3 with the description ... using a Time Turner to go back in time and save Cedric in the Triwizard Tournament and I realized that yes, this story is as good as a weird fanfic. But of course I still preordered the book as soon as I could because, you know, its Harry Potter, and kept my expectations quite low. Cursed Child is not canon. I simply cant accept it as canon. This books storyline wasnt really bookmaterial, and I assume that watching the actual play must be a much better experience than reading its script. Its really weird, because it didnt feel like 330 pages at all, and Im not saying this just because its a script. I feel like this storyline, this plot, wasnt enough by itself; it was just Albus and Scorpius going back in time, messing everything up, and then fixing it. Really. Damn. Fast. Acts 3 and 4, specifically, felt so rushed. Yes, there were feelings, and yes, there was action like three times, but it didnt really make you anxious to see whats next. This could just be because I already knew what was going to happen next, but I do feel like this story could have been improved in some ways. 1. Everyone has addressed this but here I am. JKR is back at it with the queerbaiting. She hints at Scorpius x Albus. She builds it up all beautifully, and then, at the very end: I cant quite believe I did that. I cant quite believe you did that, either. Rose GrangerWeasley. I asked out Rose GrangerWeasley. Im not surprised and I wasnt expecting anything different, but, you know. Both JKR and Jack Thorne could have listened to the fans, for once. 2. They could have used the whole Time Turner thing to do something that would make everyone happy. Im not saying Marauders, but. Marauders. Im definitely saying Marauders. They were already at Godrics Hollow in 1981, if they had gone like three days forward they could have stopped Sirius from going to Azkaban. That would obviously alter the reality of the main series, but no one can see CC as canon anyway so why not try and make us happy!! 3. SIDE CHARACTERS! One of the things I was most looking forward to when I first heard about an eighth Harry Potter story, was finding out more about the interesting nextgen characters. We got a lot of Scorpius and Albus which Im happy about, and its inevitable since Albus is the main character, but where is Teddy Lupin? Wheres James Sirius? I was really disappointed because Teddy wasnt even mentioned, James Sirius only had like two lines, and they could have had such potential to be fun and interesting characters if they hadnt been completely ignored. 4. Im not even gonna talk about the Snape thing. Scorpius called Snape his light in the darkness. Sirius Black didnt die for this. 5. Better plot twists. Voldemort and Bellatrix have a daughter? Shes the answer this world has been looking for? This is some Ebony Darkness fanfic material, seriously. It sounds like I really dislike it, so why give it 3 stars? Well. 1. Albus and Scorpius. I really loved their friendship, really loved their characters, and Id protect Scorpius with my life. 2. The scenes at Godrics Hollow. Whoever knows me probably knows that you cant mention the Marauders around me without me crying, and so I loved the tiny bit of James and Lily that we got to see. Even if they were dying. Lily, take Harry and go! Its him! Go! Run! Ill hold him off... You keep away, you understand  you keep away. 3. Okay I know this is not a proper reason but I cant not mention it Sirius Black and his cronies. I had to take a moment there. 4. I felt emotions. Rarely, but I did. Hagrid leaving flowers at James and Lilys house, for example. Albus telling Harry Your dad used to love to do this smoke ring thing with you where you... well, you couldnt stop giggling. Dumbledore using Siriuss quote a bit altered: Those that we love never truly leave us. Okay, Im done. Was it too salty? Maybe, but when the very best series in the world gets a new part added to it, youd at least expect the story to be good. Cursed Child had to carry the heavy weight of seven incredible books, and it was obviously hard to live up to it, but as we know, this world will never be over; three months from now well have a new movie, and its hard to believe JKR will stop there. So theres hope. Maybe.
I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review and all opinions within this review are my own. I was really excited when Robert Eggleton, the author of Rarity from the Hollow, emailed me asking for a review of Rarity from the Hollow. For one thing I love books that are centered in my home state and another thing is I love helping out fellow Mountaineers. I became even more excited when I continued reading the email and found out that Mr. Eggleton donates his author proceeds to a child abuse prevention program operated by Childrens Home Society of West Virginia in his home state. Further into the review I will place a link to the CHSofWV webpage so you can see for yourself the things the program is doing to help the youth of WV. Lacy Dawn is an extremely smart eleven year old girl who is living an extremely hard life. She has to deal with poverty, abusive and neglectful parents. Her father, who is a Gulf War vet and is suffering from PTSD, constantly beats Lacy Dawn and her mother Jenny. Jenny is undereducated, there in physical form but is mentally absent when it comes to parenting and has lost her teeth as a result of having Lacy Dawn and poverty. Lacy Dawn has been told by DotCom Bucky, an android, that it is up to her to save the entire universe. With help from her friends and family will Lacy Dawn be able to find a way to save the universe? Lacy Dawn is our heroin and at the beginning of the story only a mere eleven years old. She is wise beyond her years, because she has had education lessons from DotCom for years, and she uses that knowledge to help friends and family in her own way. For a kid, I think she handled the news of saving the universe very well, but I think in most situations kids do handle things better than we expect them to. I really liked Lacy Dawns character. Jenny, Lacy Dawn mother, has been beaten down everyday since her husband and Lacy Dawns father returned from the Gulf War. She never finished high school so she is studying to take her GED test but she has to hide to study and she has to keep her study book hidden so Dwayne never finds it. Jenny also longs to get her drivers license one day. At times in the beginning I felt like Jenny was more content living in her past than trying to change her current situation. Dwayne, Lacy Dawns father, is suffering severely from PTSD and the VA has been unable to help him overcome it. Along with drinking and smoking weed on a daily basis he also beats the crap out of Lacy Dawn and Jenny using a switch. A good bit of this book I hated Dwaynes character and wanted nothing more than to knock the crap out of him. DotCom, aka Bucky, plays a huge part throughout the entire story. He starts off as an android sent to Earth over 2000 years ago to enlist Lacy Dawns help to save the universe. He is completely oblivious to the fact that Lacy Dawn has declared him to be her boyfriend and it almost seems like he really doesnt know what that means. About halfway through the book he hits puberty and finally starts to notice Lacy Dawn. I got really aggravated with the fact that he was constantly telling her that it was her job to save the universe but expected an eleven year old girl to figure out how. Tom is their neighbor who grows and supplies the entire hollow with weed and seems to have his hands into everything from pizza joints to portable potties. He seems like a nice enough guy but a little bit of a prev. I absolutely loved Lacy Dawns dog Brownie because of the brief glimpses into his thoughts in about the middle of the book. It was so funny and with that alone he became a favorite. I mean who wouldnt want to know what it is that their dog is thinking. Faith is Lacy Dawns best friend, and a little bit into the story she is killed by her father. She then becomes a ghost that stays in the magical type forest that is near Lacy Dawns house and inhabits different inanimate objects so she can talk to Lacy Dawn. Being Lacy Dawns best friend she tries to give her advice when she needs it but sometimes she is a little annoying because its very immature. Okay so now lets talk about the magical type of forest for a minuet. Lacy Dawn has the ability to talk to the trees and hold conversations with them. Apparently the trees will only talk to the kids who really need someone to talk to and with everything that Lacy Dawn has to endure thats just what she needs. Rarity from the Hollow is purely a work of fiction but there is a deeper message embedded within the pages. Robert Eggleton touches on the sick but all to true issues of child abuse, child molestation, domestic violence, alcoholism, drug use and poverty that are plaguing not only the beautiful state of West Virginia but every corner of the world. If you take away the scifi and fantasy aspect of this story this very well could be some childs life. I really enjoyed Rarity from the Hollow. Robert Eggleton has woven a story packed full of adventure, desperation, pain, heartache, romance, and humor. While this may be a book that might not be everyones cup of tea I definitely think that everyone should give this book a try. Although, I do feel that this is a book not recommended for children because of the issues and certain events that are described within the book.

Poppy  Rune, best friends for infinity A blossoming, beautiful, friendship that turns into so so much more This jar is for you to record your boykisses, Poppy. All the kisses that make your heart almost burst, the ones that are the most special, the ones you want to remember when yourre old and gray. The ones that will make you smile when you remember them in your mind. They shared their first ever kiss at the age of 8 Count down to One Thousand RUIN Kisses  And my heart almost burst Write down where you were when you were kissed. Youll have a treasure jar of all the precious kisses that made your heart soar. AGE FIFTEEN These two are closer than ever, best friends, kindred spirits, they are never apart, a love so strong even they find it hard to understand. But it is what it is.. Runes father has been offered a transfer back to Oslo, it could be weeks, months, years they dont know. Id seen Poppy every day since I was five. Slept beside her almost every night since I was twelve. Kissed her every day since I was eight, and loved her with everything I had so many days Id stopped keeping track. I had no idea how to live a day without her next to me. How to breathe without her by my side. A hasty tear felt, emotional roller coaster of a goodbye Kiss number three hundred and fiftyfour. With my Rune, in the blossom grove ... and my heart almost burst. My kisses are all yours, Rune. No one else will ever have these lips but you. Promises to keep in touch, talk daily, write to each other. Kiss number three hundred and fifty six. With Rune on my drive way when he left. Two long grueling years go by Poppy seized all contact, no emails, no phone calls, no texts, she left school, left town, she had vanished, no words, no trace, just gone. AGED SEVENTEEN Then words that Poppy never thought she would hear again Hes coming back. Moving back to where it all started, living next door, his bedroom right opposite hers across the yard. Do realize how deeply I feel about you? I slowly shook my head, needing her to tell me. She placed my hand over her heart and her hand over mine. I felt its steady beat under my palm, the steady beat that got faster as my eyes locked on hers. Its like music, she explained. When I look at you, when you touch me, when I see your face ... when we kiss, my heart plays a song. It sings that it needs you like I need air. It sings to me that I adore you. It sings that Ive found its perfect missing part. It seemed like every page I read had highlighted pieces on them that I wanted to share but then my review would be ridden with more quotes than the actual feels that raced through my body, heart and soul, this book surpassed all my expectations and has become one of my all time favorites from this amazing talented author.. Gods the feels, the train wreck of emotions, my head is thumping, my heart is breaking, my nose is running and my eyes are red and blood shot, I was warned that this book was a tear jerker but I wasnt prepared for how much. This book shattered me, it slayed me, it pulled emotions out that I never knew I had, could feel, this book is just truly beautifully written, this deserves to be read, this book deserves my tears, I will always have a spot in my heart for this book, I loved the depth of love Poppy  Ruin shared, a truly captivating journey.. Kiss eight hundred and nineteen was the kiss that changed it all. The kiss that proved that a longhaired brooding boy from Norway and a quirky girl from the Deep South could find a love to rival the greats. It showed that love was simply the tenacity to make sure that the other half of your heart knew he, or she, was adored in every way. In every minute of every day. That love was tenderness in its purest form. Im going to leave my review here, go into this with an open heart, an open mind and an open box of tissues.. We were just Poppy  Ruin there was no beginning to us and no end. Runes kisses varied. They were slow and soft, gentle and featherlight. Then they were hard, fast and ravishing. Both left me breathless. Both made it into the jar. More kisses sewn onto my heart Even though this book states that its YA age 14 upwards I think this is suitable for all ages, i dont think at the age of 14 if I wouldve handled the depth of emotion in this book at that age.. Im not afraid to admit that a few times I just had to set my kindle aside and walk away until my emotions had settled.. Dont go into this thinking youll dodge that emotional bullet like I thought because it will find you.. MY THOUGHTS Starting these characters from such an early age gives you a glimpse into how their little minds worked, from one handshake it signed their fate as best friends for eternity, even back then you could feel that undeniable bond that these two carried in their hearts. This is so different to any other book Ive read by this author, shes definitely upped her game with this book. Ive only ever had 2x books that made me fugly cry and they were Only when it rains by Lisa De Jong, and When I fall by Christine Zolenze, this book brutally kidnapped me and placed me in the twilight zone of emotional overload, it ripped me to shreds, the feels came at me like a rollercoaster of its tracks, the story line right from the start gripped me in its hand, had me by the throat until that very last page was read.. I laughed, I cried, I loved and yet again I cried and cried and when an author can bring out that strong emotion from an unemotional person deserves more than my 5 stars..

By Stephanie Perkins Summary: Anna was looking forward to her senior year in Atlanta, where she has a great job, a loyal best friend, and a crush on the verge of becoming more. So shes less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris  until she meets Etienne St. Clair. Smart, charming, beautiful, Etienne has it all . . . including a serious girlfriend. But in the City of Light, wishes have a way of coming true. Will a year of romantic nearmisses end with their longawaited French kiss? Stephanie Perkins keeps the romantic tension crackling and the attraction high in a debut guaranteed to make toes tingle and hearts melt. My Thoughts: As most of you know who follow my blog I have been wanting this book so bad!!!! So when it came as a surprise, I started jumping up and down yelling Yes, Yes, Yes! I read it the night I got it until late, than got up the next morning to finish it. I had a migrane so bad from not getting much sleep the next morning but it was worth every single second! My boyfriend wanted to turn off the bedroom light and I kept begging for 10 more minutes, 10 more minutes please! I didnt want to stop! Stephanie Perkins, how did you manage to make me fall in love with this book the way you did? I mean, I cant eat, I cant sleep, I cant think anything except how wonderful Anna is and how now I must go to Paris! Ive always wanted to go to Paris but now I must go there! HEHE! Im going to start off this review and just break down all the elements of the story I liked. I dont want to give away major spoilers but I must talk about this book! I could talk and talk and talk and talk forever! Nothing I could say will describe how much I loved this book. First off, we start off getting to know a little bit about Anna Oliphant. Her father is a published author, her brother Sean is allergic to red dye 40 I thought I was the only one her mom seems nice enough, and she is starting her senior year in a foreign country nope not at Clairemont High as planned. She has friends at Clairemont named Bridgette her best friend, Matt her exboyfriend aka friend and of course Toph her soon to be boyfriend aka coworker. She is going to miss prom, miss senior year classes, miss senior year activities, ARRGG! Her father sends her away to a new school, a new city, a new life. Her first night in Paris and she meets new friends. Meredith, who is her neighbor and the cute guy she bumps into in the hallway just outside Merediths room. Who is he? Etienne St Clair!! He has dark brown messy hair, hes short, brown eyes, beautiful, and English. Of course as soon as they lay eyes on one another, the chemistry is there. The next day she gets introduced to the other people of the group, Rashmi and Josh. There were so many characters throughout the book and I loved them all. Well, except for Ellie St Clairs girlfriend. Of course I wanted her out of the picture from day one! All the characters were great and each had their own personality and brought a lot to the book. Anna was constantly around them so it made for a lot of laughs, deep conversations, etc. Anna also loved movies. She loved reviewing them. I love movies so I can understand how seeing old classics on the screen for her was like a dream come true. Anna was such a sweet character. She was nice, she was easy to get along with, I just felt like she became my friend while reading the book. The scenery in the book was beautiful. Perkins did such a great job describing everything I actually felt like I was in Paris. I could see the people walking around, I could taste the coffee, I could just feel the foreign presence of everything. The emotional aspect of the book made me want to cry for St Clair. His mom gets sick, and its so hard on him. Hes such a tough guy most of the time that I just wanted to hold his hand and let him cry in my lap. Sorry Anna, but if he comes knocking at my door I will answer! LOL. Some of the scenes, okay most of the scenes were so freaking amazing. When he scoots his boot over to grab the nasty note about Anna before the teacher does, when they go see movies together, when he turns around and packs her clothes while she changes, and he glances up and their eyes meet in the mirror oops. Every scene was amazing! I even loved how he was afraid of heights and he was short! Most of the time I forgot he was short, he had so much confidence about him that he just came off as such a great wonderful guy. St Clair and Anna make the perfect pair; best friendsmovie watcherssleep mateslovers. And girl scout cookies, oh my! Thin mints are my favorite and I loved how Perkins included this scene! She put everything I want in a book in her book! She is an amazing debut author!!! Next, I want to talk about Anna and St Clair. The romantic tension was so hot I felt like I was going to pass out. There were moments I laughed, but mostly there were moments I was in love. I usually stay away from the sex aspects in book reviews because I feel like once a character jumps into bed with another character, I start to get bored. I want to see sexual chemistry where the characters dont fall into bed with each other right away. I want to see them fall in love with each other. I want to see their love grow before anything happens. Does that make sense? Well, Perkins does this in exactly the way I want and it blew me totally away. St Claire is amazing. The way he comes to her rescue with Dave, the way he runs to Ellie after the night of the kiss, the way he paces across his room floor. How can you not fall in love with this guy? Even while Anna went home for a few weeks, and St Clair was in California and their only communication was emailsphone conversations I still fell more in love with him. The chemistry and tension between Anna and St Clair is not only hot but sexy,interesting, charming, and just freaking awesome! The way they steal glances at one another, the way they talk, the way she notices his bottom teeth and how they are a bit crooked HOT, the way he calls her beautiful, the way they dance together on the dance floor, his accent,the way when he finally kisses her I had a big grin on my face! I cant say much more about Anna And The French Kiss that wont be said a million times by fans. Anna is amazing. Anna is a book you do not want to miss. If you read one book this whole entire year, please let it be Anna!!!! Sneak PeakDO NOT READ THIS if you dont want a sneak peak into the bed scene. Why are you still reading? LOL Snippets of the bed scene: He stops before me, scanning my face. Would it be okay if I stayed with you? I dont want to make you uncomfortable No! I mean... My head swims. I can hardly think straight. Yes, Yes, of course, its okay. Overall: Was Anna as amazing as I had hoped for? Oui! This review is long! I could write 10 more paragraphs about it though! HAHA! I read a lot of books as most of you know and Im introduced to a lot of good books but Anna And The French Kiss had that sort of element that Jennifer Echols Forget You had. If youve read my review for that, you know how much I loved that book. Its been a while since Ive fallen so completely in love with a book and Perkins brought me back to that feeling. That feeling where I wish the book was real life and I was the main character! Anna was a dream come true! Perkins took everything I wished someone would write and made it a reality for me. Merci beaucoup. Cover: Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! I love every little detail about the cover! What Id Give It: 55 cupcakes
Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog Passenger by Alexandra Bracken Book One of the Passenger series Publisher: DisneyHyperion Publication Date: January 5, 2016 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC sent by the publisher Summary from Goodreads: passage, n. i. A brief section of music composed of a series of notes and flourishes. ii. A journey by water; a voyage. iii. The transition from one place to another, across space and time. In one devastating night, violin prodigy Etta Spencer loses everything she knows and loves. Thrust into an unfamiliar world by a stranger with a dangerous agenda, Etta is certain of only one thing: she has traveled not just miles but years from home. And shes inherited a legacy she knows nothing about from a family whose existence shes never heard of. Until now. Nicholas Carter is content with his life at sea, free from the Ironwoodsa powerful family in the coloniesand the servitude hes known at their hands. But with the arrival of an unusual passenger on his ship comes the insistent pull of the past that he cant escape and the family that wont let him go so easily. Now the Ironwoods are searching for a stolen object of untold value, one they believe only Etta, Nicholas passenger, can find. In order to protect her, he must ensure she brings it back to them whether she wants to or not. Together, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the traveler who will do anything to keep the object out of the Ironwoods grasp. But as they get closer to the truth of their search, and the deadly game the Ironwoods are playing, treacherous forces threaten to separate Etta not only from Nicholas but from her path home . . . forever What I Liked: This book has so much buzz surrounding it, which can be good and bad. I loved Brackens Brightly Woven, and Darkest Minds series, and I had a good feeling that I would enjoy this one too. Its just scary when everyone is really excited about reading the book, very few people have actually read it, and you so want it to be amazing! Lucky for me and others, it WAS amazing. Ettas next concern is her violinist debut, which shell perform in a month or so. Shes performing in the Met, where her mother works, when she is suddenly whisked away in time, accompanied by a strange girl who was also at the met. Sophia Ironwood, the girl, is a traveler, and so is Etta. Sophias grandfather, the Grand Master and head of the Ironwood family, has had Etta brought back in time because he wants her to find something that he says her mother stole from him. If she brings it back, hell let her and her mother go. But Etta  and Nicholas Carter, who commandeered the ship that Etta had to be on to get to Grandfather Ironwood  wont let Ironwood win so easily. Nicholas and Etta will travel between continents and time to find the missing object before anyone else does. Im going to be honest  Im struggling to write this review, because I know I wont do this book justice. I know Im giving it four stars 4.5 stars, really, but gosh, this book was lovely. Its written in thirdperson which I love, occasionally alternating POVs, between Etta and Nicholas. We start with Nicholas, in the beginning of the book, which I thought was interesting. Nicholas dreams of owning his own ship preferably SHIPS, and freeing himself from the Ironwood family. Once you get caught in their web, they never let you go  but Nicholas is hoping that this last trip will be his last for them. Carry two women to New York safely, and hes free. But Nicholas has good instincts, and knows something is not quite right, when Etta is confused and lost and has no idea what she is. Nicholas is such an eighteenthcentury gentleman  protective, loyal, strongwilled, stubborn, wellmannered  but he is also so much more. His past and his connections with Ironwood haunt him in ways that I wont mention, but its so sad to see how people treat him. I really like Etta as well  her first appearance on the ship was PERFECT. We meet her in presentday America, when she is about to play in the Met. Shes a violin prodigy, but shes about to discover that she is also a timetraveler, and that her mother kept a whole lot from her. On the ship in the eighteenthcentury, Etta is confused and doesnt know what is happening, and immediately jumps to defend herself something you wouldnt see from an eighteenthcentury lady. Everyone on the ship falls for her  but especially Nicholas, who doesnt leave her side, when she meets Ironwood, when Ironwood tells her his terms and threats, when Etta leaves and tries to escape... Nicholas and Etta agree to journey together across time, and probably for the better, because Etta is not a good traveler. This story was so interesting! Filled with different countries and times, we got to experience a whole range of settings. Bracken really did her research, and every scene felt fresh and unique and different. The jungle one was probably my favorite, as it was a lush setting, but also really defined Nicholas and Ettas relationship they are so funny!. They have days to find the mysterious object and bring it back for Ironwood, and so they follow clues that Ettas mother left her over time. The clues take them to many places, and Nicholas and Etta get to know each other. The romance... ahh, it was beautiful. Nicholas is different from Brackens other male protagonists, like a combination of Liam and North. Hes bossy and manly yet gentlemanly and chivalrous. And Etta is like a flame or a constant spark. I loved the relationship growth, how they grew with and into each other, how things developed. This book is nearly five hundred pages long, so you can bet that there is a lot of character development AND romance development. The romance is very slowburn, although the interest in each other happens quickly. The climax of this story was so enthralling, heartpounding, and terrifying! This book ends on a cliffhanger, which made me very sad but also quite hopeful. The cliffhanger is kind of a devastating one, but you know its going to be not as bad as you think because of a few lines in the very end. Suffice it to say, I NEED Wayfarer, immediately. This ending was cruel! What I Did Not Like: I think the ending is what is docking this books star or halfstar, really. Its a cliffhanger, and a brutal one, at that. Prepare your hearts, readers! And I GUARANTEE you, its not the ending you might be thinking of. I would never have come up with this ending  and Im usually pretty good at predicting endings, before getting more than halfway into the book. This cliffhanger though! Would I Recommend It: I SO recommend this book! Im not usually a fan of timetravel novels  I did LOVE the Ruby Red series by Kerstin Gier  but this book was excellent. The timetravel is a bit different, as is the aim of the story. I cant wait to see how everything ignites in Wayfarer  the ending of this book was cruel in several ways. You dont have to be a timetravel or historical fiction to love this book! Rating: 4.5 stars  rounded down to 4 stars. Such a gorgeous cover, AND a wonderful story  you must preorder this book! Definitely buy or borrow a copy, you do not want to miss this novel. The hype and buzz is totally justified! Now, someone bring me the sequel, please. PLEASE.
Sometimes I get to read a book I dont know much about and it surprises me by being entirely different than what I initially thought. Yes, this is the case, in a very positive way. I knew there was supposed to be a bit of drama surrounding Noah and some mystery in Echos life, but for some reason I still got the wrong impression. This book deals with some though subjects and I deeply enjoy that in a YA book, because as much as I like to read cute love stories, I also need something with a bit more substance. As usual, I will not provide you with a recap of the action in the book  I like to give my readers the opportunity to find out some things by themselves, so Ill get to the pros and cons of the story. Ill start with something that bothered me, because there was only one thing I didnt like: There was a moment when I doubted the fact that I might enjoy this story. It was when Echo tried to take back her old life, to be who she used to be, to date who she used to date. It was forced and I am glad that she realized that some things change while others dont, but life moves on. Also the lack of real friendship in those moments made me want to punch someone; I dont understand how someone can be your friend only if you date someone they approve on . But if Echo didnt have good friends except for one, I guess, Noah had two best friends that were always there for him. They were sometimes playing the goodcopbadcop game  with Beth being so edgy and Isaiah being so easy to win over and maybe thats why they were so fun to be around. I liked many of the scenes with them because they brought a touch of humor into the play, as the situation was pretty tough and hard to handle. Nice dent, man Isaiah rested his hip against the corner of the way as he crossed his tattooed arms over his chest. I appreciate you choosing my locker to beat the  out of. I was looking for an excused never open it again. There is something that most people dont like, but I really do  its the alternating narration between the main characters. I think that it always gives you some precious insights into both characters, such that you can understand their actions and you can relate to their story better. Yes, it also happens for me to not like the way its managed in a book, but this is not the case. I loved the alternation and I got to understand both Echo and Noah so well in every situation that I couldnt be mad when they decided something I didnt quite agree with, because I was on the same page they were. They both went through difficult times and their actions werent always the ones I expected, so I was glad to be able to really see inside them, to follow their thoughts. What makes a story special for me is to be able get attached to the characters. ... And I cared for Echo, because it was really hard for her to be unable to reach the memories of the one moment that defined her in her opinion. Also there was so much tension between Echo and her father, with her blaming him for so many things sometimes not even the ones that mattered and I loved to find out more about their relationship, about their past and even their present, because  you might guess  nothing is the way it seems to be. The social hierarchy at school is not something that I could care about, so I couldnt understand Echos choices in taking back her old life, and being friend with some people who want her to live they way they want, who want her to be the one they like, who want her to talk with people they approve. eyes rolling Just dare telling me what to do or think, and Im gonna put you in your place before you can even say reading after midnight. ... But Noahs story was painful and hard to digest. It was honest and it broke my heart. Struggling to do the right things, wanting his brothers in his life again, hating the system that brought them apart  well this is something I can understand; him wanting his life back is something I can wrap my head around. His only problem was that he was so damn cheesy sometimes  guys dont talk like that, they dont think like that, and the nymph thingy is a bit too much for a bad boy or so I think. My girls would have sufficed... just saying . Some other things that I liked:  The fact that Echo and Noah could still joke and smile and give funnysarcastic lines even when things were far from well;  There was no instalove, in fact the pacing was right. They werent deeply in love as characters tend to be in YA books  they had some serious things to figure out before getting more serious in this relationship, but it was nice for them to feel loved, as they were both so alone in their troubles;  I liked their sessions with the counselor. Even though they didnt want her help, they needed ither so much. And it also brought them closer which is another good thing;  I liked how things ended. I usually complain about the endings, but this one worked for me. Some things got to be the way I wanted them, maybe thats why I am so pleased with it. ... Ill leave the list open for you, as I am sure that youll find so many things to like about this story. Happy midnight reading! Book source: ARC from the publisher via Netgalley.

This book has been on my TBR shelf since August 2010. Prisons are one of my areas of interest. I have been involved with the peace movement a good part of my life and nonviolent civil disobedience is part of the toolbox. Sometimes people end up in jail. I came close but never quite made it. My Mom spent time in jail for crossing the line at a company that manufactured parts for nuclear weapons and also at an actual missile site. Crossing the line is kind of like daring someone. There is a line on the pavement, real or imagined, often at a gate of building entrance and the authorities tell you that if you cross that line, you will be arrested. So you cross the line. I might be making this sound blase but, believe me, it is not. Our author, Piper Kerman, graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1992. I knew there were PIBs in that town. In some places a PIB is a member of the Goth subculture, a Person in Black. In Northampton PIB was a broader term for anyone who routinely wears completely black clothing but is not necessarily Goth. Wearing black was a style rather than a culture. Now you understand what Orange is the New Black means. As a jail inmate, Piper wore mandatory orange when she was first imprisoned. You already knew? Well then forget all that and move on to the next paragraph. Piper wants an adventure after graduating. And she certainly finds one in spades. Bali was a bacchanalia: days and nights of sunbathing, drinking, and dancing until all hours with Noras crew of gay boys, any pretty locals who wanted to help us spend money, and young Euros and Aussies we met in the clubs at Kuta Beach. I went to the street market to buy a bikini and sarong, bartered for carved masks and silver jewelry, and walked the back roads of Nusa Dua talking to the friendly locals. Expeditions to temples, parasailing, and scuba diving offered other diversions  the Balinese scuba instructors loved the longfinned, jeweled, and elegant blue fish that had been tattooed on my neck back in New England and eagerly showed me their own tattoos. She gives a first person view of sex, drugs and rocknroll. But then the adventure ends, she is ultimately charged with drug offenses in federal court, pleads guilty, and waits for the inevitable day she will go to prison. Now, years later, she has taken the time to remember and reflect and write. She changes from the wild, immature young woman to a thoughtful and introspective adult with a story to tell and the skill and patience to write a memoir about it. We meet a lot of the women that Piper met in prison. But this is mostly a story about Piper. When Piper was released she got a job immediately and was successful, even writing a book. But what happened to the other women when they were released? The book doesnt get into that and that is too bad. Most of us never go to a prison even just to visit someone. We dont know those people at all. Piper could have done a lot better job of introducing us. You probably have some events in your life that were measured in years: in school seventeen years; married thirteen years; lived in Lynchburg nine years. Now, imagine a prison sentence: The fact that Id become used to life in prison shocked my friends and family, but no one on the outside can really appreciate the galvanizing effect of all the regimented rituals, whether official or informal. Its the insidious, cruel paradox of lengthy sentences: for women doing seven, twelve, twenty years, the only way to survive was to accept prison as their universe. But how on earth would they survive in the outside world when released? Institutionalized was one of the greatest insults one could throw at another prisoner, but when you resisted the system of control, you suffered swift retribution. Where you fit in and how comfortable you were willing to get depended on the length of your sentence, the amount of contact you had with the outside world, and the quality of your life on the outside. And if you resisted finding a place in prison society, you were desperately lonely and miserable. You have a hard time imagining being in prison seventeen, thirteen or nine years? Think about that knowledge as your reality and your life. Piper is sentenced to fifteen months and assigned to Danbury Prison in Connecticut. Danbury was opened in 1940 and, although it has been a womens prison since 1993, it was for men and women prior to that. When Piper was there Danbury consisted of a minimum security camp at the top of the hill and a separate secure facility down the hill. It is strange but I feel like Danbury is an old friend. Conscientious objectors were imprisoned there in the 1940s for refusing to cooperate with the military draft. Peace activists were sent there during the Vietnam War. Political activists Phil and Dan Berrigan were also imprisoned at Danbury as a part of the plowshares movements e.g. swords into plowshares. Piper shares the experience of a woman being in prison with her readers. You might expect the food to be pretty lousy, and it is. When you read the recipe for Prison Cheesecake made by the inmates for special occasions with ingredients from the commissary and pilfered from the kitchen, your mouth will not water. You may expect the inmates to be a pretty rough crowd. Surprisingly, they are for the most part not at all threatening. You will learn some things about prison life and some stereotypes will be shattered. There are no locked cells in this minimum security prison. But if you have heard that some prisons are like country clubs or Club Fed, you will find that not to be the case either. Kerman is not a wordsmith. The language will not overly impress you. But the thoughts expressed might move you to think about this part of life that is unknown to us. Her writing early in the book about her life that eventually got her into trouble reflects the frenetic pace of that life, her crashing down and her temporary escape to try to rebuild. Her past life did come back to bite her! What is wrong with the womens prison system? Piper would say that one of the biggest problems is that so little is done to prepare the women for life on the outside. But here is another one that I think is pretty huge: But what was striking about Ms. Wilson, and was also true of the other outsiders who volunteered their time that day, was that she spoke to us prisoners with great respect, as if our lives ahead had hope and meaning and possibility. After all these months at Danbury, this was a shocking novelty. ...spoke to us prisoners with great respect... What a concept! Is there a moral to this story? I generally think there must be a moral to every story but sometimes we cant figure it out or dont care what it is. This might be the moral of Orange Is the New Black: If there was one thing I had learned in the Camp, it was that I was in fact good. I wasnt so good with chickenshit rules, but I was more than capable of helping other people. I was eager to offer what I had, which was more than I had realized. Judging others held little appeal to me now, and when I did it, I regretted it. Best of all, I had found other women here in prison who could teach me how to be better. It seemed to me that my total demonstrated failure at being a good girl was more than matched by the urgency of being a good person. And that was something of which I hoped my grandmother would approve, and maybe forgive me, when I could not attend to her suffering. I am sure that the prison bureaucracy would say that this proves that they do rehabilitate people! Such bullshit! I am going to give this book four stars but I really didnt like all of it quite that much. But I am glad to have read the book and it kept me reading. The justice system deserves some exposure to those of us who are paying the bills. We shouldnt feel too good about it. I met quite a few nasty people in this book and most of them were not inmates.
This. Book. Wins. If this had been the book given to me as my first foray into comtemporary YA  and granted, it has supernatural elements, what with the MC being dead and all  anyway, had this been my first contemporary read, it might have easily led me to decide that contemps were my favorite subgenre. Instead, Ive shied away from most anything contemporary and consistently read paranormals with a heavy dose of romance to satisfy my cravings. This book may have changed all that. Dont think that means that Ill forego supernatural stories in favor of lighter, fluffier reads. But I will give all contemps a second thought, instead of immediately dismissing them due to their lack of imaginary beasties. The Catastrophic History of You  Me is not a book Ill soon forget. Its cute, funny, heartbreaking, sad, beautiful, honest, and a whole slew of other adjectives. Pretty much, I ran a full gamut of emotions while reading this novel. I teared up  okay, bawled like a baby because I tend to be overly sentimental  twice within the first two chapters alone. But I also laughed  a lot  throughout the book. And I swooned...oh, did I swoon. Basically, this book takes you through the five stages of grief denial, anger, bargaining, sadness, and acceptance as Brie deals with each of them after her death. And shes got dreamy lost soul Patrick to help her through them. Cue the swooning. I absolutely adored the voice given to Brie. Shes witty and sarcastic and well, adorable, even when she makes some questionable decisions. But honestly, who among us wouldnt take the opportunity to spy on our loved ones after were gone? The story was one of redemption, of love lost and found again, and of understanding and compassion when others need it most. I thoroughly enjoyed the subtle hints placed throughout the story, and though I figured out what was really going on halfway through, I was still pleasantly surprised at how it came to fruition. It was slightly predictable without being obvious. Also, the chapters are titled after songs, some of them popular love songs, some of them corny songs from the 80s. And Brie herself is a big fan of 80s music. Because I really needed a reason to love her more. You want to know something else Ive decided I like about contemporary novels? A lot of them are standalone novels. I love a good series as much as the next girl, but sometimes, you just want to finish a novel in one sitting and revel in that sense of accomplishment, in knowing how the story ends without having to wait for the next installment. So, theres another plus for this story...as if I needed another one. : I will recommend this debut novel to everyone, and I mean everyone. And if theres any doubt as to why, see the first paragraph of this review again. Its not everyday that a novel can convert me to the lighter side of YA. And now, one of my favorite passages from the book. Mind you, this is taken from the ARC I received and may not appear in the final version of the novel...but Ill be really sad to find out if it doesnt make the cut. From pages 42  44: I crossed my arms and clenched my jaw, feeling my inner fiveyearold beginning to act out. I. Dont. Have. A. Pen. She pointed at my right hand. Yes. You. Do. Before I could argue with her, I realized that actually, I did have a pen. Right in my hand, ready to go. I almost fell off my chair. How the hell did that get there?! The weirdest part? I recognized it. No. Way. It was the exact same pen Id had back in third grade. Back when I was an even bigger dork who got so excited I couldnt sleep before School Supply Shopping Day. The pen was white on top and sky blue on bottom, with six six! color options, depending on which button you pushed down. You could even press two buttons down at the same time and mix the colors. I know. To a thirdgrade bookworm whod spent her entire summer practicing her signature in cursive, this pen was a complete and total thing of beauty. Id left it in my desk one Friday afternoon, but when I looked for it the following Monday morning, it was gone. Were talking Real Life Elementary School Tragedy. But then, in a very suspicious turn of events, Chloe Lutza girl who wore her hair in pigtails every day, for gods sakeshowed up with a similar and by similar I mean identical pen a few days later. Et tu, Chloe? I knew she took it. Emma, Sadie, and Tess knew she took it. But tattling wasnt an option because our teacher Mrs. Arden had a very harsh NoTattling policy. I wanted to confront her at recess, but I figured that was a bad idea, considering a she was a whole foot taller than me and b she was a brown belt in karate. In the end, I spent the whole rest of that school year watching Chloe have the time of her life pushing my beloved color buttons. Red! No, blue! Oh, isnt this fun? Yes, Chloe Slutz, of course its fun. That is obviously why I bought it. And now, all these years later, here I was in a grungy pizza parlor in Half Moon Bay, dead since Monday, and holding the very same Worlds Greatest Pen. SO weird. First, I had that pen! Second, I think that passage highlights how funny and normal Brie is, and it gives you a little insight into her character. Not a huge fan of the trailer, but here it is anyway:  This review can also be found at The StarryEyed Revue.
Actual Rating: 4.5 stars This book was enchantingly beautiful, hauntingly ambiguous, and magically mesmerizing. I adored it. Fair warning here: The book is a really slow paced. Its not a book you can rush through and expect to truly experience it all. Personally Im not used to such slow books and I often dont enjoy them, but this one was really captivating because even though it was slow, the plot, characters, and descriptions still catch your attention. The writing was immensely beautiful. At first, I didnt really know how I felt about the switching narratives from the third person omniscient to second person. By the middle of the book, I got used to it and liked it enough. One of the most important aspects was the setting, and I think Morgenstern spent a lot of time portraying it out so elaborately and beautifully which made the book feel so much more engaging. It was like you, yourself, were walking through the circus, feeling and seeing everything that was going on. It was sensational! There were a lot of characters; A lot more than I expected at least. I had a little trouble remembering them all at the beginning, but theyre all so distinguished and well written that eventually it became easier to differentiate them all. The love story... It felt like it was going to be the most important aspect in the book, but I didnt feel that way. I felt like the love story was like a secondary story that helped push the aspect of The Night Circus along. Does that make sense? I did enjoy Marco and Celia. Theyre not my OTP or anything though. I loved the concept of The Night Circus. I really wish that it was real and I could just go and visit it. The idea of it is dreamlike and hopeful and purely amazing. SPOILERS DOWN BELOW!!!! Oh my gosh can we please just talk about how crazy Hector Bowen is?!?!? He is like batshit insane! I was just cringing every time he slit open Celias fingers and made her magically repair them and then did it all over again! AGH. image error I really liked the background story about Prospero and Grey suit. It was interesting to read about how Grey suit was Prosperos teacher and he like splintered from him and started teaching as well but with more modern tactics. Its weird how even though Grey suit is older and was Prosperos teacher, he still has some feelings and morals while Prospero is like cold and apathetic even towards his own daughter. Marco and Celias relationship was really interesting. Its funny how they got together over half way through the book and their romance is sort of lustful and felt a little rushed. Maybe its because they were kind of already in love with each others magic and the tents they madethe feelings those tents elicited. Or maybe it was because they were bonded by those rings and Tsukiko was describing how when theyre bonded, their worlds are kind of dependent on each other. I dont know, but I did really enjoy their romance. It was sort of cheesy but I tend to love those kinds of romances. A lot of people dont like Marco because of what he did to Isobel which I agree was a total dick move, but I just didnt feel for Isobel. She was kind of irrelevant to me personally. I didnt really feel a connection with her and I didnt care about her feelings. In fact, I was kind of pissed off when she ruined the balance of the circus for revenge which led to the death of Herr Theussien :. But dont get me wrong I do feel for her. I get how she was really hurt and was kind of led on by Marco. Pretty much everything she has been doing was for him and to help him in the competition, but I guess I just felt more for Celia. Maybe it was because Celia was more drawn out and easier to relate to...? I dont know. I really, really, really adored Poppet and Bailey. Theyre probably my favorite pairing in this book. I just couldnt handle it. I liked Widget, Poppet, and Bailey as individual characters as well. All throughout the story, I was just so curious as to why we were following the perspective of Bailey. I kept asking myself, Whats his significance? At first I thought his POV would show how the circus was like after the competition because of the timeline. But then! The different POV timelines started catching up with each other. I was so confused. I liked Baileys story: his struggle with change and moving from the farm and not becoming his father and escaping to Harvard. I knew he was going to run away with the circus and I was so excited because I really wanted him and Poppet to get together. Their relationship was cutesy and adorable. And I just really like how Bailey represented everything the Night Circus is about. Its the Circus of dreams... It gives people hope, inspiration, dreams, chances, and an escape. Its not just a place for fun and games, it has a deeper meaning to it. It inspired and enchanted so many people who had this passion for the circus. It had that much influence. It carried that much hope and love. Bailey loved the Circus. He chose it. I loved how the guy on the train said that Bailey reminded him of Herr Theussien because if he hadnt died I wouldve thought that hed be the one to take over the circus. My favorite character was probably Poppet or Tsukiko. I really liked Poppet and her personality. Her readingspredictions were really interesting. I was just trying to keep track of them all. Lets see... She predicted Tara being buried. She predicted the red paint which was Herr Theussiens blood. She predicted the whole firepit event thingy. Tuskiko was a really intriguing character. When we found out that she was a former student of Grey suit, I was like... image error I loved her background story and her character in general. I liked all of the other characters. Did anyone else think Herr Theussien and Celia were secretly dating in the beginning? I loved their friendship to be honest. They loved each other and shared the same passion commitment for the circus. What I really loved was Widget and Grey suits conversation at the end. It was filled so many ideas and stories. I loved Grey suits part of the conversation. And that ending...It was brilliantly written. The entire third person narrative is essentially Widget telling the story of the circus to Grey suit. Am I right? Loved it. Favorite Quotes from the Book 1. The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones. 2. I prefer to remain unenlightened, to better appreciate the dark. 3. Most maidens are perfectly capable of rescuing themselves in my experience, at least the ones worth something, in any case. 4. There are no longer simple tales with quests and beasts and happy endings... The beasts take different forms and are difficult to recognize for what they are. 5. Good and evil are a great deal more complex than a princess and a dragon, or a wolf and a scarletclad little girl. And is not the dragon the hero of his own story? Is not the wolf simply acting as a wolf should act? 6. But dreams have ways of turning into nightmares. So I dont think this book is going in my favorites pile even though I loved it a lot. I think Im a little detached to it for some reason. Maybe its the narrative. But either way, this book was really great and Im really glad it was chosen for my schools book club book of the month. I initially thought I wasnt going to like it. Boy was I wrong. Happy reading :
I dont even know how to begin this review. This series, The Lunar Chronicles is my favorite series of all time, and Ive been waiting to read this book for over a year and a half now. As you can tell, my expectations for this book were pretty high going in, and it did not disappoint me. Marissa Meyer is an incredible story teller, and I admire the way she weaves all the character story lines together. Its amazing. I have grown such a deep love for each and every one of these characters. My personal favorites are Cinder, Thorne, and Cress,but I truly do love them all. Im so happy that each one of them got plenty of time to develop and have their own stories throughout this book. Winter was an interesting addition to the group, as she suffers from extreme hallucinations and decides not to use her Lunar gift when she has the ability to. But I adored Winter. I love how she called everyone by their name and then added friend to the end of it. Cinderfriend. Scarletfriend. Its so sweet. I like that she respects people enough to never want to manipulate them. She even has scarring all across her face, but she doesnt use her glamour to cover it up. Shes an all around inspiring person, and I absolutely loved her. I also loved seeing her friendship with Scarlet grow throughout this book. They made a really cute pair of friends. This book was actionpacked from the very beginning and it kept a steady pace throughout the entire book. This book is 823 pages, which is officially the longest book Ive ever read, but I flew through it and finished it in 4 days. That says a lot about the way this book captivates you and its hard to put it down. I will miss this series and these characters so much. Its hard to really talk about this book without giving any spoilers away, but just know that I truly loved this book and this series is my favorite. Thorne and Cress are forever my OTP and I just adore them like crazy. I also love the brothersister relationship that Thorne and Cinder seem to have. Theyre adorable. I have a soft spot in my heart for Scarlet and Wolf because I honestly feel throughout the series they have been through the most as a couple. Cinder and Kai were insanely adorable as they always are in every book of the series. And Winter and Jacin became a new favorite of mine. They were really cute. Levana was incredibly evil throughout this book, as was expected and I loved to hate her. I do wish there were more Snow White references in this book I only noticed one but maybe I missed the others? I didnt notice any mention of seven dwarfs unless that is supposed to be cinders crew? and that was slightly disappointing. I cant dive deeper into my likes and dislikes without giving spoilers. This is one of my favorite books of 2015 and ever. SPOILERS BELOW Where do I even begin? I guess my biggest disappointment with this story is the way Levana died... I feel like the entire purpose of this series was the build up to killing Levana, and her death scene was very unsatisfying. Its kind of unclear how she even died.. Did Cinder actually shoot her? Where did she get shot? Did she die instantly? I cant help but be curious about these things. I didnt even know Levana was dead until Kai told Cinder, and I feel like her death should have been a much bigger scene than it was. Thats my 1 issue with this story. My other issue was that I wish it were a little less confusing when Levana was manipulating people and using her glamour to look like someone else. At times I would get confused what was happening because Levana was using her glamour to look like Cinder, but I actually thought it was Cinder because the writing made it a little unclear. One of my favorite scenes in the book is when Levana disguises herself as an old lady and gives Winter the two apples. I had been waiting for a scene like this throughout the entire book and I was so excited when it finally happened! And then when Winter bit into the apple, she got the plague! I love how Marissa Meyer puts her own spin on the original fairytale. Its so creative and aksjdlaks I love it. And also when they put Winter in the glass tank and she was in front of a huge crowd, I pictured it just like the fairytale of Snow White. It was so awesome. Another scene that I really love and want to remember is when Cinder plays a video to all of Luna telling her shes princess Selene and shes coming to take her crown, and then Levana stream a video where she says shes an impostor and she forces Kai to also say shes an impostor. That was so intense! I also loved the scene where Thorne and Cress go to the Queens coronation together and he kisses that other girl because she looks like Cress. And then Thorne and Cress finally have their adorable moment and they kiss and its passionate and dramatic and he practically admits hes in love with her. It was so freaking cute I was squealing and I had been waiting for a scene like that the whole book! That scene alone made this book worth 5 stars. I thought that scene with Levana at the end was so intense because she was using all of Cinders friends against her, and making them fight Cinder and fight each other. It was interesting and I wasnt expecting it to happen that way. Cress ended up shooting off Thornes fingers and Thorne ended up stabbing Cress and Cinder. It was a very intense scene and I loved every second of it right up until Levanas death. I just wish it was more epic, like Cinder got the satisfaction right in that moment of killing her, instead of finding out about it later. It was all very underwhelming. I absolutely loved the scene with Cress and Thorne in the hospital at the end, and they said I love you to each other. The final scene with Cinder and Kai was interesting. In the end, Cinder didnt even want to become the Queen of Luna which was both disappointing and understandable. I saw it coming from a mile away, but I was still disappointed because I feel like she would have been a great ruler and that was her goal the whole time. I dont know how I feel yet about Cinder allowing Adri to become rich off of her dads invention. Adri is a bitch who doesnt deserve it but at the same time Im proud of Cinder for being the bigger person. I honestly was expecting someone to die until I remember this is a fairy tale retelling so of course theyll all live happily ever after. But I still think it would have been a crazy, unexpected plot twist if one of the got killed off in the end. I think it would have been more realistic at least. I have a lot of mixed feeling about the way it actually ended, but overall this book was absolutely amazing. This series has been an incredible ride and I miss it already.
We are The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Club, to know more about this book, go to the post in our website: White Hot Kiss The Dark Elements, 1 by Jennifer L. Armentrout If you are interested, you can visit our website: The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Club The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Clubs Review: Rate: 5 stars Review: Recently I had the pleasure to enter to the new magical world that Jennifer L. Armentrout wrote thanks to Lisa from Harlequin Teen. And I am more than grateful, because Ms. Armentrout is an amazing writer and she proves it once again with White Hot Kiss. Not only she created an amazing story worth of a series of books that would leave you wanting for more, but a dark and dangerous romance, forbidden love, an adventure that if they fail it would set loose the Apocalypse and an unbelievable, heartbreaking and astonishing ending. White Hot Kiss has the very signature of Ms. Armentrout, because it reminded me a little bit of the Lux Series, but not quite the same. Well, not at all. In this series, the gargoyles who protect the humans from the demons. But these past years, the increase of demons in the human world made the gargoyles go public. Layla works with the wardens, also her family, marking demons for them to make their work easier. Meeting Roth in the process was not planned. He turns her world up side down and makes her doubt everything she knew. However, what started as a job for Roth and a merely curiosity for Layla turns out to be a dangerous path that could destroy everything. Laylas world is dark, intense, dangerous and simply addictive. I was addicted with her story from the very first page and didnt want to finish it. The story has the two perfects factions of good and evil: wardens and demons. However, throughout the story, theres a point when those lines are blurred and the author makes you doubt in which side you are really on. Jennifer L. Armentrouts characters are simply amazing. The main character, Layla is one of Armentrouts heroines, but with a dark side. Being part demon and part warden is not easy and the character has some difficult moments that made her be kind of insecure and doubt everything. Despite this, shes also funny and has a peculiar humor that made me laugh all the time. Plus her badass side brought a little action in the perfect situations. Roth is the perfect representation of a bad guy: he is dangerous, badass and has this Iamalwaysright attitude characteristic from other famous bad boys like Klaus Mikaelson and Damon Salvatore. Even if you always like more the good guy, Roth will steal your heart. He always reminds Layla what hes, but he has some sweet moments that shows us that he really cares for Layla and that simply melt my heart. Zaynes the good boy in this love triangle. Hes shown as that boy next door that always takes care of the girl, protecting her like a brother. And that simply makes the girl fall, head over heels, for him. Since Layla and Zayne grew up together, they are like brothers, have this great connection and chemistry that is only shown in a couple thats comfortable around each other. Despite this, Im simply glad that Layla was not hitting on her brother. That would be beyond awkward. But I wouldnt mind having a brother like Zayne you know what I mean wink, wink. I would venture to say that Zayne, Roth and Layla are one of my favorite love triangles, not only for its level of hotness and great chemistry, but because they are simply epic. One one hand we have the good Zayne, trying to protect and save Layla all the time. Hes the golden boy. As for Roth, hes the bad guy who turns out to be good after all, but without denying what he really is. I liked the fact that he warns Layla about being soulless and because of that he cannot feel love. The impossible love, plus the forbidden touch because of Roth being a demon, was one of the main reasons that made me choose Roth over Zayne. The story has a good plot and the unraveling secrets that we get to know while reading Laylas discovers are shocking as well as new for the readers. Not at all expected, and thats one of the things that makes the reader addicted to know more. As for the paranormal touch in White Hot Kiss, I would have never imagined to have such a crush on both demons and wardens, but I have it now. The author brings dangerous, good and sexy together and with a slightly Supernatural TV Show touch creating a paranormal story in which the fate of the world is involved. Finishing White Hot Kiss was the hardest part for me. Not that it was difficult because it was bad, but because I didnt want it to end. And saying that it broke my heart to read those last chapters, is not nearly enough to the actual heartbreaking I felt. I like that about Jennifers story: always the unexpected can happen and those situations that you think no, thats too cruel to happen it does. So, I would only say that she left a big open finale that would make The Dark Elements fans scream for the second book. Am I one of those fans? How do you dare question that. Of course, I am! Jennifer L. Armentrout has the great ability to swoon readers and captivate them with her stories and The Dark Elements is simply a reminder of that. With new mindblowing characters and an incredible story that would leave you speechless, White Hot Kiss not only was an incredible and epic read, it exceeded my expectations. And the only thing that would be left in White Hot Kiss would a warning sign: Warning, this story might be addictive. I highly recommend this book, as in leaveeverythingyouredoingandstartnow, and thats one of the main reasons White Hot Kiss won a welldeserved five gorjuss dolls. Dream Cast: Alex Pettyfer as Zayne Claire Holt as Layla Jordan Legault as Roth
The reason I read this book is because EVERYONE would not shut up about it. So I bought all three of them like I usually do with trilogies etc. I was expecting something really sexy, exciting and I also expected myself to fall in love with the character of Christian Grey. Needless to say, none of that happened. The sex scenes were weird. BDSM doesnt really do it for me. I do not find any pleasure in pain whatsoever, so I didnt enjoy reading about how a girl like Anastasia Steele, who was a virgin like 5 minutes ago, enjoys all the hard spanking and I do mean hard and not sexy spanking and much more of his secret sexual life. I thought that the book would have more of a plot, but no... just Anastasia falling for Christian and Christian who is a gazillionaire who is all about the business and can make any woman fall for him just by looking at her, stalks Anastasia like a jealous teenager and acts like a damn 12 year old. Also, his over protectiveness just put me off. Dont get me wrong, I am all about the man doing romantic gestures and taking care of the woman he loves, making sure she is safe and whatever, but this was just paranoid... Anastasia seems really stupid. I know she is all innocent and etc... but come on! get a life, girl... Her friend Kate seemed to have a more interesting storyline and I thought her character was kind of cool in the beginning until she hooked up with fiftys Christians brother Elliot how convenient, who from what was described of him, seems like a surfer dude with no brain whatsoever. Seriously, whenever he talked I kept imagining the dialogues from that 80s or 90s Keanu Reeves movie Bill and Ted or the turtles from Finding Nemo. So anyway, back to Christian Grey. I dont know when that guy actually works, because all he seems to do is go on helicopter rides and follow Anastasia everywhere she goes. It seemed like a waste of a huge office building and a waste of employees if you are not actually going to go to work, Mr. Grey... but then again, I dont know...maybe he is helping the economy by helping unemployed people... Christian also seems to have an issue with food. Anastasia never seems to eat and that just makes him even more crazy. He also describes himself as fifty shades of grey which I thought was funny. I have never heard of anyone describing themselves as shades of a color before. I do think that E L James had already thought of the title before even putting that line in the book. I would be happy if she didnt put it in the book at all. There really is no point in justifying the book title you chose, Mrs. E L James. Just name it what you like. You named the character GREY after all, and he is complex and has about 50000000 dark secrets...we get it. There is also this meaningless storyline between Anastasia and her friend Jose, who likes her, makes a pass at her and Christian comes to the rescue. Nothing to add to this, cause I saw it coming. So classic. Also, the one thing that made me really cringe, was the tampon bit... She was on her period. It was the second day of her period, and Christian just pulled out her tampon, threw it in a sink or in the toilet or something like that, and then had sex with her. WHAT???!!! Disgusting...just...I dont know...that was soooo not sexy. Who does that? How could a girl even feel comfortable for a guy to just pull out her tampon? is that even right? How is he not disgusted? That scene really put me off. All I could think of was how is it possible for his penis not to look like it was murdered and cut to pieces with all the blood coming out of her? And yet, they also have a bath together after that. Great...more blood...flowing on the bathtub water...eeewww!. But E L James says nothing about the blood. We just have to assume that Anastasia has some sort of magical super powerful vagina that only bleeds for one day once a month and once someone takes her tampon out the blood flow just stops. Anyway, Christian falls in love with her like we didnt see that coming and she falls in love with him. This was also something I did not like. We all know its a trilogy, so I would have enjoyed it more if they had not fallen in love from the first book. I also found myself skimming through some of the sex scenes, cause it all seemed the same to me after a certain point. Anastasia says oh my! 1000000 times they have sex and every time she even looks at him. I also dont need the constant reminder that he is really good looking. I know. You told me. After the 100th time it gets a bit annoying, Anastasia. Also, Christian chooses a girl as a submissive, has them sign a contract or whatever so they agree to do whatever he wants in his playroom or red room of pain in order to please him. Well, Mr. Grey, if you dont mind me saying, you have damn serious issues... I know he is supposed to be surviving his childhood memories and whatever, but come on... who buys into that? His storyline about being adopted and his mother being a crack whore just reminded me of the tv show Dexter. The story was similar to me because of Dexter watching his mother being murdered and therefore turning into a serial killer. When it comes to Dexter, I get it. Christian Grey...not so much... Also, the whole Mrs. Robinson story was kind of...eh...boring. I didnt care for her. Nor did I feel sorry for Christian. He was 15 and he had a chance with an older woman. Any boy would do that, I think. It all just seemed to easy to me. It seemed that he fell for her immediately making it even more unrealistic than it already is. The fact that he has a helicopter and a house in every damn state and country is also frustrating. How does one person who never goes to work but spends his time running behind a 21 year old, manage to keep all his assets and keep track of everything going on with his staff? Also, Christian seems to be wearing the same tie all the time. You would think someone like him would have a thousand ties, yet he still always wears the same one, which is kind of gross considering he keeps using it to tie her up when they have sex, and he never seems to wash it. By the way, I dont care about Anastasias inner goddess. It made me hate her. And dont even get me started on her subconscious.... Why does she explain to us what happened when we JUST read it a few seconds ago? All in all I just wanted to say that I dont get why this book has become so popular. The only reason I can think of is because of the graphic sex scenes. Which, to be honest, were not even that graphic. Good for E L James who managed to make a mediocre story with no particular plot so damn popular. I give this book 1,5 stars out of 5 because I did want to know where the author was going with all this. And I really wanted to finish it so I could get on to the next one in order to have a full opinion on the trilogy that has caused so much debate.
Okay, I admit it  I went into this novel thinking Id hate the epistolary format. Having just finished Maggie Stiefvaters The Dream Thieves, I really didnt expect for this book to hold my attention while I waited for Blue Lily, Lily Blue to come in from the library. I guess I had a lot of preconceived notions about epistolary novels, some of which were given fuel by reviews Ive read on Goodreads. Mostly, though, I was just afraid to try something new. Welp. I was wrong. So, so wrong. Its not often that I say this about a book, but oh my goodness, I loved Illuminae. LOVED. In fact, I think Illuminae has slapped me with my worst book hangover of 2015. I feel bad that I went into this story thinking Id dislike it for its differences from more traditional novels, especially because thats exactly why I enjoyed it so much. At the risk of being extremely basic, here are some of Illuminaes main and imo, most compelling plot points: SPACE COMPUTER HACKERS A BADASS HEROINE and heroes SWOONY LOVE AI WITH QUESTIONABLE SANITY ... Zombies? NonSpoilery Summary: Illuminae is a series of files which mainly focus on characters named Kady Grant and Ezra Mason. Set on two different spaceships fleeing a corporation which has brutally attacked Kady and Ezras home planet, Kerenza, the story bounces between several settings and characters in order to fully explain events. Using audio transcriptions, instant messages, surveillance footage, AI narration, and even vivid illustrations the rose was my favorite, Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff created a novel that is totally unique in both plot and format. As the files unfold, so does the story of our main characters, particularly Kady. A badass computer hacker who is witty, sarcastic, and brave, Kady is a fantastic character to follow and root for  even when everything falls apart. What I loved spoilers hidden: Honestly, I loved just about everything. From the very beginning Illuminae runs at breakneck speed, but that momentum never sacrifices character or plot development like some other novels do. Kaufman and Kristoff deftly incorporate a delicate love story, an entire fleet of commanders with questionable morality, bloodthirsty victims of a horrific attack, TWO spaceships, and a ticking clock throughout the novel that had me gripping the book with actual fear and DISTRESS. I had to read Illuminae with the lights on, because honestly, so much of it is either heartracing or straightup scary. Against my expectations, I also deeply connected with the characters. Kady Grant is a badass computer hacker YES, a girl hacker!!!, and Ezra Mason is an absolutely lovable jock and Cyclone pilot I thought of Cyclones like Gundams. At first I found their love story a little unbelievable, especially considering that they lost everything to a horrible attack on their home planet. But Ezra and Kady have incredibly strong voices, and as their connection to one another unfolded, it became impossible for me not to connect with them. Through instant messages they work together and come together, rebuilding a relationship that was broken by a secret in Ezras past. Along with Ezra theres also Byron Zhang, a computer hacker whos more or less trained Kady. The instant messages between Zhang and Ezra give readers a platform to understand all characters and their voices. We also get extra insight into Kady from journal entries, which I think really endeared me to her. Kady has lost almost everything, yet shes still willing and able to fight for what little she has left. As the story unfolds, its obvious that Kady is an unstoppable character. I loved that about her, from beginning to end. Illuminae asks a lot of the reader, and I thought of it like a puzzle. As you read you get hints and clues, and you have to guess and work to piece information together just like the characters are doing. I really enjoyed that. I especially liked the incorporation of the Artificial Intelligence, AIDAN. AIDAN, which commits horrible acts in the name of protecting the fleet is an incredible complex character in the novel. Just like Kady, readers have to figure out whether or not its become insane from critical damage, or if its ability to selfrepair has maintained its supposed ability to remain absolutely logical. There is so much danger in this story from beginning to end: an imminent attack on our two main ships, the Alexander and Hypatia, looms throughout the book; refugees aboard one ship become increasingly ill until they devolve into the Afflicted; AIDAN is considered insane and dangerous, yet shutting it down ensures that the Alexander has no defense mechanisms; Ezra Mason is throttled into space to battle enemies; Kady and Byron try desperately to hack AIDAN and save everyone they can. Through all of that, though, I never lost sight of the core of the story: Kady Grant wants to save the one person she loves, and she wants to make the refugees from her planet safe again. On a different note, I realized something whilst reading Illuminae: this books format is totally accessible to people who dont enjoy reading. When my husband not an avid reader unless it involves sports : saw me reading it, he was so intrigued by the spaceship illustrations, the creative AI narration, and the instant messages. As a former teacher, that made me think about the students I had that didnt like reading for various reasons. I think Illuminae, which feels sort of like a hybrid between a graphic novel and a traditional novel, could really draw in readers who either struggle with reading or maintaining interest in books. That made me really excited, and I hope this book lays the groundwork for more like it. What I wasnt crazy about: My main concern about the epistolary format was that it would distance me too far from the characters, setting, and plot. And to be honest, it did at first. Illuminae requires major suspension of disbelief, especially because it mercilessly throws readers into the world from page 1. Since this novel is told through a series of documents, it also requires patience. Nothing is given away if it isnt necessary, and as a reader you have to be ready for some confusion and cliffhanging while you read. This took some getting used to for me, but I ended up loving it within the first 100 pages. And let me just say: I really loved how this format threw out plot twists. SO GOOD. I had conflicted feelings about the Afflicted  people who suffered a biochemical attack and developed into terrifying, zombielike shells of themselves. Murderous, smart, and capable of hunting in packs, the Afflicted serve as a HUGE horrortension builder. I understand that theyre an example of how ruthless and evil the corporation, BeiTech, truly is. I also think they were an interesting example of the dangerous wartactics employed by the intergalactic world Kady and Ezra inhabit. So knowing all that, I get why their presence is necessary for the story. I guess for me they felt a little clunky since theres so much action already. I think even without the Afflicted, Illuminae would be a crazy edgeofyourseat read. That said, I get why theyre included, and they certainly didnt make me enjoy the book any less. TLDR; This was literally me during most of the book except for when I was cryinggroaninginternally screaming: I think Illuminae has everything: action, adventure, heartbreak, blinding plot twists, and characters you can cheer for from beginning to end. Please give this novel a try. Its interesting, its different, and its honestly my favorite book of 2015. And I mean, who doesnt like an actionpacked story set in space? I cant wait for the next book in this series! 2016 is going to be an awesome year for sequels.
OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!! I cant possibly think of ONE reason of why it took me SO FREAKING LONG to read this series. What the hell was I thinking? If you have someone in your life that has recommended the Throne of Glass series, YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM. If not, here I am, telling you to READ IT NOW. You wont regret it, trust me. Note: this is the fourth book of the series, so if you havent read the previous books, maybe you should skip this one out. Ill do my best to keep this review spoiler free, but it might give some stuff away from the first 3 books. The queen has returned. Everyone Celaena Sardothien loves has been taken from her. But shes at last returned to the empirefor vengeance, to rescue her onceglorious kingdom, and to confront the shadows of her past... She has embraced her identity as Aelin Galathynius, Queen of Terrasen. But before she can reclaim her throne, she must fight. She will fight for her cousin, a warrior prepared to die for her. She will fight for her friend, a young man trapped in an unspeakable prison. And she will fight for her people, enslaved to a brutal king and awaiting their lost queens triumphant return. The fourth volume in the New York Times bestselling series continues Celaenas epic journey and builds to a passionate, agonizing crescendo that might just shatter her world. My god, this book was AMAZING. Sarah J. Mass managed to make me love these characters even more than I thought was possible. In this book we have our main girl back in town, only shes no longer Celaena Sardothien. Shes an assasin, a warrior, a queen. Shes fire, shes strength, and now shes come back to take back whats hers, what was taken away from her ten years ago. Shes come back to fight those who wronged her, her family and her people. With the help of her friends and allies, she must face the face of evil. Although, that face might not be what she expected. We have blood everywhere, deceitful bastards, vengeful warriors and consuming darkness. We also have passionate love, eternal hope and a lot more blood. All these things made the story such an interesting one. By now, Ive gotten the chance to know Aelin so much more. After you understand her story, you get to see that yes, in fact, there was something off with her in the first two books, like something was missing. She keeps being the sassy badass weve known, but in this book, shes no longer that selfish child we saw before. God. The girl in this book is no longer a girl, shes a strong woman who will fight with nails and teeth and fire. No holding back. To whatever end. Shes become one of those characters you end up admiring, because you know that everything she does, its done for a reason. There are no coincidences here. She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph. Now. I mentioned Rowan on my review of Heir of Fire, but do you guys really know how deep my love goes for him? I mean, if youve read the books, you probably do, because seriously... How could you not fall deeply, madly in love with him? The fierceness of his feelings and the depth of his knowledge. I just cant talk about him without sighing. I missed Rowan. I missed his sincerity, his strength. The loyalty hes shown to his queen is just beyond what I expected. Theres so much respect and so much love and so much of everything. Hes part of the reason our queen has grown so much and you cant not love him for that. I spent centuries wandering the world, from empires to kingdoms to wastelands, never settling, never stoppingnot for one moment. I was always looking toward the horizon, always wondering what waited across the next ocean, over the next mountain. But I think ... I think that whole time, all those centuries, I was just looking for you. Then theres Dorian. Jesus Christ. I want to hold him and hug him and never let him go. Ive always loved Dorian. I see the goodness in him and his heart. Hes the king Adarlan needs. Hes incorruptible. Hes loyal. Hes dedicated. But beyond all that, hes pure, raw kindness. And hes had to see evil first hand and my heart just ached for him. But I love this character so, so much. He represents weakness and strength, evil and good, despair and hope and somehow, he manages to inspire good. They joined hands. So the world ended. And the next one began. Then we have Aedion and Lyssandra. These two are incredible. Aedion with his need to protect his queen, his sassiness, and his bravery. I love everything about him. The love he has for Aelin is something beyond this world, and I admire everything hes willing to do to get her home, to give her what was taken away from her, even though he knows she can get it herself. He knows what Aelin is capable of and I understand his need to protect her. Then theres Lyssandra. She was such a nice surprise. I wasnt expecting to find in her a loyal friend. We do have a couple of new characters and returning characters and with them, we get new points of view. In the previous book I felt them a bit off and I dare call them a bit boring because I was so invested in the main characters, but now... Everything has changed. These new characters have been growing and giving something new to the story, something that I wasnt aware was missing until I finished the book, now I find myself wondering about them and whats going to happen to them. This book was perfectly written. Ill say it again, I dont know why it took me this long to read this series. Im 100 in love with the characters and their stories. Each give something completely unique to the story and make it all the more interesting. As if that was even possible. I am incredibly excited to read the next book.
Our Dragon doesnt eat the girls he takes, no matter what stories they tell outside our valley. We hear them sometimes, from travelers passing through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice, and he were a real dragon. Of course thats not true: he may be a wizard and immortal, but hes still a man, and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to eat one of us every ten years. This book has spellbound me. Naomi Novik has created a beautiful story, and it ensnared me like The Woods she writes of. But first... I want to start off by stating that I really enjoyed this book. I found it incredibly fun, and incredibly endearing. Overall it was just a really charming fairytale, and it hooked me. That doesnt mean Im blind to its faults, and it does have faults. I went in having read two kinds of reviews with little inbetween. One review being a glowing five star, singing Uprooted all the praises they could think to bestow upon it one review I read even called it a masterpiece. The second kind was a one star review taking about how this was one of the worst novels they had ever read, and how they wished they hadnt wasted their time reading it. I read one angry rant that was quite startling in is clear visceral hatred. So naturally when I began reading I was hesitant as to what I would find and ultimately I think Im one of the rarer people who falls inbetween of the two extreme viewpoints. There was a song in this forest, too, but it was a savage song, whispering of madness and tearing and rage. Firstly you have to remember jumping in that while this book is a fantasy, it is first and foremost a fairytale. The characters arent the very well developed, the magic system is pretty shallow compared to the kinds of magic I read in most fantasies, and the plot is fast I mean really fast I got a bit of whiplash with how quickly things progressed. Im not saying all fairytales are like this, especially nowadays with the more in depth retellings, but in my mind this was an old style fairytale. I found the characters and the magic as thin as they were incredibly fun, so while I could intellectually see the flaws and why some people would be annoyed, I didnt care because I was having to good a time. The unraveled threads of my magic were gradually coiling back into my skin. The magic system, despite lacking in detail, was enchanting HA! See what I did there? Only funny to me? Okay, sorry, moving on..., and the dichotomy between the two different ways of wielding magic, and how it came together was a real payoff, and made up for a lot. Not to mention Noviks beautiful description of characters weaving their spells. Still I found Agnieszka came into her abilities much to rapidly for my taste, and more explanation would have been nice. The use of Jaga Baba Yaga, or the shadow of her really, was well done though I longed for her to appear, and not just lurk between the pages. Though in the end that was probably a more effective way of telling the story, and my wanting is a symptom of the skillful use of this device. He was a thing of books and alembics to me, library and laboratory. Despite having borderline onedimensional characters I found the dimensions they did posses enjoyable. Agnieszka and the Dragons interactions were super fun Im a sucker for love hate relationships, and the banter between the two was great. Some may not like the relationship between the two, but I felt it developed nicely, and surprisingly steadily, considering how hyper fast everything else in the novel moved along. The captorcaptee aspect was dealt with smoothly, so there was not any kind of ick factor in regards to the progression of their relationship. I didnt care a whit about Kasia though. Usually Im all for strong female friendships, but I felt no attachment to Agnieszka and Kasias friendship whatsoever. There isnt much of a basis for the friendship the reader is just kind of told theyre best friends, but the reasons for it are simply not shown. And more to the point, I found Kasia boring and wanted her out of the way. Characters who are written to be perfect are probably my biggest pet peeve, and while Kasia did not send me into a rage as some other characters have made me before, I couldnt make myself like her either. I was just ambivalent towards her longing for her to get out of the way, or at least have the decency to develop a few flaws if she was so determined to stick around. Agnieszka to has a bit of the same problem as Kasia. Its not that Agnieszka is perfect its that she has a serious case of being the special one. It didnt become annoying until abut halfway through the novel when I just felt she had become far to special, far to different, to be believable, and it quite honestly took some of the enjoyment away from me. I think my breaking point was when Agnieszka was being tested by the other witches and wizards and showed off just how truly different as special she was, and while it took her only a few months to become a qualified witch, it took most others seven years. Then I nearly laughed out loud when she was going to receive her name, but she was so different and unique, and she didnt get one. I just could not help but roll my eyes at that. There is such a thing as being too exceptional. And no, her clumsiness does not make up for it in the least. In fact I found it unpleasantly reminiscent of Bella Swan. I wanted to rub handprints through his dust. The fast paced plot was jarring to me at times. I would have appreciated more quiet moments, more introspection but perhaps that is just me trying to make the novel into something it was never meant to be. The concept of The Woods was a great one, and did not just add to the atmosphere of the fairytale, but was a unique antagonist, that could have been cheesy if written poorly, but in this case felt like an honest threat. All in all I would highly recommend this book, despite its faults. Its a lighthearted, fairytale romp but if you go in expecting Catherynne M. Valente you are going to be disappointed. Think more Howls Moving Castle, which I believe is a fairly apt comparison, though in truth I would have to say Howls Moving Castle is the superior of the two. But really, despite the criticisms I gave, I truly enjoyed Uprooted. I was completely enamored, and liked it enough to go out and buy a hard copy despite the fact that I bought it initially as an eBook. I also created a Pinterest mood board for Uprooted because I was so taken by the story. EDIT: I originally rated this 3 stars and only recently after a little less then a year bumped it up to four stars, though I have not reread it. I have the tendency to nitpick a novel as I gain more distance from it, and will inevitably find flaws in it I had not noticed upon reading it for the first time. The opposite seems to have occurred with Uprooted. While I still stand by my criticisms, I really do look on this book fondly, and highly enjoyed it. Ive softened to it as time goes by, and since I still have not quite gotten it out of my head I decided to make my review four stars.
Should have been five stars, but one very SIGNIFICANT event knocked off an entire star. One single event. grumbles Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog The Young Elites by Marie Lu Book One of The Young Elites series Publisher: Putnam Juvenile Publisher: October 7, 2014 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC sent by the publisher Summary from Goodreads: I am tired of being used, hurt, and cast aside. Adelina Amouteru is a survivor of the blood fever. A decade ago, the deadly illness swept through her nation. Most of the infected perished, while many of the children who survived were left with strange markings. Adelinas black hair turned silver, her lashes went pale, and now she has only a jagged scar where her left eye once was. Her cruel father believes she is a malfetto, an abomination, ruining their familys good name and standing in the way of their fortune. But some of the fevers survivors are rumored to possess more than just scarsthey are believed to have mysterious and powerful gifts, and though their identities remain secret, they have come to be called the Young Elites. Teren Santoro works for the king. As Leader of the Inquisition Axis, it is his job to seek out the Young Elites, to destroy them before they destroy the nation. He believes the Young Elites to be dangerous and vengeful, but its Teren who may possess the darkest secret of all. Enzo Valenciano is a member of the Dagger Society. This secret sect of Young Elites seeks out others like them before the Inquisition Axis can. But when the Daggers find Adelina, they discover someone with powers like theyve never seen. Adelina wants to believe Enzo is on her side, and that Teren is the true enemy. But the lives of these three will collide in unexpected ways, as each fights a very different and personal battle. But of one thing they are all certain: Adelina has abilities that shouldnt belong in this world. A vengeful blackness in her heart. And a desire to destroy all who dare to cross her. It is my turn to use. My turn to hurt. What I Liked: Wooaahhh. Marie Lu should write fantasy. I mean, her dystopia series, the Legend trilogy, was excellent, but this FANTASY NOVEL. I am seriously impressed. Not that you shouldnt be impressed anyway, because its Marie Lu, and the woman a is really talented writer to begin with. Adelina murdered someone, and she will be burned on the stake for this. She is one of the malfetto, a survivor of the blood fever, with some sort of marking and strange abilities. Her marking is the scar where her left eye should be  the doctor cut her eye out to save her from the fever. Her abilities  she never found out, until she killed someone. Rescued by the Dagger Society, led by Enzo Valeciano, Adelina must decide if she wants to support this rebellion group, or help the Inquisitor, who has her younger sister. The synopsis is super creepy, and super spot on. It is my turn to use. My turn to hurt. That line is PERFECT. It totally fits this book to the T. Adelina is used and hurt. Her own father treats her like less than nothing, because she is a malfetto, imperfect, scarred. He physically hurts her, like breaking her finger, but he also mentally and emotionally hurts her. When Adelina is rescued by Enzo and the Dagger Society other malfetto with abilities, she does everything she can to learn as much as possible. And the others in the Dagger Society know this. Raffaele, a beautiful male courtesan, has the ability to sense malfetto energy, and he knows that she is powerful. He urges Enzo the Dagger leader to kill Adelina, because he knows that her power is dark and bitter. Raffaele and Adelina become friends, but Raffaele is truly afraid of Adelina. Of course Enzo doesnt kill Adelina. But perhaps he should have... This book has a seriously dark tone to it. Adelina has a lot of hatred and darkness in her past  as do all of the Young Elites malfetto with abilities, but she also has raw power and ambition. Enzo wants her to fight with the Dagger Society because she would be a huge asset. If she can hone her abilities. She can create illusions. I like Adelina. She is twisted and selfless and dark and complex  there is a light and dark side to her, which sounds cliche, but it isnt. The character development of Adelina is excellent. Enzo is already a static character, so I dont see too much character development in him, but I definitely liked him. He reminded me of Rowan in Heir of Fire by Sarah J. Maas. Enzo has a hard, steely quality to him, with no room for arguments or contradictions. The supporting characters, like Raffaele and Violetta, the Spider, the Windwalker... I love the set of characters that Lu has created. She is a master at character construction and development. There is romance in this novel, to an extent. Its not dominant or overwhelming, and honestly, its quite strange, but its there. So, for those of you that cant read a YA novel without romance, relax, theres romance in this book. For those of you who like it when the romance isnt the central part of the plot like me, thats basically how this romance goes. Lus worldbuilding is awesomeeee. I felt like I was living in Dalia, experiencing what Adelina was seeing or thinking or doing, etc. Lu is really good at describing a situation without boring readers, or setting up the scene without providing an infodump. I love the imagery, especially! The Italian influence is awesome. The names, setting, masks, GONDOLAS... love the Italian influence. This book is written in several pointsofview. Adelinas is in first person. Terens I did not mention him on purpose, Raffaeles, and Enzos are in third person. This is a neat way to switch up things. It keeps you on your toes, so you must follow which characters perspective it is. To round it all off... the ending was INSANE. Upon finishing the novel, I mentioned on Goodreads that I knocked a star off for one specific aspect of the ending. Trust me, youll know what I mean. Im not happy with this one aspect, but I suppose its an excellent hook so that readers will keep reading. The cliffhangers... they kill me! What I Did Not Like: Like I said before, one specific aspect of the ending knocked this book down to four stars. It was well on its way to five stars until that ONE BIT. But its an excellent hook. I loved this book and was already extremely excited to read the second book anyway, but even if I had hated this book... I would have wanted to know what happens next. I wonder how Lu will salvage this situation... Would I Recommend It: Yes! Totally! Fantasy fan or not, youll want to catch this one. Marie Lu is an excellent writer, and her books totally live up to the hype. She has a penchant for horribly twisted endings though, so watch out. Rating: 4.5 stars  rounded down to 4 stars. I cannot wait to read book two! I want to see more from the romance hehe, and more from the big picture, the overarching series plot. Heres hoping itll be even more epic than book one!
TaNehisi Coates gives his readers a gift of teaching them his world, through writing to his son. He is angry because he must be and he is kind even though he doesnt have to be. He shows us how he views the struggle of his world and invites us to our own. So much love and work went into the writing, and it doesnt flinch from the complexity of things, revealing how themes and truths come through the complex parts of the world. The narrative takes him through his thinking and brings us along, and we are privileged to go on the journey. I waited so long to read this I had to read it in a day to get it back to the library, and really I dont feel like I can write that well about it, but I do want to get some of the quotes down that I marked for later  the book itself works so well as one piece that I kind of hate to pick apart quotes, and some of these are just reminders to me of places where I wanted to remember a larger argument, so thats my disclaimer: Americans believe in the reality of race as a defined, indubitable feature of the natural world. ... But race is the child of racism, not the father. And the process of naming the people has never been a matter of genealogy and physiognomy so much as one of hierarchy. 7 The greatest reward of this constant interrogation, of confrontation with the brutality of my country, is that it has freed me from ghosts and girded me against the sheer terror of disembodiment. 12 It does not matter that the intentions of individual educators were noble. Forget about intentions. What any institution, or its agents, intend for you is secondary. Our world is physical. ... Very few Americans will directly proclaim that they are in favor of black people being left to the streets. But a very large number of Americans will do all they can to preserve the Dream. No one directly proclaimed that schools were designed to sanctify failure and destruction. But a great number of educators spoke of personal responsibility in a country authored and sustained by a criminal irresponsibility. The point of this language of intention and personal responsibility is broad exoneration. Mistakes were made. Bodes were broken. People were enslaved. We meant well. We tried our best. Good intention is a hall pass through history, a sleeping pill that ensures the Dream. 33 An unceasing interrogation of the stories told to us by the schools now felt essential. It felt wrong not to ask why, and then to ask it again. ... I dont know that I have ever found any satisfactory answers of my own. But every time I ask it, the question is refined. That is the best of what the old heads meant when they spoke of being politically conscious as much a series of actions as a state of being, a constant questioning, questioning as ritual, questioning as exploration rather than the search for certainty. 34 I went into this investigation imagining history to be a unified narrative, free of debate, which, once uncovered, would imply verify everything I had always suspected. ... The trouble came almost immediately. I did not find a coherent tradition marching lockstep but instead faction, and factions within factions. ... I was left with a brawl of ancestors, a herd of dissenters, sometimes marching together but just as often marching away from each other. 4748 I was made for the library, not the classroom. The classroom was a jail of other peoples interests. The library was open, unending, free. 48 The Dream thrives on generalization, on limiting the number of possible questions, on privileging immediate answers. ... And it became clear that this was not just for the dreams concocted by Americans to justify themselves but also for the dreams that I had conjured to replace them. I had thought that I must mirror the outside world, create a carbon copy of white claims to civilization. It was beginning to occur to me to question the logic of the claim itself. 50 It began to strike me that the point of my education was a kind of discomfort, was the process that would not award me my own especial Dream but would break all the dreams, all the comforting myths of Africa, of America, and everywhere, and would leave me only with humanity in all its terribleness. 52 My great error was not that I had accepted someone elses dream but that I had accepted the fact of dreams, the need for escape, and the invention of racecraft. And still and all I knew that we were something, that we were a tribeon one hand, invented, and on the other, no less real. 56 Slavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. 69 The problem with the police is not that they are fascist pigs but that our country is ruled by majoritarian pigs. 79 All my life Id heard people tell their black boys and black girls to be twice as good, which is to say accept half as much. These words would be spoken with a veneer of religious nobility, as though they evidenced some unspoken quality, some undetected courage, when in fact all they evidenced was the gun to our head and the hand in our pocket. This is how we lose our softness. This is how they steal our right to smile. 9091 The killing fields of Chicago, of Baltimore, of Detroit, were created by the policy of Dreamers, but their weight, their shame, rests solely upon those who are dying in them. There is a great deception in this. To yell blackonblack crime is to shoot a man and then shame him for bleeding. 111 ...today, with a sprawling prison system, which has turned the warehousing of black bodies into a jobs program for Dreamers and a lucrative investment for Dreamers; today, when 8 percent of the worlds prisoners are black men, our bodies have refinanced the Dream of being white. Black life is cheap, but in America black bodies are a natural resource of incomparable value. 131132 This power, this black power, originates in a view of the American galaxy taken from a dark and essential planet. black power is the dungeonside view of Monticellowhich is to say, the view taken in struggle. And black power births a kind of understanding that illuminates all the galaxies in their truest colors. ... We have made something down here. We have taken the onedrop rules of Dreamers and flipped them. They made us into a race. We made ourselves into a people. 149
If I were to paint you, I would use every color. You know youre going to experience a myriad of emotions just by opening an Amy Harmon book, having personally welcomed many a sunrise curled up in bed sobbing like a baby while not getting a wink of sleep, simply unable to put her beautiful words down. But nothing could have prepared me for the sheer exquisiteness of this story, and for the marvellous characters Ms Harmon has once again gifted us with. Every part of this book surprised me, thrilled me, made my heart burst at the seams, and the biggest gift Im going to give you, my fellow readers, is by not telling you what this story is really all about. This is the story of love with no end . . . though it took me a while to get there. We meet Georgia Shepherd at the tender age of seventeena simple girl from a small country town, a tomboy, a loving daughter. Georgias love of horses and her unique talent at taming them have always meant that her future would never be uncertain, but Georgias rather sheltered small town upbringing has also made her hungry to leave home for a while, seek the unknown and experience freedom for the first time in her life. Yet everything changes when a young man with an unusual life story moves into the house next door. ... when Moses came to Levan, he was like watercold, deep, unpredictable, and, like the pond up the canyon, dangerous, because you could never see what was beneath the surface. Moses Wright was born a crack baby, and found abandoned in a laundry basket when he was only a few hours old. Moses has always been different from other little boys of his age, his unusual looks only overshadowed by his peculiar behaviour, his unpredictable temperament and his determination not to let anyone get close to him. Constantly tossed from one relative to another, never wanted by any, repeatedly dismissed as a messed up kid who could not be fixed, his life never became easy. However, everything changes for Moses the day his greatgrandmother decides to take him in on a permanent basis, despite being advised against it by her entire family, her love for him making her confident she could pull him out of his selfimposed solitude. But Moses is not an ordinary young man. He holds a secret that has shaped his entire existence, every human contact, everything he sees around him, and that very secret has made him afraid of loving anyone in his life. His incredible but highly unusual art is a visual representation of everything he keeps to himself, his only escape from the images he cannot hide from. If you dont love, then nobody gets hurt. Its easy to leave. Its easy to lose. Its easy to let go. The last thing Moses expects to find in life is someone like Georgia Shepherd. She is open, unpretentious and her every failed attempt at making Moses warm up to her and let her be his friend only seem to make her even more determined to sneak through the cracks of Moses brooding disposition. Georgia is the kind of girl who loves freely, generously, and her pride never gets in the way of her honesty, regardless of how many times he rejects her or mistreats her with harsh words. She speaks without thinking, says everything and anything that is on her mind, gives her heart unreservedly, and eventually, a bit of Georgias light manages to shine through the dark cracks that Moses so desperately tries to hide. She was a small town girl with a simple way of speaking and thinking, a frank way of being that turned me on and turned me off at the same time. I wanted to run from her. But at the same time, I spent all my time thinking about her. As their budding romance progresses very slowly, and Georgia grows more and more attached to Moses, heartshattering loss strikes this young mans life again, and his future suddenly changes forever. When faced with returning to a place that only holds sorrow for him or taking off to never return to that place again, Moses decides to flee, leaving behind a heartbroken girl whose only sin was loving him without restraint. Im a very ordinary girl, Moses. I know that I am. And I always will be. I cant paint. I dont know who Vermeer is, or Manet for that matter. But if you think ordinary can be beautiful, that gives me hope. And maybe sometime youll think about me when you need an escape from the hurt in your head. Seven years later, their paths suddenly cross again, but neither of them are the same as they once were. Life has changed them both deeply, taken away their innocence and altered their perception of what they once shared. However, some loves never fade, some loves survive all hurt, and some loves never stop reminding you of everything you should be grateful for. Georgias eyes, Georgias hair, Georgias mouth, Georgias love, Georgias long, long legs. As always, there is a subtle but very powerful message woven into every word, every single heartwarming scene. By letting us hear both the main characters voices, we are given the opportunity to bond with them equally, to understand them, empathise with them, share their hopes. Moses secret is a crucial part of the story itself, an angle I never expected to find or adore so much, and because of the way it astonished me, I wish for you to uncover it on your own too. This is a book about gratitude, about never forgetting that there is always something to be thankful for in life, even in the grimmest of moments, and that it is never too late to seize happiness and never let go of it again. Its a story that does not shield us in any way from soulcrushing heartbreak, a few scenes being so intensely distressing that I could not breathe from the sheer heaviness of them, but the beauty of the moments of joy we are given throughout this book is what we walk away with, smiling through our tears and babbling our own five greats to ourselves. There are no words that would ever do justice to a story like this one. Ms Harmon has once again given us an inspiring tale to cherish forever, a story written so elegantly, at times even poetically, that breathes itself into our hearts and, hopefully, even leaves a small part of itself behind. An absolute delight to read, as always. If you would just let me in, if you would just love me back, we could have a beautiful life. See this review on my blog!  Follow me on Facebook!

 Versions Owned: ARC, Paperback, Hardcover, UK PB purple, The Gathering Dark UK title  4.5 stars Initial Thoughts 82612:I really loved Shadow and Bone! The concept was interesting and uniquely put together in a way that had me racing through the book to see how it all came together. I really enjoyed the characters and I loved the twists that Leigh Bardugo involved in the plot. Overall a really enjoyable read! Full review originally posted on The Book Addicts Guide 9512: Once again I find myself singing the praises of high fantasy! Id seen tons of praise for this book pretty much everywhere and after seeing Leigh Bardugo at Andersons Bookshop first on the Fierce Reads tour in June and again at Andersons on August 30th although I actually finished the book before then!, just seeing her personality and hearing her talk about the book and how she came up with it really drove me to get into the story. I absolutely loved the development of the Grisha and the story behind their history and abilities. It seemed utterly magical but as we learn more about the talents, theres a little bit of practicality mixed in as well. It was really interesting to learn about and I found it quite unique. Another thing I really enjoyed is that the romance aspect isnt overdone. We first learn that Alina has developed a crush on Mal in the very beginning of the book, so thats something we already know, but since Mal is also her best friend and pretty much only friend, that also makes him so much more to Alina. Hes incredibly important to her and its not just a lust factor. As for The Darkling..... well thats just a pure lust situation! So yes, I really loved where the story went and I loved how it all came together in the end! Leigh Bardugos writing was also extremely enjoyable and I loved the new elements that she brought to the story. Reread reactions 51214: Wow, this was so much fun to reread! I did so via audio so it was a new experience and so much fun to live through all over again. I feel like the second half was definitely the stronger half with more action, more romance, and more suspense. Obviously I enjoyed both, but things really pick up towards the end and just really get exciting! So happy I did a reread and I honestly cant wait to start Siege and Storm all over again too! This book still proves that this series is one of my favorites and just brought up all those FEELINGS all over again. ReRead Review originally posted HERE on The Book Addicts Guide 61814: This was quite the interesting reread for me... I think this was the first reread in which I had two totally different expectations going into it: When I first picked up Shadow and Bone almost two years ago !!!, I was not a fantasy reader. I think I had read Graceling first and that was about it, so I wasnt expecting much in the way of a new fantasy book and it turned out that I loved it! I was really scared going into the reread this time because I had since fallen in love with this series and was afraid that the reread just wouldnt be the same. Honestly, I did read the book entirely differently. Well, in two ways  I bought the audiobook from Audible because Ive started to really enjoy doing my rereads via audiobook and also because I been obsessing over the series for two years now and all of the THINGS that I know, Im able to pick up on so much more with a reread. I must say, rereading SHADOW AND BONE really proved to me how amazing SIEGE AND STORM was. As someone who wasnt a fantasy reader before, I very much appreciated the whole revelation of having powers, learning how to use them in that almost boarding schooltype setting, and the romances involved but reading all of these things a second time and especially after reading SIEGE AND STORM came across totally differently. Honestly, TOTALLY. For one, I already knew Alina had powers and exactly what they entailed, so I wasnt as interested in the figuring out process so much as paying attention to the other details that I may have glossed over in my first read. The whole learning process actually wasnt as appealing to me the second time around, I think because I really already knew how it happened so I was ready to dive into more character development of secondary characters which didnt happen as much in the first book as it does in the second. SHADOW AND BONE is very much about Alina and about Mal and about their ties to the Grisha so my impatience didnt exactly pay off haha. But of course, it was still enjoyable to go through that experience again! I read the romance aspect of this book entirely differently the second time around. During my first read, I did not get what was the big deal about Mal. I liked him and I loved his friendship with Alina but I didnt fall for him or the Darkling, really, but thats another story the way other readers did. During my reread. YEAH. MAL. IM THERE. I really got to know him better in SIEGE AND STORM so that made my connection in this reread stronger but WHOO BOY, that best friend romance thing going on there.... fans self How was I not more into this during my first read!? I dont understand. Because best friends falling for each other is a trope that I luuuurve and I was totally on board with it during my reread. I also felt less lovetriangley about the Darkling because knowing what I know now, it seemed more like a power play than a romance and I had it in my head that way more happened than it actually did in the book. Since I already knew about the worldbuilding side of the book, I did pay more attention to the romance this time around which hadnt really seemed to play a big part for me during my original read. Speaking of world building, that was something I really enjoyed even more. The more I read about this world, the more I fall in love with it. Its always a little difficult to get a grasp on a new world with unique and foreign names so now that I know a little more about the Grishaverse, I really got a hold on what happens where and exactly whats involved. As far as plotting and characters go, obviously now I know their connections, but even then I was formulating new theories about the Darkling and why we dont know his name yet and what if its related to or connected to characters weve already met and dont know it?! I think I enjoyed my original read a little bit more than the reread but I am even MORE anxious to reread SIEGE AND STORM and Im still salivating over RUIN AND RISING and dreaming about how its SO CLOSE. Im still in love with this world and this series and it will be bittersweet to end in June but I still cant wait!
Augustus drives worse than the Taiwan taxi drivers who pump the gas pedal like a pipe organ and speed through switchbacktype alleys that leave my husband and me so carsick I have resorted to stashing airline puke bags in my purse. Hazel Grace Lancaster also gets tossed to and fro while driving around town with Augustus who has no feeling in his prosthetic leg, I flew against the seat belt of his Toyota SUV each time he braked, and my necked snapped backward each time he hit the gas. Augustus explains he failed taking his drivers test three times at which Hazel replies, You dont say. Hazels sarcastic humor and wit, along with a great supporting cast of characters, make this love story surprisingly funny given that Hazel has terminal cancer. Hazels thyroid cancer from three years ago has spread to her lungs and is slowly killing her. She carries around an oxygen tank that she calls, Philip, and describes her support group with a mixture of humor, disgust, crudeness, and philosophy in this great teenagy runon sentence: So heres how it went in Gods heart: The six or seven or ten of us walkedwheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable like story  how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didnt die and now here he is, a fullgrown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way toward a masters degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life. AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY! One of many clever references, the sword of Damocles is in a Greek tale about a powerful leader who is in constant fear; thus showing the constant fear Patrick and others at the group meeting face daily whether they are cancerfree or not. Hazel implies that cancer is like having a sword over your head that is being held in place by a horses hair. When Hazel meets Augustus at the support group, a former basketball player who has lost a leg to osteosarcoma, he lends her his favorite scifi book, The Price of Dawn, a novelization of his favorite video game. She, in turn, lends him her bestloved book, An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten, about a young girl with cancer. Van Houten ends his novel in the middle of a sentence and Hazel is obsessed with finding out what happens to the characters, writing to the author over ten years, begging him  to no avail  for answers. After reading An Imperial Affliction, Augustus decides to use his wish from The Genie Foundation, a charity that grants requests of very ill children, to send himself and Hazel to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten in a lifechanging trip. I thought the weaving of references to existentialism was not only intriguing but added depth, irony, and emotion to the story. In a nutshell, existentialism is a philosophy that claims a person defines himself or herself through conscious decisions in a hostile or indifferent environment versus a person being defined by arbitrary or preconceived stereotypes. Or more simply, it is a conscious decision to give value or meaning to life. In this story, cancer, and the good and bad reaction of people without cancer, is the hostile environment and those who have cancer must consciously define how they want to live and approach each day. Lets face it, most young readers are not going to know about existentialism and while Augustus phrase existentially fraught free throws might go over the head of many, readers will get the gist that his existential moment happened one day when he was questioning the meaningfulness of playing basketball. It also happened to be the last day of his dual leggedness. One of Hazels burning questions is the fate of the hamster, Sisyphus. In Greek myth, Sisyphus is condemned to the meaningless labor of repeatedly pushing a boulder up a mountain and watching it roll down. Like a hamster on a wheel that goes nowhere, or Sisyphus repeating the same task over and over, Hazels effort to fight cancer is repetitive and meaningless. Sisyphus is also referred to by the famous existential writer, Albert Camus in his novel, The Myth of Sisyphus. Camus introduces absurdism, a branch of existentialism, that asserts people live in a meaningless, chaotic world. Cancer is absurd and there is no rhyme or reason as to who it strikes or why some survive and others dont. The video game played by Hazel, Augustus, and Isaac emphasize abundant meaningless kills of virtual characters and how Augustus always sacrifices himself to save another in the game versus killing and winning the game. Not only does this fit with existentialism and Augustus trying to shape meaning into his life, but is symbolic of cancer killing him and his sacrifice of his wish to save Hazel and help her give meaning to her cancerriddled life by talking to Van Houten. Hazel also wants her parents to have meaning in their life which revolves around her cancer as well. The portrayal of the loving, supportive parents trying to deal with a daughter who is dying is poignant, but not overly melodramatic. Hazel is still scolded when she shows a bratty attitude or gets annoyed at a hovering mother. This novel has so many references, themes, and metaphors I need to cut myself off  this review is starting to sound like an English paper  but bear with me on another theme. Hazel and Augustus go to Amsterdam and tour the Anne Frank house. The parallels of the injustice and randomness of death occurring to Anne Frank is similar to how cancer strikes. Anne Frank didnt deserve to live in an attic and die, nor does Hazel or any of the other support group member with cancer. It appears meaningless and harsh, but the characters decide to make each day count in spite of the chaos of this disease. They take risks by becoming friends, falling in love, or getting answers from an author who wrote a compelling book. In the process they grow and change and they are so likable we cant help but root for them all the way. The writing is rich, characters strong, and the topic surrounding cancer emotionallycharged and full of tension. I did guess a major plot point in the first chapter, but thats mainly because the story follows the classic romance formula of girl meets boy; girl and boy fall in love; some obstacle gets in the way of their love; girl and boy get back together. Wellwritten romances do this so it isnt a bad thing. And even though it scooped a little of the surprise for me, there are other excellent plot twists, along with the oodles of references and metaphors that kept me engaged in the story. The swearing and sex scene not graphic make this a middle school book. Enjoy the ride.
This life is not always what we think it will be. You are an ember in the ashes, Elias Veturius. You will spark and burn, ravage and destroy. You cannot change it. You cannot stop it. THIS BOOK WAS SO MUCH FUN! Okay, maybe fun isnt the best word to describe it. Its more like the sadistic kind of fun. The kind of fun thats also kind of scary. This book had my heart racing. It gave me a Game of Thrones feel because I felt like anyone could die at any minute. No one is safe in this book. The Empire is brutal and merciless. It was all so exhilarating and so very fun, I enjoyed every moment while reading it. I loved how dark the story was, sometimes it got so dark I was scared to keep reading. Its so horrible how the Martials treat the slaves, like theyre less than them. Like theyre not even human. It horrifies me to no end because at one point out world had slaves too. I still cant even begin to imagine what slavery was like. What being a slave was like. Everything Laia, Izzi, and Cook go through... Its absolutely horrifying and scary to think that in some ways are we any better than the Martials? The Empire? The Commandant? Raping, killing, abusing, slavery. Do we take, take, take until theres nothing left to give? The Commandant scares the shit out of me. Shes such a ruthless and complex character. I also thinks shes a bit crazy but I loved absolutely every minute reading about her. I want to learn more about her childhood and what happened between her and Eliass father. Marcus seems to be a little insane as well. Im actually really nervous about him and what his character will become in future books. Im pretty sure hes a psychopath to be honest. Laia shes definitely not your typical badass female character, but I loved her so much! I loved her determination to beat her fears. I loved how she expressed fear and bravery at the same time. I loved her love for her brother. I love her character development and how she finds her own strength. Izzy is super badass in her own little way, I love love loved her. Cook also had her shining moments. Im not exactly sure how I feel about her, but I know I want to know more about her character. Shes so mysterious! Elias is also very complex as well, all of the characters had so much depth! I liked how he was constantly trying to escape his destiny. How he saw his destiny in the first trial and swore to break it. It really made me respect his character. I know destiny is probably going to play a huge part in the books. Ive personally never believed in destiny. I think the future is constantly changing and you couldnt possibly know the EXACT outcome of everything. Maybe thats why I was so skeptical about the Augurs. I didnt really know what I thought about them. I know with their power comes a great burden and responsibility, but I feel like because they knew the outcome they should have tried their best to fix it. Like sometimes they helped and sometimes they didnt? And the Trials, oh my God the trials. The third trial was absolutely horrifying to read about. I had to close the book just to breathe. I was sobbing. Sobbing by the end of it. I just couldnt understand. Perhaps Im asking too much. I am not an Augur though and I know, what they do is beyond my comprehension. But even so, I still dont think I can ever forgive it. I dont know the outcome, maybe itll all turn out okay. I hope so. I do love their complexity and I really hope to learn more about them, I really wish I could tell what they were thinking! Back to Elias, his strength, his bravery, and his need for freedom really made me like his character. However, I was getting a ton of mixed signals from him! Him and Helene were honestly super confusing. I couldnt tell is he was just thinking with his dick or with genuine feelings. Sometimes Helene could get on my nerves, but I understand where shes coming from. I loved their friendship and I really hope they can overcome all of the problems I know they will face in future books. Keenan, meh, theres a part of me that doesnt trust him, which is probably because the entire Resistance group seemed shady to me from the very beginning. IM SO GLAD THERES A SEQUEL! An Ember in the Ashes needed a sequel. Theres so much of the world we have yet to explore. I want to learn more about the tribes and the history of the Scholars before the Martials came and screwed up their lives. Theres still so much more I want to learn about all the characters, so many things left for our protagonists to do! The characters were all so complex and full of life. I have so much I want to learn about them. I wish I could get inside their heads! The fact that there was never a plan for a sequel makes me so upset and extremely confused especially since that ending was not an ending at all! I NEEDED MORE. I dont understand how anyone who likes the book wouldnt want more! Thankfully though, we are getting a sequel. Im so excited for this ride. I know its going to be amazing! You are full, Laia. Full of life and dark and strength and spirit. You are in our dreams. You will burn, for you are an ember in the ashes. That is your destiny.  Dear Marcus, With hatred, Readers Everywhere
Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales Quick  Dirty: I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes YA Paranormal books with Angels. It is captivating, refreshing and fun. Opening Sentence: In the beginning, theres a boy standing in the trees. The Review: Clara Gardner is part angel, so is her mother and her brother. All part angels have a purpose that they are destined to fulfill and Clara is trying to figure out what hers is. She has started to get visions of a beautiful boy standing in a forest fire. What do her visions mean? Is she supposed to save the boy from the fire or is her purpose something else? Her family decides to relocate to Jackson Hole Wyoming where she believes her purpose will take place. While attending her new school Clara learns that there is more to being an angelblood than she thought. She meets her mystery boy from her visions, his name is Christian Prescott and he is the most beautiful, intimidating boy she has ever met. Clara has always been slightly awkward especially when it comes to the opposite sex. As she tries to figure out her purpose she meets many new friends and happens to fall in love along the way, but will love interfere with her purpose? I really loved Clara she is a fun young girl trying to find her place in life. She doesnt always make the best decisions throughout the book, but I think she tries to follow her heart and do the right thing. She is a very strong heroine even though at times she does what she is told instead of what she thinks is right. It is so fun to get to see her make new friends and fall in love for the first time. It made it easier to connect with her because I feel what she goes through was similar to my high school experience. Christian is our mysterious boy from the visions. He is the total IT boy in school, dating the prettiest girl, rich, and a big time jock. I liked Christian, but at times I thought that he was a little clueless. I think he is a nice guy, but I felt that it was really awkward most of the time between him and Clara. I hope to see their relationship grow more in the books to come, because at this time I just see him as a friend and not a love interest. WARNING: MAJOR GUSHING AHEAD!!! Tucker Avery is a blue eyed, blonde haired hottie. Not only is he a sexy cowboy but to top it off he is sweet, respectful and probably the best boyfriend ever!!! Honestly, I think that he is amazing and one of the most wonderful boys to ever be invented by an author!!! I know that this isnt the case for everyone but he is the perfect boy for me :! Gushing has stopped Tucker is that boy that everyone loves and respects. He is popular because he is a good person not because he is gorgeous or way good at sports. I love his and Claras relationship; it grows very slow and is so sweet. He is that guy you wish you could meet, almost to perfect to be true. As you can tell I am a big fan of Tucker and I hope that we get to see him a lot more in future books. Angela is another angel blood that Clara meets in Jackson and they become friends. I like Angela because she is mysterious and unlike Christian or Tucker she is more of a loner, which Clara seems to really like and relate to. Angela has a fun attitude and is very fun to read about. She takes more risks in her life and she seems to have some secrets that I am excited to learn more about in future books. She is a great friend to Clara and really tries to help her understand more about angelbloods. This book is such a fun, fast read. It takes a little to get into because there is a lot of background information that you have to go through, but it is so worth it. I have read so many angel books lately, but this one has a new fresh idea that just captivated me. The characters are fun, the plot is interesting and the ending is perfect. You arent left with a horrible cliffhanger, but you are left wanting more. I also love that this book is set in Jackson Wyoming. I happen to live only a few hours from there so I can really relate to all the places they visit in the book. I know that this will not be the case for the majority of people but I think that its a plus. I highly recommend this book to any fans of a good YA paranormal read, it will not disappoint. Cynthia Hand has created a wonderful enticing world that you will be left wondering about long after you finish the book. Notable Scene: But then I see him. Hes standing with his back to me near my locker. A surge of electricity zings through me as I recognize his shoulder, his hair, the shape if his head. In a flash Im in the vision, seeing him both in the black fleece jacket among the trees and for real, just down the hall simultaneously, like the vision is a thin veil laid on top of reality. I take a step toward him, my mouth opening to call his name. Then I remember that I dont know it. Like always, its as if he hears me anyway and starts to turn, and my heart skips a beat when I dont wake up but see his face now, his mouth curling up in a half smile as he jokes with the guy next to him. He glances up and his eyes meet mine. The hallway melts away. Its only him and me now, in the forest. The vision comes from behind him, the fire on the hillside roaring toward us, faster that it could ever possibly happen. I have to save him. I think. Thats when I faint.

From:  The Good Read Hard and Put Away Wet... Okay, I have been sitting her for 10 minutes and I still dont know what to write. I guess it is fitting since Divergent left me speechless. How do I write a review about a book like this? A book that revitalized me, a book that made me bite my nails for the first time in 3 years, a book that ripped out my heart and made me want more. My face actually hurts from the emotions I went through. Ive been caught smiling like an idiot, crying like a wuss, laughing to near hysteria, and waving my hands around from nervousness all while reading Divergent. I swear I found a new wrinkle between my eyes because I read this book so HARD. You ever do that? Reading a book hard is when you squeeze the cover from anxiety, rip the pages in your haste to see what happens next, and having to actually get up and stand while you finish a scene because of your nervous energy. Oh yeah, everyone in my household knows that if I am reading standing up then that book is the BOMB! Dont laugh because I used the word Bomb, I am totally bringing it back. Choose a Faction... Beatrice lives in a world where one of five virtues dictates the rest of a persons life. Once someone turns 16, they must decide which faction virtue they will live with the rest of their lives. You have a choice between Candor the honest, Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Amity the peaceful, and Erudite the intelligent, but once a faction is chosen, there is no turning back. That faction is your family, your only family. Beatrice loves her family, but she struggles with the choice of staying with them within a faction that no longer suits her or going with the faction that has fascinated and called to her most of her life. Finally gaining the courage, she leaves her family, joins a new faction, and renames herself Tris. But the hard part is not over yet. Tris must now survive the horrifying training process, cruel initiates, and political intrigue that might just bring destruction upon the faction system. Tris... I dont think this book would have been the same without Tris. It is her that takes us on a journey of selfdiscovery, the concept of virtues, and the trials one must go through to be accepted. Her struggles between being selfless, brave, and intelligent at the same time were captivating. Its hard for her to be just one, but she knows showing signs of too many virtues can get her killed. She was so meek and small in the beginning that her surviving the training seemed impossible. However, she was like a blooming flower in the sun, the more she was exposed to the life of her new faction, the more she became stronger, resilient, and flourished in her new surroundings. I think any of us could look up to Tris not literally, that girl is short as all getout. She never gave up no matter how much she was hurting or felt unwanted. I Am Number Four... Four is the kind of person youll love and hate through most of the novel. Hes a bit mysterious, somewhat caring, and a whole lot intimidating. He goes through these moods. One day hes as sweet as pie, then the next he is nicking your ear with a knife true story. But underneath his mood swings, he has a heart that beats for Tris. His goal is to help her survive the new cutthroat world she has been thrust into, even if that means being her enemy from time to time. I liked finding out about Four in short bursts of emotion. His background and his true motives stay a mystery for a good chunk of the novel. Of course, this made him all the more interesting. Its the End of the World as We Know It... The concept behind Divergent is undeniably frightening and intriguing at the same time. In this dystopian world, war has been eradicated by simply cultivating the best virtues that any human being can poses. But in Divergent they have separated these traits into factions that live apart. The problem is, acting in accordance to one virtue does not guarantee a peaceful society. Eliminating peoples innate kindness or mercy to be brave or doing away with a conscious selfworth to be solely selfless leaves people open to attack on many fronts. What makes us human is the ability to experience all that life has to offer; to be brave when its necessary or honest when its appropriate. To focus on only one part of yourself can warp your ideals into something dangerous. That is whats happening in the world of Divergent. Factions are being corrupted. And if the one faction meant to protect you is unraveling, what do you do? Maybe, just maybe, Tris and her uniqueness will be able to fix what has taken place and find a way to triumph over the darkness in the world. I guess we shall see as the trilogy goes on. A Punch in the Gut... I was shocked by the direction this book took. We do not get a happy endingat least not yet. The initiation Tris goes through was nerveracking on its own, and then Roth decides to punch us in the gut by bringing the world down around our ears. It was a nice surprise because it only made me want to read book 2, Insurgent, even more. The plot was well structured, the pacing perfect, and the suspense was phenomenal. I was terrified for Tris most of the time. I felt her emotions as she struggled to become what her faction required. The fear of her fellow cruel initiates was a constant throughout the book. The betrayals against Tris hit me just as hard as her. The astronomical changes in her left me out of breath and craving more. Every multidimensional characterthe bad guys, the good guys, and the inbetweenerscontributed to this amazing story. Roths ability to write such outstanding fiction at her young age gives me hope as a young writer myself. The Bad The only thing that bugged me was when Tris forgave people that I think were unforgivable. There was some major backstabbing in the book, and no matter what happened to those people, I wouldve never forgiven them. But maybe Im just pigheaded. The Snuggly The romance is pretty minor. It takes quite some time for Tris and Four to get together. I like the fact that Tris is not very attractive but Four likes her because of her strength and determination. It gave their relationship a solid foundation because they grew to respect each other first. Id say the book is pretty clean except for some unwanted sexual touching. Overall I actually have Insurgent on the way to my house right now. I couldnt wait to read book2, and since it took me so long to read Divergent, I didnt have to wait but a couple of days. Roth did an amazing job of taking captivating characters and a kickass and compassionate heroine, throwing them into a terrifying world, and adding just enough political corruption, action, and drama to produce one hell of a read. This is not the kind of book you can pass up. Any adult or young adult out there will fall in love with Divergent. Its a must read! Excerpt I hear the crash of water against rocks. We are near the chasmwe must be above it, given the volume of the sound. I press my lips together to keep from screaming. If we are above the chasm, I know what they intend to do to me. Lift her up, cmon. I thrash, and their rough skin grates against mine, but I know its useless. I scream too, knowing that no one can hear me here. I will survive until tomorrow, I will. The hands push me around and up and slam my spine into something hard and cold. Judging by its width and curvature, it is a metal railing. It is the metal railing, the one that overlooks the chasm. My breaths wheeze and mist touches the back of my neck. The hands force my back to arch over the railing. My feet leave the ground, and my attackers are the only thing keeping me from falling into the water.
Initial Reactions 2214:I cant decide between 3 and 4 stars. It was enjoyable. It was quick. But I saw it coming about 20 in so it was a bit anticlimactic for me. I think I would have loved it if I hadnt know it was a twist ending. If someone tells you theres a twist and when it happens, even if you dont know what it is, doesnt that take out all the fun? Instead of being surprised, I was looking for the twist and I found it early on. Updated three hours later: Yep, Im confident in 3 stars. It was enjoyable and quick and I actually read it in one sitting because I was so desperate to finish. I just didnt feel like the twist was anything new and I predicted it too easily. Im not saying that this is an unsatisfactory book AT ALL. I just have to rate it how I feel because it wasnt the stellar, mindblowing read for me. I can totally see how it knocked peoples socks off, but I was not one of those. Review originally posted on The Book Addicts Guide 42514: My review for WE WERE LIARS is a complicated thing to write. Obviously we know from all of the chatter so far that theres an interesting twist to this book and unfortunately, the chatter somehow spoiled the book for me without even talking about specific spoilers. Before I get into that, let me explain a bit more first. The narration of WE WERE LIARS is interesting but at times a bit confusing to me. The main character, Cady, suffers from unbearable migraines after an accident she suffered two years ago at her familys beach house and she cant remember the details of the accident. To make matters more complicated, no one will tell her what happened either. Cadys approach to filling the reader in is obviously limited. She has selective amnesia from the accident so the reader is very much attempting to discover what exactly happened with Cadys accident right along side her. I didnt find the lack of information confusing but one thing I did wish is that we had just a few more clues earlier on in the story. I didnt really pick up on anything to sort of help push me along to really wrap me up in the mystery. I understand being in the dark so the reveal to Cady is just as much of a shock to the reader, but with all of the hype around the surprising ending thats no spoiler  the buzz around the blogosphere is that the ending is one to die for!, the reveal was a bit TOO much information all at once. I really think the book could have benefitted from just tiny clues here and there because honestly? If I hadnt already known there was a twist coming, I may not have continued reading or it would have taken me a lot longer to finish. Im a sucker for a twist. I absolutely love being surprised and when I heard this book had a killer ending, I was so excited to read it, especially with all of the amazing feedback out there but... the hype monster totally got me on this one. Its a tricky situation when you hear a book has a fantastic twist. Thats not a spoiler, right? You cant fault anyone for saying a book has a twist because naturally people are wanting to discuss it and without saying what that twist is, no one is really spoiling the book. For me, hearing that WE WERE LIARS had a twisty ending inadvertently spoiled the book just a little bit for me. I never read any specifics but when I hear a book has a twist, what do I do? I go looking for it and guess what. I found it. About a quarter of the way through. I actually had a second guess later on the book which was the wrong one but that kept me on my toes trying to guess if it was one of the two possible outcomes I had surmised. I was actually kind of hoping I was wrong so I would be totally surprised but I did enjoy it... It just didnt knock me off my feet since I was able to see it coming. As much as I REALLY want to discuss the reasons how I spotted it, obviously I cant do that so I dont spoil it for you guys! : I did enjoy the ending. It didnt knock my socks off, as previously stated, but its a concept I really love and enjoy and totally commend authors for pulling off. That being said, I was also a bit disappointed with it at the same time. Again, for spoiler reasons, I wont delve into why I was disappointed, but if youve already read the book, Id love to discuss! If you havent read, no, I will not tell you how this ends! The other pro and con of this book for me was the length. I really appreciated being able to be swept away by this book in one sitting on a Sunday morning with the book at just under 250 pages Goodreads currently locks it in at 240 and with all of the hefty books on my TBR, I always appreciate reading a shorter one! At the same time, I feel like this book could have benefitted a little from a few more pages. I appreciated the characters but felt they could have been a little bit more developed. I dont think I ever understood exactly how the group of teens had come to be called the Liars. I could have used even a few sentences to a paragraph of tiny, tiny clues in the beginning or middle to keep me invested in the story. I would have liked to see the romance between Cady and Gat developed a little bit more. I really liked being able to finish this book so quickly but there were still quite a few things that I felt the book could have benefitted from in those extra pages. So what can I possibly say for this book at the end of this review? READ IT. I hope youre one of the people who is truly blown away and just entangled in the mystery of this book. I had a few qualms about it and probably my biggest issues was that I sort of ended up spoiling it for myself, but it really was interesting and jarring.
Traveling Back in Time: I decided to take a little trip back in time and reread The Time Machine by H. G. Wells. I dont remember how old I was when I first read the book, but having read the as an adult, Im surprised that as a child, I enjoyed a book with a lot of philosophy and philosophic discussions. The nice thing about returning to a book I read decades ago is that it was fresh and often surprising. Brief Summary: Our Victorian time traveler, invents a time machine, and travels forward to the year 802701 C.E. By anyones standards, its an ambitious leap into the future. In this far distant future, the wealthy and upper class in England have evolved into the Eloi, carefree, simpleminded beings. They spend their days eating, playing, having sex and generally waltzing through life. Although the buildings are in disrepair and the Eloi are frighten of the dark, the land is beautiful and the time traveler seems to have landed in a utopian society. As soon as the time traveler lands, he has a sense that hes being watched and that all isnt exactly right. But his feelings are put aside as he spends the day with the Eloi. When he returns to his machine, its missing, and the suspense he felt when he landed returns. His top priority is to find his machine so he can return home. He makes friends with Weena, a female Eloi, and discovers that the Eloi are not the only inhabitants. The Morlocks, a race of subterranean beings who evolved from the working class, maintain the underground machines that support the Eloi. The Time Traveler quickly realizes the Morlocks are dangerous. The story question at this point is will the time traveler find his machine and return to Victorian England? And will he stay put if he does get back? General Observations: I think I appreciated this book far more reading it as an adult than I did when I read it as a child. I can see the historical issues and philosophies being played out in the story. However, the first time I read The Time Machine the story was intriguing and fun. So, I guess I can say it still works for the young and the old. In Wells time, culture and society were changing. Rights and the treatment of the working classes were issues, which this book brings those issues to the foreground. The upper and middleclasses with too much leisure and little work have deteriorated into weak, simple minded beings who play all day. While the working classes are underground, out of sight and out of mind, but they come out at night and are excessively dangerousa warning of ignoring the plight and needs of the workingclass. Often the narrative is flavored with discourses on the class structure and problems of Wells time. This works because the Time Traveler is telling a group of friends what happened to him. His side commentary seems a natural part of the story. For people with a good grasp of high school sciences, much of the storys science wouldnt hold up today, but I dont think this is a problem. I dont insist that my science fiction is based on hard science, so it was easy enough to suspend my disbelief. The book was written over a hundred years ago, 1895, so its easy to make allowances. What I Liked: 1. The story holds up surprisingly well. Its a simple story, much less sophisticated and complex than contemporary stories, but enjoyable. 2. The descriptions have a wow factor. Wells is exploring the ideas of evolution and how the earth and people might evolve. The vivid descriptions were a pleasure to read and not overwhelming as some Victorian literature. 3. The philosophical discussions were engaging. Yeah, this one surprised me, but the observations did fit into the tone of the novel and seemed natural. Negatives: Okay, I like to balance the What I Liked section with something equal to What I Didnt Like; however, Im having some trouble coming up with list of negatives. As I said earlier, some of the science could be griped about, but Im not inclined to do that. I have one gripe, but really, its more of a personal opinion than a critique of the story. I dont agree with the way the Eloi and the Morlocks evolved. I dont think all violence and intelligence would disappear from the Eloi race; nor do I think the Morlocks would have the intelligence to run the machines for the Eloi and have evolved to be aggressive and violent without somewhere along the line rebelling, pushing to live above ground, and creating weapons. I understand that during the industrial revolution that many wealthy people couldnt adjust to the changes and thus were not progressive and didnt understand the need to change or lose everything; however, I think Wells underestimated human intelligence and human aggression in both the Eloi and Morlocks. Even in Wells time, many adjusted and flowed along with and changed with the times, and the time period was rife with workingclass demands and rebellions, which we know resulted in change. However, I wont fault Wells for not having a prophetic knowledge of the future. So the basic instinct for survival, human aggression, and human intelligence would survive evolution. All that aside, its a fun story. If you havent read it in a while or if youre never read it, do. Take a stroll back in time.
Overall I give this book 3.5 stars and in this spoiler tainted review Im going to tell you why. We start out the book with this girl named Mare living in an extremely complex but intriguing world. Either you bleed red and are common or you bleed silver and have super natural abilities. I absolutely loved, loved, loved that about this book. It was cool and unique with an interesting monarchy. The characters werent flat and had layers to them, different dimensions I enjoyed peeling away as I read. The writing craft of this book was well done obviously and it was beautifully done. The idea of blood and super natural powers was freaking cool. I also FUCKING LOVED OUR MAIN CHARACTER MARE. I liked her a lot because she was smart but so plain and average and normal but could do extraordinary things. She was a smart girl but like the rest of us sometimes did foolish things. We all do stuff like. I enjoyed her because she was realistic. And Cal. LET US NOT GET STARTED WITH MOTHER FUCKING CAL BECAUSE ASDFHKLFKSJJKLASSH I was so freaking in love with him it wasnt even funny. I loved him from the moment he grabbed Mares hand in front of the bar. There was something about him that was so different from other guys in YA. He was calm, calculated, lethal, and crazy intelligent. I loved that he didnt declare his undying love for our protagonist thirty pages into the story. He was hard to read and THEIR ROMANCE YES I SAID ROMANCE GIVES ME ANGSTY FEELS. When it came to Maven I never hated him but I didnt particularly like him. He had his moments but from the start something was fishy about him. Our other characters were fine from the sweethearts to the bitches thats right I called you out Evangeline I want to point out what I DIDNT like about this story. Way too many typical fucking YA stereotypes. I was just like this is SUCH A GOOD BOOK WITH A GREAT WORLD AND INTERESTING CHARACTERS WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO AND SCREW SHIT UP WITH TYPICAL NONSENSE This book wouldve been a million times better had it stuck to the idea of this girl with super natural abilities she could not understand. It wouldve been better for them to lightly dip into a sort of defiance rather than go into a whole COPY CAT HUNGER GAMES FACE OF THE REBELLION STUNT LIKE WHAT WERE YOU THINK WHEN YOU USED THOSE EXACT WORDS HOW HAS SUZANNE COLLINS NOT SUED YOU FOR DOING THAT YET. I also couldnt stomach the idea of a sort of love triangle. Even though its clear from the beginning that Mare loves Cal AFTER SHE SO ANNOYINGLY DISREGARDS HER FEELINGS LIKE A TYPICAL YA GIRL FIGHTING HOW SHE FEELS LIKE OH NO I DONT LOVE HIM OH I DONT KNOW WHAT THIS FEELING IS BETWEEN US OH LET ME NOT LOOK AT HIM. So. Annoying. After I had around 70 pages left I got tired of waiting so I went ahead and skipped to the end. Turns out that asshole Maven was a traitor and I was right. I was a little sad to see the King die tbh. I never really had any beef with him. OH and lets not get started with the cycle of stupidity. As much as I loved these characters people like Mare, Cal, Julian, and Kilorn pissed me off sometimes. It was like one stupid thing set off a ripple affect that just sent everyone into doing stupid things. Sometimes their view on things made no sense. I couldnt understand how Mare went from this smart clever girl to all of a sudden being stupid and saying IM GOING TO HELP THE SCARLET GUARD NO MATTER WHAT like..... Werent you just concentrated on finding out why you had powers? Werent you keen on not letting the sadness of your brothers death blind your judgement? I also didnt like how easily she went along with things she so clearly knew were wrong like come on Mare. Youre a smart girl. You know better than that. As much as I adore Cal sometimes he got but frustrated because Im thinking to myself youre clearly in love with this girl and youre just going to go on like that, sneaking kisses and such, knowing youre engaged and shes going to marry your brother? Come on Cal. I really, really, really, loved so many things about this book. I loved their world and the early story line but I wasnt crazy once they took the rebellion route. Im ok with a little rebellion. Just try and make it original. I wanted to see Mare try and uncover what happened to the late Queen, try and figure out why she is the way she is, and give the palace Hell as an act of defiance. I think Mare is a freaking extraordinary character. I think she has potential for so, so, so much more. Hopefully in future books Ill see development and well needed change. Please dont let the thirst for rebellion destroy the idea of Mare finding out whats wrong with her. And please no annoying romance. I loved the romance, I love the fact that they want to be together and in trying to save each other they betray each other and hurt each other, it causes for lots of drama and angst. But dont be annoying about it. Let them admit they love each other in the second book, lets get some good well deserved steamy make out scenes, and move on. I want to see them work at having a relationship. THIS SERIES HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE UNIQUE AND AWESOME PLEASE DO NOT FALL INTO THE TYPICAL STYLE OF BOOKS IN THE YA BRANCH. Please Victoria. I love this book. Dont make me sad. OH and I want a novel from Cals POV because Lilly out.
FULL REVIEW: Cress is my first five star read of 2014, and for good reason! Basically, this book deserves a love letter as I simply loved everything about it  the characters, the stories, the feels. Even though the sheer length of this novel seems intimidating, I tore through it in a couple of days. If youre looking for a series that gets even better with each book, the Lunar Chronicles is one such series and Cress is certainly proof of that. One of the things I love most about Cress is that the story, as with its predecessors, is full of twists and turns. Every time it looks like things are going to fall into place and work out perfectly, something happens and the st hits the fan! Each installment of the Lunar Chronicles has gradually gotten more actionpacked as the stakes have risen, and the way its executed is just so perfect. All the craziness in Cress felt like a roller coaster ride designed to pull me in all different directions, even when I wasnt prepared. It was seriously a thrilling, exhilarating  Midori: My mistress is currently recovering from the extreme feels induced by the memory of her Cress reading experience. She will return once she has managed to regain her composure. For the moment, you will be entertained by me, her android friend. In the meantime, dare I say that my favorite part of this novel is the character Iko? She is the epitome of a solid secondary character. Now that Ive sufficiently recovered from my feels, lets move on to something Midori already mentioned  the characters in Cress. The characters are honestly what make this book series so special! Since we have quite a number of them, let me make it easy for you and put my thoughts into a comprehensive list. Cinder continues to demonstrate very human qualities, even as her cyborg capabilities come to her aid time and again. Shes dealing with the mounting pressure of all these obligations and emotional ties, and it threatens to overwhelm her more than once here. Her bravery, her sense of responsibility and her need to do the right thing are probably my three favorite qualities. Kai, too, is understandably under a lot of pressure as hes the leader of his country and trying to come to terms with his impending marriage to Queen Levana of the Lunars. Hes so admirable though, because he works so hard to be steadfast, honorable, good and sacrifices everything for the sake of his beloved country. Scarlet is very much the same person she is in her own book  good, sweet, loyal, fair. Shes still fighting for the people she loves, even if shes not as skilled as everyone else. My heart broke over her in this one multiple times, and I just wanted to scoop her up into a hug by the end. Wolf is decidedly different in this book. Oh sure, when hes being controlled or in fighting mode, hes still aggressive and intimidating. But after something that happens early on, he withdraws into himself, turning into a zombie instead of a fighter. While Im sure that this made others feel like he wasnt as likable, I understood why it was so, and so I still love him lots! Iko, as Midori has mentioned, is a wonderful character! Shes still sassy, always ready with a comeback for any discussion. But she also accepts the gravity of a situation when necessary, and is willing to stand by Cinder and the others in the fight against Levana. Her intelligent contributions and her enthusiasm and not just about fashion are two of the best things about her. Dr. Erland is a brilliant, calculating character. Readers will note that he was absent for most of Scarlet, but that changes here. Hes a complicated character because its uncertain whether he can be trusted or not for most of this novel. But his story twist just tore at my heart completely when it was finally revealed, and brought tears into my eyes. Queen Levana is a lot scarier, which means she becomes an even more believable villain. Her evil plans become clearer, her inhumane treatment of enemies is downright horrifying and she just makes me want to run screaming whenever shes mentioned. Jacin and Winter are two new characters introduced her, and theyre really interesting. Jacin is one of the Lunar guards, but its interesting to see hes only loyal to his princess. Winter, on the other hand, is the one Im more curious about; she seems like a mix of crazy with good intentions, but only time and her book will tell. Cress might be naive and inexperienced, having spent seven of her formative years trapped in a satellite. But shes also extremely good at what she does know how to do, which is basically hacking and surveillance. She earned lots of points with me for being brave and strong, even in the face of all the unfamiliar situations she finds herself in. She pushed her boundaries, and its pretty awesome to watch. Thorne is still very much as he was in Scarlet  cool, sarcastic, and perhaps slightly arrogant. What I loved best about him now was his surprising vulnerability. He has to learn how to rely on other people, which is something that frustrates and irritates him. Its interesting to see that a lot of his emotions are pulled into the open even as he opens himself up to others. That certainly helped me fall even more in love with him! While these characters are all great individually, their relationships also add strength to Cress. It was always fun to see the merry band of rogues, as Ive dubbed them, together, whether its plotting and scheming, or in the thick of a fight. The romances KaiCinder, WolfScarlet, ThorneCress were all slightly on the back burner, but the feels definitely burned strong. There were lots of fleeting little moments that simply meant the world to me and had me grinning like a fool and swooning like a  Midori: Mistress has currently started babbling incoherently about her extreme swooning, and will return shortly. I, myself, am particularly enamored with Captain Carswell Thorne, as he has been nothing but heroic in this book. I certainly felt for him as Mistress did, especially when he was  I hate to interrupt Midori, but she might well have spoiled Cress for you readers. We cant let that happen now, can we? But her last statement is certainly a perfect segue into the feels part of this review. I feel very fortunate indeed that I had people Hiiii Judith  Jen! I could talk to while I was reading though occasionally Midori had to take over when I was incapable of messaging properly. I honestly dont know how I could have survived without being able to share all my feels with someone! Reading Cress, as Ive mentioned, is like a roller coaster ride  a number of highs, a number of lows, and the craziest of turns. Every so often, Id need to stop for a breather so that I could regain my composure before I started again. Cress made me laugh, and it made me cry. It basically made me feel so many things, and I loved that aspect of it so, so much. The last chapter of Cress is the perfect sort of ending  one that satisfies the reader, but also leaves the reader anticipating what happens next. As Ive said in my reviews of the previous books in this series, Marissa Meyer is a brilliant author and I look forward to seeing how she wraps up this story in the next and final installment, Winter.

 spoiler alert  This book was adorably sad and it has a moral most people can relate to. Actual Review Spoilers May be Present also if you are easily triggered by talking about depression anxiety  mental illness or suicide I would not advise you to read this novel: Hiya Guys Welcome to the Nether! Today I am going to be talking about All the Bright Places by Jennifer Niven. This book was adorably heartbreaking story about two teenagers falling in love and one of them and ends up committing suicide. The story starts off as very high staked place and then ends in a very peaceful manner. Honestly I had a certain connection with the male main character Fitch and how he feels like the world around him is ultimately against him. Even though he loses the battle he fixes somebody else who is having the same feelings as he was before he died. This is the novel that I truly if ever became a author wanted to make to make people feel that they werent alone, but a guess Jennifer Niven got there before me so without furtherer a due lets get to the points of the novel and what I felt: Point 1: I usually talk about the romance first and thats what I am going to do because thats what most of the book is about before the climax. I can tell that a lot of the romance in the novel is an aspect or just the feeling of being in love type of romance does not really make any sense because there was not really a lot of development in the way the characters loved each other but being that they were teenagers who just wanted to be loved, the under development of the romance made a lot of sense. When you were teenager you probably wouldve thought the same way as these characters do usually people would just go out with people just to go out with people and they didnt go out with each other right away, actually I dont even think they made it official in the novel, and this was so sad because of the way the male main character dies without concluding that. I felt like they were in their honeymoon phase for most of the relationship because it was so new and fresh and then the sad part happens and theres really nothing you can do about it. Point 2:The plot this book had a moral to it, and that is what makes this book so special on the count if you see the characters around finch who is the person that committed suicide you would see that they never wouldve guessed that he would have done this to himself. I would understand completely that Finch felt alone in his little world and even though you have a loving girlfriend and people who cared about him, people with depression and anxiety dont really see that until all hope is lost. I also would know that they will not tell you how they actually feel because they personally dont know why they feel that way themselves. Finch looked like he had bipolar disorder where he was either really depressed at one point in the novel and really happy at other points. For someone who was abused  bullied and neglected all throughout his life it would be understandable that he feels all these things, and one little thing was trying to make him happy and that was Violet. Violet being a outsider looking in did not know what to do, and that makes anyone feel helpless. Mrs. Niven shows the two sided affect of suicide in a way that would make teenagers understand the hardships. Point 3: in terms of the attitudes of the characters I would say that it was not really that believable because I dont think that a lot of teenagers read poetry especially from classical writers, but it makes a cute point to bring it into the story as that is what makes the characters connect. Its kind a like when Finch said about the gravitational pull when you love someone with all your heart it is like something in the universe is pulling them together, almost like knitting them to be one being. I felt that whenever I laughed at something silly Finch said or the way they flirted with eachother. Granted I felt like there was a lot of sex in this book and was kind of unnecessary but whatever they were sex hungry teenagers, and maybe thats what teenagers in this generation do I dont know. Point 4: What I really enjoyed about this book is how Mrs. Niven betrayed the characters around Finch and the atmosphere of the book in general. A lot of people argue about this book about it being really unrealistic but in my perspective this book is actually very realistic by getting to its point. After someone dies a suicide the others around them get impacted in a different way then the victim, when the victim finds peace but also evolves around the people that were involved with the victim. Its almost like a domino effect. Even though Violet was fixed by Finch Violet could not fix Finch, and now even though he is gone she will forever hold a piece of him within her fragile heart. I am definitely going to be reading the new book that just came out by Jennifer Niven and God I hope it doesnt break my heart. In Conclusion for ultimately affecting me and probably making this the most heartfelt review I ever made in my life I am going to give all the bright places a 4.5 star rating. Like I said above I had some issues with the book but it wasnt so prominent for me to give this book a lower rating then a four star because I felt like there was reasons behind some of the things that were issues in the book and could be solved but this is a standalone novel were not going to get any more especially because want to make characters is dead and even though there was not a steady Conclusion  I still enjoyed it. Heartbreaking and mortal I will see you the next time I read a novel! Wait  crap I forgot to address. I do highly appreciate that in back of the book she talks her history of suicide, and Finch is based on a true person, and that she puts the help phone number saying that you were never alone. If anybody feels like this they should call the number seriously because you dont want to end up like Finch. Know that your never alone and you can talk to me if you feel like this Ill listen guys. UPDATE: THIS BOOK IS BECOMING A MOVIE AND IM NOT READY I CANT SEE FINCH DIE TWICE HELP ME!!! BYE
 spoiler alert  Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. I wasnt sure if I was going to write about this book because I dont write that much about YA. And, I am sure that some of you are scratching your heads a bit to see me posting about a new release in the midst of Shakespeare Reading Month. But the simple fact is: I really love Young Adult Fiction. It wasnt always that way. When I was a high schooler, there wasnt a lot to pick from in the YA section. There was a lot of fluff and only a few books of substance. That has gone through a significant change. I rediscovered YA in college, and in particular, when I took a YA literature course. That course taught me a lot about literature maybe even more than my serious classes, but the one thing that sticks out was my professor telling us, Young Adult fiction is slowly becoming the most important literature coming out today. It is the only division of literature that allows for and welcomes significant change. All of the exciting literature is coming from there. And I have to agree. While I can certainly name popular adult books, I can think of far more young adult books to hit the scene with more power and gusto. Twilight. Harry Potter. The Hunger Games. Percy Jackson. And the list goes on. John Green is one of the YA authors that I have the most respect for because his books uphold a very high standard. All of his novels are realistic, passionate, and wellwritten. When I open one of his books, I know that I will find a lot to love. Unfortunately, I couldnt buy this when it came out, and I was a bit heartbroken I was going to have to wait to read it. My mother saw my sad facebook status the day the book came out and went to purchase the book for me thanks mom!. I brought it down to Florida with me, and I started it at 11pm one night. I ended up going to bed just before 2:30 that morning, after reading the book straight through. Green has not disappointed me and has confirmed what I have come to strongly believethat Young Adult fiction is important and should be valued higher than it is. When a writer can create something this powerful and wonderful, the naysayers of YA fiction need to check themselves. For those who dont know, The Fault in Our Stars is about Hazel, a 16yearold teenager battling terminal cancer. She is currently okay, thanks to a miracle drug that is giving her more time. She isnt in school, but instead finished high school at home and takes community college courses. She has to lug an oxygen tank around with her wherever she goes, and wheezes without it. There is a scene where a young girl asks about the tubes in her nose, and Hazel has to explain it. I cannot imagine that kind of existence. Life has dealt her a crappy hand, but she seems to be surviving, pushing through, and accepting the way things are. She meets Augustus Waters at a group session for teens with cancer. The two immediately become fast friends and where Hazel has clear evidence of her disease, it seems as if Augustus is fine. But remember, this is a book about kids with cancer, and Green points out clearly in the beginning that both teens are really living on borrowed time. Now, I read a lot of Lurlene McDaniel books as a young preteen. Those books were full of kids battling cancer, falling in love, and struggling with parents. And while I drank them all up with longing and the idea that love could conquer everything, like cancer, they did not have the impact that Greens novel had. Perhaps I was so deeply moved by Greens novel because of the family members in my life who have fought cancer since my bout with the tragic love stories in McDaniels books. I lost my paternal grandfather immediately after my high school graduation because of a battle with cancer. I lost my paternal grandmother a few years ago the Monday before Thanksgiving to a battle with cancer. I was holding her hand when she passed away. Matts mother battled breast cancer last year and is in remission, and his stepdad is currently undergoing chemo treatments for lymphoma. Let me tell you, cancer is not beautiful or lovely. It is rough and frustrating and nothing like those Lurlene McDaniel books I read when I was younger. Cancer isnt fair. It attacks not only the person with the disease, but those around them. I remember driving my grandmother to treatments and listening to her talk in the car about how she hated it. How much she hated that she knew she had limited time left. She could do nothing about it and neither could I. But Green tackles that head on. He doesnt gloss over cancerno, that is part of his main focus. Hazel mentions at one point in the book that she is a grenadeready to explode at any point to hurt those around her. She cannot control when or where. It is that kind of statement that makes Greens novel so powerful. He doesnt dumb down the pain or the impact of what the disease does. I commend him for that. The biggest thing I found to love in the novel was Augustus obsession with leaving a legacy. I think we all feel this a bit, and maybe more so when you know you are living on borrowed time. I found that I could relate to Augustus. He felt that as a teen, he had so much left to live and would be leaving nothing behind. I could understand that feeling, and I think it is a feeling that rings true for so many of us. We want to be remembered not just by those we intimately knew, but by everyone. I know that when I lost my grandparents I felt a bit of anger that so many people didnt know how wonderful they were. I wanted to scream it out, but couldnt. Augustus only wants to be known for something other than being a kid with cancer. That is what drives him, what frustrates him, and what he discusses with Hazelthat the cancer cannot define who they are. They must strive to battle the cancer and live a life for themselvesone not ruled by treatments, drugs, and scary results. The must live for an infinite amount of time and build something for themselves and their families. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. When I finished reading the novel, I was alone in the very dark hours of early morning. I read the last portion of the novel with a lump in my throat and tears burning in my eyes because it is that type of book. It was real and powerful and everything I expected from Green and more. The teenagers felt like teenagers. Of course they were far cleverer than I ever was at that age, but I knew people like them. I could relate to their very real struggles, and of course, the love they felt for one another. It was a beautiful, beautiful book. It made me think long and hard about the purpose of life, my own legacy, and how much I love reading beautiful books with meaning. This is one you shouldnt miss.

This review was originally posted on Ticket to Anywhere Places Traveled To: Shady Creek, Georgia  Atlanta, Georgia First Lines: Its a weirdly subtle conversation. I almost didnt notice I was being blackmailed. Writing a review for a book that I adored are sometimes the hardest reviews that I have to write. Its so easy to pick out the things you didnt like about a story but when you love it so much that you simply want to crawl into its pages and live there forever? Not as easy to find the words. At least, words strung together in such a way that makes sense to those not living inside of my head. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli is one of those books where I feel all the feels and I may have already read it more than once even though I just finished it the other day. Its such a Mary Poppins story that is nearly perfect in every way and I just hated for it to end. Like for reals. My new mission in my bookish life is to pester Becky Albertalli over and over until she writes a companion story so that I can get more from this world and these characters. My love of Simon knows no bounds. I loved his voice and his POV and just everything about him. Hes real and down to earth and hell make your heart swoon. I love his relationships with those around him, his best friends and his family and best of all there is no pointless drama in this book!!! Oh the pointless drama is such a pet peeve of mine and its so refreshing to find a book that doesnt have that. Yes, there is conflict and issues but they arent over the top and they cant easily be solved by two people talking to each other. Because Simon and Blue talk all the time. At least, they do via email and they are so open and honest with each other. Oh how I loved those email exchanges and my only regret is that there werent more of them. Another thing I loved about Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda was the inclusion of parents within the story. Through Simon we learn about the various family units of his friends but who I loved most were Simons parents. They were much like mine in that they had jobs and they were involved in my life. I loved how they made a big deal out of everything because so often those small moments can be overlooked. I liked how when Simon messed up he faced consequences and when he was in a play at school they treated it as if he had the lead roll and not just a supporting part. They made me smile with every appearance on the page and I was just so happy to see a happy family unit. Too often in YA reads the parents are either dead, absent, or there but so selfabsorbed that they might as well not be there at all. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda also made my heart ache. I understood Blues reluctance to break through the wall of anonymity that the email exchanges gave him and Simon. To leave that safety and bring things to the real world. Especially in a smallish sized town where there arent many openly gay people its hard. Especially since the reality of a person can be so different than their onliner persona. But with every email exchange I kept hoping that in that one, that moment, Blue would be all for a meeting with Simon. It was for this moment that I kept flipping hurriedly through the pages as I was desperate to know who Blue was and where this story would go. And let me tell you, the ending of Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda, oh my stars, that ending was perfect. So very perfect. This whole book was perfection. Seriously. Which is not something that I think Ive ever said about a book before. Ever. Oh I am sure that there are flaws within its pages but Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda just hit all the right notes with me. It made me feel and when I hit that final page I sighed a happy sigh and hugged the book for all of the loveliness within its pages. It truly saddens me that I can never read this one again for the first time but I do know that it will be reread often and I will fall more in love with its story and its characters each and every time. Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda is a book that you need to have on your radar. Its a book that I think everyone should read. If you only read one book this year than this is the book that it should be. This is something else that I dont say that often but I just feel so strongly about this book that I want to use all the cliches and all the words and all the everything I can in order to get YOU yes YOU!! to read this book. If I could buy everyone a copy of Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda I would but I cant. Its unputdownable and your life will be just a little bit better for having read it. P.S.A.: When you do pick up Simon vs the Homo Sapiens be sure to have a package of Oreos handy because this book will make you crave them. Add Something Real by Heather Demetrios to Goodreads.

I have loved every book that Ive read that has been written by Alessandra Torre and although Moonshot isnt my favorite from her, I dont think Ive loved any characters more than I loved Ty and Chase. There was just something about both these two that settled deep in my heart from the very start. Ty grew up amongst the boys, her life out there on the field, rooted in Yankee blue. After the passing of her mother, a seven year old girls life changes when she joins her father, closer for the NY Yankees. Her new life involves team busses, jet setting to away games and breathing in the smells of freshly mowed grass, misted down dirt, the roar and the stomps of a stadium full of fans. She never imaged that at seventeen the trade that brought Chase Stern to his dream of pinstripes would be the moment when her heart would forever be owned. Now barely 18, Chase new he should not find stolen moments with Ty, but all was lost the first moment she smiled at him. A man with a reputation suddenly finds a chance at redemption as he falls hard... but nothing in this world is ever perfect and quicker than an ump can shout out, Chase is traded again, Ty is having to make hard choices and four years pass before Chase returns. But it isnt just about baseball, it isnt just about a second chance at love, or new commitments that stand in their way. There is something far more sinister and no one seems to have figured out how the Yankees, Ty, Chase or the drive to become Series Champs all tie into the deaths of those women. Although this was at times a sweet contemporary romance, the suspense was there  lurking underneath the surface. I adored everything about this book. The hidden clues, the insights to things it gave, but not until the very end when you had all the answers did those things make sense. I loved that we got those moments of Ty growing up, to show us what this team meant to her  to see what her choices could cost her, the sacrifice. And Chase, oh Chase... he was lovable in that, slap the smirk off his face, way  but once you got past that hurdle of his hurt and the wreckage it could cause, you saw into him and you loved him fiercely. Chase could turn this Yankee hater into a fan ready to shed her forest green for blue.... well almost ; There are a few things about this book that stood out. It might seem odd to include the format of the chapters to that, but it did. I am a sucker for a dual pov, but I need those to have purpose, not just a steady roll out of hisherhisherhisher until you are left dizzy and wondering how those moments would have looked through the other characters eye. Alessandras selection for these moments were perfect. Even when that entire chapter was just a few sentence of the way Chase felt in that moment. Absolute perfection, in that moment I would have begged and pleaded on my knees to know how he felt and she gave it to us. The way she built the suspense but lured you into this false sense of security all at the same time, was done flawlessly. I had a million ideas in my head but I was certain, absolutely certain I was on the right track. I was so wrong but also knowing that shed twist this to its breaking point, that I found some solace that my outlandish guesses werent so far off. There was angst, drama, suspense, all of it... but I had such complete faith in one thing throughout this book. From the moment Chase tells her he loves her all those years ago  I knew it to be true. Deep in your bones love. It was the sort of love you cheered for, the kind you want to believe exists because it softens the hardness of the world. The type of love that makes you smile because something that pure exists. So yeah, I guess it is completely safe to say that Ty and Chase are my favorites sorry Brad, I still love your nine inches but.... This also stirred up some personal feels for this reader. As a girl growing up in the Bay Area of California and in a household that struggled to live just on the cusp of what some would consider bluecollar, baseball was an easy and cheap form of entertainment for us. I spent years with my butt glued to the bleachers in CenterRight field. It was my home away from home. For six years I spent every Friday night home game in my spot, amongst the diehard fans that showed up without fail. It was the place where I sat next to my father and bonded and the place where as I discovered boys, fled and wandered the stands just out or reach of my fathers eye. I felt like I owned that place during those years. I knew the staff, I had my way of getting past those guards that blocked the cheap seats to the expensive ones and I had my way of getting into those coveted skyboxes when the mood struck me just right, to wave to my father across the span of the field, binoculars pulled tight against my face as he laughed and shook his head at the antics of his daughter. For those years, I lived for those games. There is something about being so entrenched in a sport that you become part of the experience. From running on the field, feeling the grass cool to the touch and walking through the areas that fans dont often get to see. Some of the best moments of my youth are part of that stadium and because of that, I felt so close to Ty through this book, Alessandra nailed those feelings so flawlessly. Another stellar release, another AT book that will hit my top reads list for the year and another story that stole my heart within the few hours I spent curled up, lost within the pages.
4.5 stars. 5 stars? NO TRIANGLE. Or any kind of geometry. The synopsis is purposefully misleading  and for good reason! Check out a swoony excerpt ! Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog Tell Me Three Things by Julie Buxbaum Publisher: Delacorte Press Publication Date: April 5, 2016 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC sent by the publisher Summary from Goodreads: Everything about Jessie is wrong. At least, thats what it feels like during her first week of junior year at her new ultraintimidating prep school in Los Angeles. Just when shes thinking about hightailing it back to Chicago, she gets an email from a person calling themselves SomebodyNobody SN for short, offering to help her navigate the wilds of Wood Valley High School. Is it an elaborate hoax? Or can she rely on SN for some muchneeded help? Its been barely two years since her mothers death, and because her father eloped with a woman he met online, Jessie has been forced to move across the country to live with her stepmonster and her pretentious teenage son. In a leap of faithor an act of complete desperationJessie begins to rely on SN, and SN quickly becomes her lifeline and closest ally. Jessie cant help wanting to meet SN in person. But are some mysteries better left unsolved? What I Liked: I took a chance with this book; Im not a YA contemporary person, and I knew that the romance in this book could go in several different directions. Obviously we all want her to end up with her secret emailing admirer even without reading the book, youre rooting for him!, but we also know that the person emailing her might not be someone she likes away from the screen. So, I was worried about a love triangle or something of the sort. I am very happy to report that there was a very linear romance, and the story was beautiful and heartwrenching and lovely! Jessies mother died two years ago. Her father remarried, and now she and her dad are living in L.A. with his new rich wife Rachel, and Rachels son Theo. Rachel is paying for Jessie to attend a very fancy and preppy private school, Wood Valley High School. Jessies first week is a disaster, and most people noticed  specifically, an anonymous person referred to as SomebodyNobody, who emails Jessie, encouraging her and telling her details about Wood Valley High. Jessie is wary at first, but finds herself chatting online with SN more and more. She wants to meet her peer, who knows who she is, and has been a friend throughout the rough transition. But what if the person behind the screen isnt someone she likes in real life? This book was absolutely stunning, inside and out. Can we just talk about the cover for a second? I thought it was interesting, when I first saw it, and that was one of the reasons why I accepted the book for review. But now that Ive read the book, I can appreciate the cover even more. Waffle is Jessies favorite word, and it has another significance in the book several, actually. Love! Oh Jessie. Her pain and anger and frustration and numbness felt so real and tragic. I could see myself reacting exactly as she did, in terms of the big move, her father ignoring her feelings, her new stepmother, her new stepbrother, her new school. I love Jessie so much  she is someone to whom I can relate, someone real, someone likable. Even if you arent entirely like her, you can relate to her on some level. Jessie is downtoearth especially compared to these snobs in Wood Valley High, intelligent, determined, hardworking, smart with money, humble... someone that I would be friends with, in real life. I LOVE how real all of Buxbaums characters seemed to me! Wood Valley High is very different from my high school, yet the high school experience is for the most part is at least similarly and generally understood by most. This high school is filled with rich snobs, with perfect hair, model good looks, weird organic food... Ive never been to L.A., but I can stretch my imagination and believe it. Anyway, secondary characters. Jessies new friends Dri and Agnes are so sweet. Agnes is a little strange at first, but I liked her. Theo, Jessies stepbrother, seems like a tool at first, but I warmed up to him quickly. Hes actually a nice guy though I still refuse to think of him as a decent guy. We have our potential SN guys: Caleb, a rando who doesnt really play a big role throughout the book, but is very convincingly like SN. Liam, a senior, who plays a larger role in the book, and has been nice to Jessie from the start. And Ethan, Jessies English partner for a project, who is goodlooking but also a bit cold. Distant? He plays a huge role in the book, especially as Jessies partner for the English project. Ill just say it  there is no love triangle. Or square. Or pentagon, pyramid, rhombus, whatever. No geometry whatsoever, except for a straight line. The romance in this book is VERY linear. I love the romance, honestly. Jessie falls for this certain guy in real life, and she also develops a strong connection to SN. Whoever is behind the screen is someone that understands and cares about her, and by the climax of the book, Jessie is convinced that its one of those three boys. I really like how the romance turned out. TRUST ME when I say that there is no love triangle. There is emotional and physical interaction only with one guy... the right guy. wink So thats the romance. And I mentioned the characters. I also loved the toughissue story, how heartbreaking and inspiring the story is. Loving a parent, and then the other to a stepmother, moving crosscountry, starting over in a school filled with people that look down on you... nothing comes easy, for Jessie. I love her strength of character, and how she grows as the story continues. This book isnt so gritty and difficult to read that a noncontemporary person like me would stop reading. No, this book was beautiful and achingly sweet to read. I am so pleased with this book. The story is incredible, the heroine is so strong and inspiring, and the romance is really sweet, without having any physical intimacy which is so great, in its own way. I kind of love how Jessie is able to connect with someone so powerfully, in this age of technology and behindthe screen interactions. I really adored this book! What I Did Not Like: I know I just said how I loved that this book had no physical intimacy in it like the only kiss comes at the very end, in the reveal scene. BUT I also personally find this to be a negative because I looove physical interactions in a book that has such a great romance in it! However I can see how that wouldnt really fit, in this book. But still. Would I Recommend It: I so recommend this book! Im not even a YA contemporary person, and Im recommending it. Have you seen the amount of positive reviews on Goodreads? This book is so worth the buzz that has been floating around. Give it a chance! I tend to stay far away from YA contemporary  especially those dealing with tough issues, but this book was really worth the read. Rating: 4.5 stars  rounded down to 4 stars Im not really sure why Im rounding down, but it doesnt quite feeling like a fivestar read to me. Such a wonderful book, and a fast read, too! Im glad I took a chance on this one.
Actual rating: 3.5 Initially I was putting off reading this series because I am not huge on the whole cyborg thing. I didnt know if I was going to connect with a cyborg MC and if the whole futuristic setting would do it for me. I normally prefer fantasy. I like my knights. I like my magic. I like my pseudoMedieval setting. With scifi and anything that comes close to it you expect science and technology, which are things I dont particularly care about. The Lunar Chronicles is a strange mix of both: there is magic even though it is closer to the Force, Star Wars style, as a principle instead of your typical fantasy magic and there is technology. Unfortunately or fortunately?, the whole time I was picturing the use of magic like this: As far as reading habits go, I have long learned the lesson that I have to try out new things and sometimes books I have initially dismissed turn out to be quite enjoyable if I give them a chance. So...I gave this book a chance even though only because my local bookstore didnt have anything new and I just picked it up out of ...boredom, I guess. Now, briefly : The things I loved: the setting, the backstory, the fast pacing  Cinder. The things I didnt quite love: Prince Kais overall awesomeness  the fact that the setting was awesome, but the worldbuilding wasnt more detailed because the potential was huge. See? If those aspects of the book were more developed, it would have been one hell of a novel. Everybody loves a snarky, sarcastic heroine, right? At least I do. I prefer them this way to the kindhearted, beautiful and sweetly naive MCs we normally get. However, it is a problem when sarcasm overrides all other reactions and the heroine acts as a spoilt teen. There is a fine line between being funnily sarcastic and spoilt, and Cinder, unfortunately, gravitates between the two states. Not always, but frequently enough to make me notice. The spoilt and unpleasant state is most obvious when it comes to her communication with Dr. Erland: Cinder tilted her head. Dont they pay you enough for corrective eye surgery? I like the way these feel. Dr. Erland dragged the holograph down, revealing the inside of Cinders head. Speaking of eye surgery, do you realize youre missing tear ducts? What? Really? And I thought I was just emotionally withdrawn. She pulled her feet up, hugging her knees. Im also incapable of blushing, if that was going to be your next brilliant observation. On the other hand, when left alone she is quite pleasant and as weird as that sounds, human. Yes, that is one of her most predominant characteristics: being human. I know some people had a problem with this considering she is a cyborg, however it wasnt an issue for me. True, she has some mechanic parts, however, she still is human, her mind, her emotions, everything is human. She is not an android: she was born and raised, felt emotions and built a character. Which in my book makes her human. Of course, everybody is free to interpret this as they like considering we dont really have cyborgs in real life. Particularly for me, I shouldnt have worried about the cyborg part to begin with but you know, pride and prejudice. Another impressive thing is that unlike the original Cinderella, our MC is not an overworked silly bimbo, who just takes every bullshit her stepmother  sisters throw at her. Cinder is overworked, but she realises that she does not deserve the horrible attitude she gets. I do appreciate the fact that we didnt get a Disneystyle heroine at all. Since the book is almost solely focused on Cinder, the rest of the characters  prince Kai, Dr. Erland, Adri, Peony, Pearl, Queen Levana  are not really that developed. True, we get some chapters from prince Kais POV, however they are not enough to help us build a complete image of him as a character. It is a bit onesided  the wellintending, handsome prince who is looking for a way to save his people. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but it would have been nice to get some flaw or some dark secret or ... something not that knightinshiningarmor style. I prefer my heroes grey, not all black and white. The mystery surrounding Cinders origins was quite obvious from page 41 my edition , but somehow this didnt reduce the level of interest I took in the plot. I usually get really pissed off when I read something predictable.I take it as a sign that the author is underestimating hisher readers and their intelligence  along with the quite simple ability to put two and two together. However, in this particular case I think the main emphasis was not on Cinders mysterious background, but more on what role her life would play in the fate of the Earth dramatic music ON from now on. And this makes the predictable part of the plot OK. For me, at least. Now, in regards to the setting and the fact that it wasnt as developed as I would have liked. There was only a brief mention of World War IV and I was left wondering what exactly happened, how the world turned out as it did. I enjoyed the setting very much  the only Asianinspired setting Ive read in a fantasyscifi novel was Daniel Abrahams Long Price Quartet, so I was quite happy with the different outlook we got here. Meyers imagination and creativity  amazing. I really do hope in the other books we will get to experience a closer look on the setting because for the moment it is not as elaborate as I would like it to be. I measure a books qualities not solely on their literary characteristics  if style, voice and narration are properly synchronised, for example  but also based on the effect it emotionally exerts on me. As quite often happens, I realise a book is not masterpiece literature, but it moves me and for me this is a very representative sign of the authors skills. What I have been trying to say is that I would always rate a book higher if it has managed to spark some feelings in me, regardless of whether it was a brilliant piece of literature or not. In Cinders case, both aspects are rated in the middle for me. The book is wellwritten, no doubt, but it wasnt exceptional. It was moving, but not heartbreaking or heartwarming. Still the enjoyment factor was higher than simply I liked it, which is why I have rated it with 3.5, but marked 4 since for me it was in the higher end of the spectre. Overall, I have higher expectations for Scarlet and I hope I will enjoy it. I will certainly read anything Marissa Meyer writes from now on.  Link to Blog 
I have relatively mixed feelings about this book in general, but there is no way I am not reading the second book. In fact, I cant wait for September to come around now. I feel as if this book was supposed to be more of a setup book, but it definitely was interesting while setting the scene for what is to come. Kendare Blake did a wonderful job of creating tension between nearly every character and each other, and I would totally recommend. Is say that theres pretty much a queen for everybody. I personally thought they were all interesting and relatable to for many different reasons, but I was most drawn to Arsinoe. However, I do wish that the chapters were more evenly divided between the queens, because this book seemed to focus mostly on Arsinoe and her friend Jules. Now on to the good spoiler stuff. This book . . . Okay, Im gonna break this down into my feelings for the characters first. ARSINOE: Other than pronouncing her name Arisnoe for the first half of the book, I think she was a relatively solid character. Contradictory at times, but I found her pretty relatable. I found her extremely fierce, and I really enjoyed her friendship with Jules. I did not approve of her use of low magic at all over the course of the story, but I can see why she decided to succumb to what it had to offer. When one is weak, they will go to great lengths to be considered strong. And that is okay. I honestly just thought she needed to find a different strength. She was certainly the most clever of the bunch, so she had that going for her. Until she ruined it for herself. I suppose I should have seen the whole poisoner twist coming, considering. Regardless, the second I read I ate it too, it kind of hit me like a truck and I lay on my bed stuttering for a few minutes before I could function again. But I guess it makes a lot of sense. Kind of kicking myself for not being able to see it. Could any of you see it? Or was that just me being clueless? I thought Billy was a very interesting character, and I love how Arsinoe called him Junior despite his efforts to force her otherwise. I think she likes him, and I like how loyal he is to her. His bold choices to be on her side really stood out to me, but I dont know whether I believe that he wasnt the one to try to poison her yet. Wouldnt that just be the easiest way to gain her trust? At this point, I trust no one. Especially after he PietyrKatharine incident. Nuh uh. Not anymore. MIRABELLA: I personally thought she was one of the sweetest characters in this entire novel. She was so misunderstood. I never really thought much about how everyone expects the strongest to always be the meanest and most coldhearted. No one outside her own little circle of priestesses really knew how sweet Mirabella really was. Well, and Joseph. But Im not here to talk about him. If I were, well . . . watch out. Theres a reason Im not going to discuss his character. That reasons name is Mirabella. ANYWAY. She was so sweet, and I loved how she was the only one who could remember her childhood, before the triplets were all set against each other, back when they could just be sisters. Of course, now because of Arsinoe she is a tad more bloodthirsty and bitter, but I just wish that Arsinoe took a second to hear her out and not conform to the expectation that she has to hate her sisters. KATHARINE: Oh Katharine. I feel as if she got the least amount of story time in this book. I didnt have much of a connection to her because I didnt get to read more than fifteen chapters about her. I definitely wish we got more time to read about her development. That way, maybe Id be able to tell whether or not I think shes a naturalist. You know, since Arsinoe is apparently the poisoner. But if Arsinoe is the poisoner, and she is a naturalist, then Katharine will have gained some advantage because of her poison training. Do you think? I dont know. But maybe that would mean that Sweetheart was her familiar. That would make sense, considering she only ever listened to Kat and never bit her. Despite the fact that she was a venomous snake. Sweetheart, not Katharine. But PIETYR! HOW COULD HE? WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS? I really do not understand who Pietyr thinks he was helping when he pushed her off a cliff. Was he lying when he said he loved her, or was it all an act so he could gain her trust, lure her willingly into his clutches, and then kill her before anyone else got the chance? And to think, halfway through this book I deemed them to be my Three Dark Crowns OTP. I think he was the only character I blindly trusted, and he was the only one I really should not have. Moral of this story: If I were one of these queens, you can bet Id be dead already. I hate how now, even sweet little baby dandelion Katharine is bloodthirsty and angry. Man, we cant trust anyone these days.
Our Dragon doesnt eat the girls he takes, no matter what stories they tell outside our valley. We hear them sometimes, from travelers passing through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice, and he were a real dragon. Of course thats not true: he may be a wizard and immortal, but hes still a man, and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to eat one of us every ten years. This book has spellbound me. Naomi Novik has created a beautiful story, and it ensnared me like The Woods she writes of. But first... I want to start off by stating that I really enjoyed this book. I found it incredibly fun, and incredibly endearing. Overall it was just a really charming fairytale, and it hooked me. That doesnt mean Im blind to its faults, and it does have faults. I went in having read two kinds of reviews with little inbetween. One review being a glowing five star, singing Uprooted all the praises they could think to bestow upon it one review I read even called it a masterpiece. The second kind was a one star review taking about how this was one of the worst novels they had ever read, and how they wished they hadnt wasted their time reading it. I read one angry rant that was quite startling in is clear visceral hatred. So naturally when I began reading I was hesitant as to what I would find and ultimately I think Im one of the rarer people who falls inbetween of the two extreme viewpoints. There was a song in this forest, too, but it was a savage song, whispering of madness and tearing and rage. Firstly you have to remember jumping in that while this book is a fantasy, it is first and foremost a fairytale. The characters arent the very well developed, the magic system is pretty shallow compared to the kinds of magic I read in most fantasies, and the plot is fast I mean really fast I got a bit of whiplash with how quickly things progressed. Im not saying all fairytales are like this, especially nowadays with the more in depth retellings, but in my mind this was an old style fairytale. I found the characters and the magic as thin as they were incredibly fun, so while I could intellectually see the flaws and why some people would be annoyed, I didnt care because I was having to good a time. The unraveled threads of my magic were gradually coiling back into my skin. The magic system, despite lacking in detail, was enchanting HA! See what I did there? Only funny to me? Okay, sorry, moving on..., and the dichotomy between the two different ways of wielding magic, and how it came together was a real payoff, and made up for a lot. Not to mention Noviks beautiful description of characters weaving their spells. Still I found Agnieszka came into her abilities much to rapidly for my taste, and more explanation would have been nice. The use of Jaga Baba Yaga, or the shadow of her really, was well done though I longed for her to appear, and not just lurk between the pages. Though in the end that was probably a more effective way of telling the story, and my wanting is a symptom of the skillful use of this device. He was a thing of books and alembics to me, library and laboratory. Despite having borderline onedimensional characters I found the dimensions they did posses enjoyable. Agnieszka and the Dragons interactions were super fun Im a sucker for love hate relationships, and the banter between the two was great. Some may not like the relationship between the two, but I felt it developed nicely, and surprisingly steadily, considering how hyper fast everything else in the novel moved along. The captorcaptee aspect was dealt with smoothly, so there was not any kind of ick factor in regards to the progression of their relationship. I didnt care a whit about Kasia though. Usually Im all for strong female friendships, but I felt no attachment to Agnieszka and Kasias friendship whatsoever. There isnt much of a basis for the friendship the reader is just kind of told theyre best friends, but the reasons for it are simply not shown. And more to the point, I found Kasia boring and wanted her out of the way. Characters who are written to be perfect are probably my biggest pet peeve, and while Kasia did not send me into a rage as some other characters have made me before, I couldnt make myself like her either. I was just ambivalent towards her longing for her to get out of the way, or at least have the decency to develop a few flaws if she was so determined to stick around. Agnieszka to has a bit of the same problem as Kasia. Its not that Agnieszka is perfect its that she has a serious case of being the special one. It didnt become annoying until abut halfway through the novel when I just felt she had become far to special, far to different, to be believable, and it quite honestly took some of the enjoyment away from me. I think my breaking point was when Agnieszka was being tested by the other witches and wizards and showed off just how truly different as special she was, and while it took her only a few months to become a qualified witch, it took most others seven years. Then I nearly laughed out loud when she was going to receive her name, but she was so different and unique, and she didnt get one. I just could not help but roll my eyes at that. There is such a thing as being too exceptional. And no, her clumsiness does not make up for it in the least. In fact I found it unpleasantly reminiscent of Bella Swan. I wanted to rub handprints through his dust. The fast paced plot was jarring to me at times. I would have appreciated more quiet moments, more introspection but perhaps that is just me trying to make the novel into something it was never meant to be. The concept of The Woods was a great one, and did not just add to the atmosphere of the fairytale, but was a unique antagonist, that could have been cheesy if written poorly, but in this case felt like an honest threat. All in all I would highly recommend this book, despite its faults. Its a lighthearted, fairytale romp but if you go in expecting Catherynne M. Valente you are going to be disappointed. Think more Howls Moving Castle, which I believe is a fairly apt comparison, though in truth I would have to say Howls Moving Castle is the superior of the two. But really, despite the criticisms I gave, I truly enjoyed Uprooted. I was completely enamored, and liked it enough to go out and buy a hard copy despite the fact that I bought it initially as an eBook. I also created a Pinterest mood board for Uprooted because I was so taken by the story. EDIT: I originally rated this 3 stars and only recently after a little less then a year bumped it up to four stars, though I have not reread it. I have the tendency to nitpick a novel as I gain more distance from it, and will inevitably find flaws in it I had not noticed upon reading it for the first time. The opposite seems to have occurred with Uprooted. While I still stand by my criticisms, I really do look on this book fondly, and highly enjoyed it. Ive softened to it as time goes by, and since I still have not quite gotten it out of my head I decided to make my review four stars.
Original post at One More Page Ive heard a lot of good reviews for this book from various book blogs and book friends, but I never picked it up because I wasnt into dystopia back then. In fact, I saw a copy of this book a couple of times in Fully Booked but I always ignored it. No time to read it, I always think. After some really strong recommendations, I finally got a sample from Amazon and read the first few pages, thinking that if I really want it, I can always get the Kindle edition. But as I read on, I knew only one thing: I MUST HAVE THIS BOOK. Not the ebook, but the actual print book, because there are parts of the book that just looks better in print. Unfortunately, on the day I decided I wanted the book, the only copy in the Fully Booked branch nearest my office was gone. : My friend Jana, who also wanted the book, got to the last copy first, so I would have to wait. grumble Thanks to the wonderful people of Fully Booked, though, for transferring a copy to Eastwood a week after I inquired to them about it. Of course, I wasnt able to read this immediately, and it wasnt until about a month from when I got this that I got to read it. You can never go wrong with a book that starts with a talking dog, especially one that says, Poo, poo. The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness starts this way: The first thing you find out when yer dog learns to talk is that dogs dont got nothing much to say. About anything. Need a poo, Todd. I must do a Russell from Up impression here: BUT ITS A TALKING DOG! : From that moment on, I knew that even if I didnt like the book in the end, Id still be fond of the talking dog. I really wasnt sure what to expect as I read this book because I stayed away from as many spoilers as possible, so I plunged into the book knowing only the basic stuff: Todd is the last boy in Prentisstown, where only men live and everyone can hear the other persons thoughts. Then he discovers a hole in the noise, complete silence that is impossible in the world he grew up in. Todd is then made to run far, far away from Prentisstown for reasons he couldnt understand, which leads to a chase to a world outside he thought never existed. It took me a while to really get into the book, despite the talking dog, because of the way Todd talks. The Knife of Never Letting Go is written in Todds point of view, and growing up in the New World has given Todd a different way of talking, which may be because of the deterioration of education in Prentisstown since the boys dont go to school nor read. Most of narration becomes Todds actual thoughts, most of which spill over each other and sometimes goes on and on without periods that I ran out of breath while reading it even if I was doing so silently. The language is reminiscent of The Strawberry Girl by Lois Lenski, but more rough and raw as I wasnt just seeing things happen, but feeling them since I had access to Todds thoughts and whoevers Noise he can hear. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but when I did, the book gripped me and refused to let go. Patrick Ness is one heck of a writer, and I admire him for never being afraid of hurting his characters. As a wannabe novelist, I always have problems with hurting my characters because theyve grown close to my heart as I write them, and hurting them feels like Im hurting myself. If youre that type of reader who grows attached to characters they read and hate it when they get hurt...well, be prepared because Ness can be pretty ruthless. I always get a sense of dread whenever Todd would end up content and somewhat happy in one place because I know the author is just preparing to bring out another big gun that would send Todd and his companions running. Its not bad, of course, but rather very effective because it kept me reading, rooting for Todd and wanting him to win it in the very end. The action scenes were satisfying, the running and the panic felt very real, and Ness kept the mystery of Todds history kept very well up until the revelation point, and he didnt reveal everything so much that all questions were answered. Its not just senseless action or violence, either. Every action and everything that Todd does has a bearing in the end, one that helped him grow as needed at the climax of the novel. Todds realizations is not only applicable in his world, but also in our world and in how we strive to get something we want or to be someone we want to be. I find this quote from the book very true emphasis mine, and dont worry, no spoilers: Heres what I think, I say and my voice is stronger and thoughts are coming, thoughts that trickle into my noise like whispers of truth. I think maybe everybody falls, I say. I think maybe we all do. And I dont think thats the asking...I think the asking is whether we get back up again. The Knife of Never Letting Go truly lives up to its hype. Im lucky that I read this now because I dont think I could have waited so long to read the next book because the ending is just...well, Id leave it to you to find out. And I must warn you as well: there may be a part when youd want to stop reading the book and mull over what happened a bit, and maybe even shed a few tears. I did that. :P I cant wait to start reading the next book, The Ask and the Answer , which I am reserving for the YAD2 reading challenge. The Knife of Never Letting Go is a dark, fastpaced and actionpacked dystopian novel that will surely have you at the edge of your seat. If you see this in the bookstore, dont think twice: just get it and read. I promise you wont regret it.
As this is the fifth book, there will most likely be spoilers in this review. When I first started this book, I knew it was going to be intense. I just wasnt expecting it to be as intense as it was. There was so much going on, so much that happened, and my mind was reeling after reading it, trying to comprehend everything that happened, everything that is to come, and so much more. And to be quite frank: I absolutely enjoyed it. I found that the plot followed a steady stream from where it left off in Queen of Shadows and took a lot more darker turns, a lot more sexual turns, and showed a lot more teamwork, friendship, and hardship. It was one that I found to be full of action  and a lot more devastating action than before. There were heartbreaks and upsets, but there was also hidden joys and bits of happiness that could also be found. So lets take a look into the characters, shall we? Aelin continues to grow stronger in her magic in this book, which I highly appreciate given I wanted more after the last two books from when she really started to hone her skills into the Fire Wielder she is now. Holy crap, shes powerful, and at times I felt like she was too powerful, but I was also glad to see that even her magic has limits, that even she is susceptible to burnouts, and that she needs to replenish her magic just like all of the others who have magic have to, too. I found Aelin to be more arrogant in this book, even if it was a front sometimes, but I also found her to be more unwilling to share any sort of plans with her comrades. I felt that that was where her downfall was, because then maybe some certain events could have been prevented more, but at the same time, probably not. Despite having so much arrogance, its not that Aelin doesnt trust her friends with things she does tell Lysandra some things, but its that she feels that if her plans fail that her friends will hate her for it  again, another character flaw, but one that was well done, in my opinion, because her friends got that and understood it even if they did get a bit mad afterward. She was such a strong, kickass version of herself in this installment, and I need to know what happens to her next because she just got into a lot of shit at the end there. Oh man. Rowan was ever the protective Fae male warrior who definitely lusted after Aelin a lot, but as those scenes between then grew and grew until they practically burst, I found that I was growing to like it more and more. Even if it was a bit much sometimes. Its not that I didnt enjoy what went on between them, but I feel like we lost a bit of the warrior Rowan we saw in Heir of Fire in these last two books. I mean, he still kicks ass and hes still fierce, and willing to take down a whole arming of ilking if the need arose, but I wanted more of that stern, snarky warrior we once had before. Manon. Oh, my ever loving heart, Manon. She was phenomenal. She was still cool and calculating, ready to rip peoples throats out, but I saw that humanity in her, the one she thought didnt exist, especially when it came to a brutal decision that was forced upon her and her Thirteen. When she stood up to her grandmother, you bet I was cheering for her. Shes powerful and strong, and cunning, and I love that even though she says she doesnt need anyone, she really does. I dont know if shes truly realized that yet, but shes definitely a powerful force to be reckoned with and Im really interested to see how she goes about accepting her bloodline, what will happen next, and if there will be any resolve as a result of it. ELIDE. FREAKING. LOCHAN. Where the hell were you hiding, girl!? Elide definitely grew on me in the last book, but in this one? Oh, she has my whole heart now, because she just showed so much growth and strength and heart, and I thought that she was just incredible in this book. Not only did she set out on her journey to find Aelin, to do what she could for her queen, but she also showed that shes not this frail little thing, but she has a fighting spirit. I loved her time spent with Lorcan, strained though it was, and I thought that the two were two sides of the same coin in ways. We got to learn more about her, how she uses her cunning to get through many situations, and that shes willing to risk a lot for those she cares about. I need more of her in my life. Now. Speaking of Lorcan, I love him. And yes, Im totally 100 shipping him and Elide together. Even though he was kind of a jerk at the end and all of that, I want them to be together. He was very hard to crack at the beginning, very serious and hellbent on completing whatever mission he had set out to complete, but as time progressed alongside Elide, I thought that he softened a bit and slowly came to realize that there is more to life than fighting and death and destruction. I think hell really try to atone for his mistakes in the next book for sure. Dorian was so cool in this book no pun intended. He really got a hold over his magic and I thought that he did really well in learning just what that magic held. He was still kind of a lost puppy at the beginning, but he still proved that he was worth something as the book progressed, and that he was still hurting when a certain scene happened that I feel didnt really need to happen, but there it was because ohmygodthatsexualtension. Anyway, I thought that Dorian was strong in ways even he didnt realize, and I really appreciated that. Aedion and Lysandra just need to get together already. Both of them proved how strong they are in different ways and how far theyre both willing to go for their companions. I found that Aedion was just as protective and hot headed as ever, and that Lysandra was really a cool calm before the storm. They really mixed well and balance each other out nicely, thats for sure. I love how much potential each of them holds and am anxious to see more of what theyll have to show in the next book. As for the rest that happened? Oh, where do I even begin? There was so much more added to the story, and bits and pieces of the story from before we even knew certain characters that was shown and unfurled as the plot progressed. I loved seeing a lot of it and felt that it wasnt too much or overbearing, but just what the characters needed in that time. Also, can we talk about Erawan and Maeve? I seriously feel like theyre conspiring together, but both of them are so good at hiding things from everyone around them, I cant be sure that thats actually true. And I really dont like Maeve. At all. ALSO, all of those characters that came back from the novellas!? I loved that! Seeing Rolfe, Ansel, and the others was just so, so awesome and I hope that they play a bigger role in the next book. There were just a few things that nagged me and bugged me that happened in the book that is causing this to not be a full five star read for me, and that is the amount of sex scenes in the book. I mean, Im all for a good sex scene and it being a positive experience for the characters and all that, but I felt like there was just too much of it going on amidst the chaos of the rest of the book. Maybe it was to break up the tension, but maybe it could have been done in different ways. Like, every other character pairing wanted to get into each others pants. Chill your hormones. Im very interested to see what happens in the last book insert sobbing here because there is going to be a LOT of action, a LOT of heartbreak, and I can already feel my heart sobbing in many different ways. I rate this book 4.755 stars and highly recommend it if youve read the rest of the series.
I am absolutely stupefied by this book. After sitting here for a good few minutes trying to think up a proper commencement for this review, I have simply given up. So here we go, on a ride thats hopefully as wild as Maas delivers in her A Court of Mist and Fury. If youre involved in the bookstagram community at all find me greyzonebooks and lets connect! youre aware of this book. Youre probably also aware that everyone thinks its better than the first one, which is quite a rare accomplishment in the book world. This was the first time I wrote down my thoughts in my bullet journal while reading, so were going to walk through each harrowed note step by step. Spoiler line commences here. Usually I can write professional, removed reviews without spoilers but this will just be a listgushchatscream fest. 1. Tamlin is a boring love interest with an interesting story Now that Ive finished the book, this cracks me up a little bit for obvious reasons. During the first novel, Tamlin and I were fine. I didnt love him, but I sure didnt have a problem with him. If Feyre wanted to sacrifice herself for him, it was cool, whatever. But in the beginning of ACOMAF, I quickly grew bored with him. His background was interesting enough, but he was like a Flat Stanley whose claim to fame was merely all of the cool countries he had visited. Good riddance, Im so thankful for Rhysand. 2. Convenient sexy situations I could probably write a separate post only outlining the ohsoconvenienttensionbuildingsexyscenes in this novel. And you know what? I loved it. I ate it up. I am a huge hater of cheese and lazy convenience, but this interested me for some reason. Maas is one of those authors with the Xfactor that makes reviewers drive themselves off a bridge trying to pin down any thoughts. You know those cliches, where the couple isnt together but youre supposed to ship them nonetheless, and they keep ending up...in convenient sexy situations. Part of the deal is you dancing around in sexy clothing pretending to be my prostitute can we avoid the wword in this review? We shall see? Great. Oh, there only happens to be one bed in our hotel room where we ordered two? Fabulous. Oh, we have to pretend to be madly and love and attracted to each other, practically going at it in front of a crowd, all for show? Perfect. Its a little much. In any other book it would be too much. But somehow it works at effectively building tension. 3. Real first loves Remember that spoiler line? You are under it. Proceed at your own risk. Feyre loved Tamlin. Obviously, as she was willing to sacrifice her whole life and sanity for him. However, he was her first love. She bravely stepped apart from the masses of typical YANA heroines and left him for someone better fitting. Its organic, its natural, its human, and I wish it didnt take faes for more authors to pick up on this when they have more than one book in a series. 4. Speaking of New Adult... This is not YA. I repeat, this is not YA. There may be fantasy, this may appear to be for any old teenage, it may even be shelved as YA. It is not. The characters most definitely seem like adults, not teens, and here is your solitary content warning. It took a bit of strategy to read this book in school. Proceed at your own risk. 5. Pacing and War If youve followed my reading for a while, you know that I am not a lover of epic fantasies. I dont like weird names, fake monsters, unique lore, etc etc etc. There is quite a bit of that in ACOMAF. I could deal with it because the writing and characters were so good, but the war ? and other purely plotbased themes went straight over my head. I just couldnt focus on it. I would find myself reading four pages in a sitting. And then one part where that chilled for a little bit, I read two hundred pages in twentyfour hours. Two hundred. That does not happen for me. Maas is a master storyteller. 6. Faes are Us We all know this is fantasy. Everyone has weird powers, this book has nothing to do with our world. But with this, Feyre comes across as a very real person. Shes authentic, fresh, and just what we need in this industry. 7. TENSION TENSION TENSION Have I said that Maas is a master of tension yet? Because she is. An absolute master. One bit of writing advice for romance that I always see is allowing feelings to develop naturally over tie, never to force it, until the reader is desperate for them to finally come together. Maas heeded this advice. I felt the torment myself. 8. Oh, that makes sense now In case Maas needed more writing devices to master, she is also flawless at introducing details that are crucial later. She thinks these through and executes it well. This lady is most certainly not a pantser. I would give up one of my favorite fountain pens to see how this woman maps out her novels. 9. However... For as successful as she is at 8, there were a few aspects that were a little too convenient. Particularly whats revealed in that one random Rhys chapter Im still not sure what the purpose of that was. 10. Abusive relationships Returning to realistic relationships here...I love how Maas played out Feyre leaving Tamlin. While she was with him in the first book, she loved him. Neither her nor us readers expected that anything was amiss. How abusive and horrible he actually was to her is slowly revealed throughout the second novel, and it all starts to click. For someone who experienced a boyfriendgoneamiss, this was handled tenderly, expertly, and effectively 11. Master of the Ending Again, I have a new crown for Maas. Man, does this lady know how to hammer out those endings. Both this and ACOTAR rallied in at the end and delivered a heartstopping climax right before the last few pages. I actually love her strategy of saying screw it to the falling action and going out with a bang. Well done. 12. My poor heart I know somethings good when I physically react. There were multiple occasions where I had to stop reading, grip my heart, and try to regain composure in a public setting. Well done. 13. Feminist text Feyres character arc is a genuine, raw, beautiful masterpiece. Her journey can most certainly be taken as a feminist one while she finds herself and her place as the High Lady of the night court. I adored how her lover could still exert his cocky maleness Maas just loves saying the male instead of the man, I dont know either over her, and still allow herself to be her own ruler and make her own choices. It was deliberate, it was beautiful, and I cherished it. Well done. Can I add well done to the end of every single point? I hope you enjoyed my attempt at collecting my eclectic thoughts here. Please, lets talk! Send me the lengthiest comment you can make and I will return it with fervor. One last time  well done, Maas.
4.5 stars For anyone who, as it happened to me, is having trouble getting into this book  stick with it! I promise it gets much, much better! Lilac LaRoux is the daughter of the richest man in the known universe, Tarver Merendsen is a lower class young man who, due to his feats in the battlefield, was quickly promoted to major, thus outranking most of the officers on the luxury spaceliner in which Lilac and Tarver are travelling. Something goes wrong with the spaceliner and, after getting into an escape pod, Lilac and Tarver crash into a strange planet. Its not just about surviving in the wilderness and trying to flag a spaceship to rescue them  its about cracking the mystery of the whispers that haunt them in this new planet. I didnt really like the way this book started, this book could have been worthy of 5 stars, but the start... I read many complaints about finding Lilac unlikable at first, I didnt have that problem, my problem is that the beginning of the book makes the characters sound like a standard YA MarySue and GaryStue. Get this: Lilac is a gorgeous redhead, rich, famous, and among a sea of flawlessly gorgeous women she stands out. Not only that, shes a genius in electronics, explosives, and space travel. Tarver is only 18 years old but he is so amazing that, even in an extremely classist society, he managed to be promoted above all the rich people in the military and now outranks everyone on the spaceship. Not only that he is also super handsome and fit, and he is now famous for his battle heroics. I mean... really? But I urge readers to ignore this inauspicious start. The story is well worth it. First of all, hurray for a healthy relationship in YA!! The guy is so normal! Yeah, he still notices and thinks about sex, but he respects her and, thinking his advances will not be welcome, does not attempt anything. Which, given the circumstances would have been a bit iffy  I mean, theyre stranded in a strange planet, she depends on him for survival... The romance part of the book was masterfully dealt with. Lilac had a say in all of it, the matter of consent was very present in all their romantic interactions. Plus it wasnt a case of instalove; they started off on the wrong foot and learned to trust and eventually like each other. It was a gradual and realistic buildup, especially considering their circumstances. The story is told in alternating POVs, we get Lilac, we get Tarver, and we get glimpses of Tarvers interrogation after their rescue, which help frame the chapters that follow them and keep the reader guessing as to what actually happened until the very end. I really liked both characters despite their unrealistic achievements. They were both so likable that I, a notoriously picky reader, managed to just go, Yeah... Ill just ignore it because aww look at them! I loved Lilac. She crashes into a planet while wearing a ball gown and high heels and not once complains about trekking through the wilderness. She tries to keep up with Tarver no matter what, even if its clear hed be willing to give her a break, because as she puts it: ... years later, when he looks back at this escapade, Id rather he think bitch than weakling. Yes! Girl, tell it!!! She is not, despite her introduction, a MarySue in the way she behaves throughout the book. She recognises her failings, she knows her limits, she also knows when not to back down. And she was never tstl. Do you know how refreshing it is to read a YA female protagonist like that? Tarver is also great. Instead of being the usual manipulative, controlling asshole that populates most YA, New Adult and Contemporary Romance books, hes gasp a normal guy, who thinks of Lilac as an equal human being  just one he happens to be attracted to, but given everything, that is hardly of importance, not when theyre struggling to survive. He understands that Lilacs need for independence is not just a feminine whim hell condescendingly indulge or not, as many male characters in his place would have seen it  but a core element of her selfworth and ability to keep going in a dreadful situation. He was very capable and, inarguably, the one most at ease in their environment, but he never took that as meaning he was the one in charge. The great thing about Lilac and Tarvers relationship was the mutual respect and the slow build of trust between them. They asked multiple times throughout the book for the other ones trust and that was the basis for their whole relationship. That is so awesome! This is not just a survival tale, there is a mystery to be cracked in this planet: whispers and visions haunt them through their trek. Things happen that make them doubt their sanity. There is something... someone there with them. But who or what could it be? Not going to spoil it, of course, but I have to say that readers should prepare themselves for some tearjerking moments that come out of nowhere and punch them in the gut, then leave them sobbing and gasping while contemplating the nature of self and what makes a person who they are, and how consciousness and selfawareness may not be enough to make you real. Basically a Descartes beatdown, but its the reader that ends up curled into a ball, crying. I honestly cannot wait to get my hands on the next book  even though I already know it wont be about Lilac and Tarvers, though hopefully theyll make an appearance, or at the very least will be mentioned in it. But I trust Amie Kaufman and Maegan Spooner to write a wonderful book  all my respect to them: two authors writing a book and it reads absolutely seamlessly, and they wrote an incredibly engaging plot with a healthy relationship within it. Really, really well done! Anyway, I dont know how convincing I managed to be, since my aim is to get everyone to read this book, so just in case I wasnt very successful: PLEASE GO READ THIS BOOK! I promise youll love it!
Overall rating: 3.55 THE KEEPER: 35 I didnt really get much out of this one, since it was stuff we already knew about, but it was kinda cool to get a bit more backstory on Scarlets grandma and her time spent hiding Selenes body. Mostly it just gave us insight into how Cinder was named. Not much else I can say about it! Cinders. Embers. Ashes. Michelle hoped that whatever strength had allowed the child to survive the fire all those years ago was a strength that still burned inside her. That it would go on burning, hotter and hotter, until she was as bright as the rising sun. GLITCHES: 35 Again, this one didnt really do much for me. Neat little backstory, with some insight into how Cinder felt as a child coming to her new family. And fixing Iko, yay! And of course, Adri is a raging bitch. But we already knew that. THE QUEENS ARMY: 3.55 I liked this one a little better, because Wolf was always one of my favorite characters, and I feel like we never really got that much background on him and the events that led to his being Alpha. The story showed us that hes certainly no hero  theres blood on his hands, and he doesnt balk at killing when necessary. It also showed us that Brock was a douche. CARSWELLS GUIDE TO BEING LUCKY: 3.55 I rather liked this story! I always liked Thorne, mostly for his humor. And this short story had plenty of that! I must say that it made me dislike Thorne just a little bit, though, because hes such a hopeless womanizer. Charming, sure, but kind of...manipulative. Selfish. It was pretty adorable that he stood up for Kate, though! He had wondered why she liked books so much, and if it had anything to do with why he liked spaceships. Because they could take you somewhere far, far away from here. AFTER SUNSHINE PASSES BY: 2.55 Cresss story was kind of depressing, in a way. Theres really not much to it, just Cress getting locked away for the rest of her childhood, which we knew. I suppose there is a certain amount of emotion to the story, but I felt it kind of unnecessary. Filler. We already knew what happened to Cress, and why, and I didnt feel like this one added anything else to that. It felt like a deleted scene  and deleted scenes are deleted for a reason. THE PRINCESS AND THE GUARD: 45 I feel like Winters story was the most meaningful, because it gives us insight as to why she chose to refuse her Lunar gift. Or was that in the main series? I dont remember it at all, if it was... This story actually made me like and respect Winter as a character a lot. Shes viewed as weak by the Lunars because she cant doesnt use her gift, but I was impressed by how strong she was. Even when Levana was manipulating her into holding a knife to her own throat, Winter didnt back down. She stayed true to herself and refused to use her gift, no matter what. I loved that! I loved that she stuck to her guns. It has to be this way. I will accept this side effect. I will accept any amount of monsters my mind wants to give me, but I will not become a monster myself. It was also cute to experience the moment when Winter realized she loved Jacin, and to see the dynamic between them as they grew closer together. THE LITTLE ANDROID: 45 Jeez, talk about depressing! I mean, I think this has been my favorite so far, but damn. I love that this is an original story, not an addon or deleted scene. I kind of loved seeing Stars story, how she wasnt just a mindless android, how she saved Datarans life and fell for him. Her brief but meaningful run in with Cinder. But, like I said, it was pretty depressing. This story is based off of the original story of The Little Mermaid. If you know it, youd know that it is nothing like Disneys version. Hence the depressingness. She would tell him that she was the one who had saved his life, because something about him made her unpredictable, and maybe dangerous, and she couldnt exist in a world without him. That ending?!?! Im confused. Did they switch bodies?? Then how would Dataran have recognized Miko? But how else would Mikos father not have known something was up? What was the meaning of Star having her skin graft pulled back so that Mikos father would see it? Did they switch skin? But no, she was dying because of a compatibility issue, so it had to be a body that wasnt hers. I DONT GET IT GUYS. THE MECHANIC: 35 This was kind of pointless too  the scene where Kai and Cinder first met, only in Kais point of view. I mean, his thoughts and impressions of her were totally adorable, but it didnt really add much to the story because weve already seen it. He was optimistic as he left the weekly market behind. More optimistic than he had been in weeks. That mechanic was going to change everything. SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW: 4.55 This was by FAR my favorite story of them all, and honestly the only reason I picked this book up in the first place. Because when I heard talk of a marriage, I knew it was going to be my favorite couple of the series getting married. AND IT WAS SO ADORABLE, YOU GUYS. I absolutely loved it, and it gave me all the feels! I totally freaking loved that all of the girls set up a surprise wedding in the house and tricked Scarlet into getting ready for it, to keep it private like she really wanted. SO. BEAUTIFUL. Wolf smiled around his canine teeth. You are the most beautiful sight I have ever laid eyes on. Oh dont mind me, I just have an eyelash or something stuck in my eye....

Actual Rating 2.5 This review has also been posted on The Social Potato One thing I did learn from this book was that making your readers feel intense emotions isnt always going to help them like a book, because while I definitely felt the intensity of the emotions the author tried to convey, I never fell in love with it. There were certain scenes that really got to me but never really changed how I felt about it. I must say, though, while I didnt enjoy The Things You Kiss Goodbye very much, I think this is the kind of book that would be perfect in the hands of the right readers. The blurb promises a story that deals with the effects of an abusive relationship and I dont think the book dealt with that issue nearly as well as it could have. In fact, throughout the book, the issue was rarely dealt with. Bettina has an abusive boyfriend, but even his abusiveness was downplayed in the way Bettina thought about it. She was bothered by it, but it never set off any alarms for her, which to ME was alarming. The readers could tell the change their relationship had taken, yet Bettina took the blame and said she wasnt trying hard enough. To escape the relationship, she didnt break up with him. She acknowledged that the relationship was doomed but she didnt break up with him and instead ran into the arms of another guy Ill get back to that bit. When she found out that Brady might have also been cheating on her, she STILL didnt do anything and that just didnt make sense to me. I KNOW that abusive relationships are a complicated thing and I wont even try to claim I understand them, but to me as a reader, the fact that Bettina did nothing about the relationship didnt bode well. I couldnt wrap my head around this. Bettina was also a difficult character for me to get behind. She is an artist, a dancer, and has a greek heritage so she definitely has the makings of an interesting character, but somewhere along the way I stopped liking her. I never hated or even disliked her; I just wasnt enthusiastic about her. She seemed so desperate to get out of her house because she felt her father suffocated her that she lost sight of what really mattered. She didnt care if getting out didnt actually make her any happier which is evident from some of the incidents that took place, she seemed to want to get out just to get out. She had a great relationship with her brothers going, but this negative portrayal of her father really bothered me. Her parents are apparently not proud of her and I sensed some favoritism too. Plus she seems to miss the most obvious things about her family. I also found it weird how she constantly sees her father as a bad guy but not Brady when Brady, as anyone can see, is a douche bag. On the topic of Brady, I really didnt understand him. He was all nice at first and then turned into an asshole because he became popular? REALLY? Yeah, that didnt work out too well for me, either. The romance itself was another issue. I really couldnt wrap my mind around the difference between their ages. I mean, the author portrayed it well enough that you didnt notice it, but that was also an issue. I mean what does it say about the characters when both of them seem like they are the same age? Add to that the slow burn romance also didnt work. It was really slow burn and under any other circumstances I would have liked it, but... in the end, when the I love yous came, it made no sense to me since they really didnt seem to know each other well. There were some scenes, but I cannot think of one decent conversation they had where they really got to know each other well aside from their pasts. This could also be the result of the narrative technique the author used where it was more of a retelling of the past but it did make it hard to get behind not just their romance but the story the author was trying to sell to us, one where the main character grows as a result of tragic circumstances. In all honesty though, I didnt see much growth in Bettina. She seemed almost exactly the same way as she was in the beginning aside from that fact that she would probably always carry the aftermath of the tragedy in her heart. The tragedy did not come as a surprise to me, but boy did it hurt. It really twisted my heart and I have to say the author wrote those scenes beautifully. I felt the grief rolling off the main character and I felt myself drowning in those emotions. In spite of the intensity of my emotions I could barely breathe, the book couldnt be redeemed for me because sometimes feeling intense emotions isnt enough. Another thing the author should get kudos for are the great relationships amongst friends. The main character didnt have friends at the beginning of the book, but she finds some along the way. Her friends however werent the highlight of this book for me, Regina was. Regina is Tonys grandmother and she is such a great secondary character. You cannot help but love her. She is funny and she is supportive of Bettina and what else can one ask for in a secondary character? With that said, I also had issues with the ending. It just seemed too neat to me. I felt like there were so many things that could have been talked about and some relationships even could have been explored as a result of the tragedy but they werent. This was just the kind of book I was glad to be done with and while I didnt like it, I know there are people out there who will love it. Id recommend this to anyone who wants to read something more emotional dont get tricked by the pretty cover this book is NOT happy.
Well, then. This is the first book I read by Liane Moriarty, but it probably wont be the last. What a rollercoaster ride this was. Let me provide you with a quick overview of how I felt while reading this book. 0  10: this writing style takes some getting used to. Its bizarre, somehow. 10  20: ha! This is like a modern version of Clueless. They want to adopt poor little Jane. Fun fact: I adore the movie Clueless. 20  60: I dont know if I like this. Its a really good book, but I may have to give it a low rating because in spite of it being great, this is one of those stories that make me uncomfortable. 60  80: its so vastly entertaining though. Im watching a trainwreck thats about to happen. 80  90: lol its 2am. Who needs sleep? Okay, okay, its past 2am and I have to get up in 4 hours. Ill go to sleep. After this chapter. 90  100: this book could just as easily have been called Desperate Housewives. Its insane. As you can see, I was leaning towards a lower rating at first. But you know why so many parts of the story made me uncomfortable? Because I cared and I just dont handle characters being treated unfairly very well. This book is simultaneously so, so funny...but also completely horrifying. I mean, this is one of the scariest things Ive probably ever read. Not scary in the traditional thriller sort of way, just scary as in the fact that gossip and backtalk and all that could very well lead to dramas, because theres nothing that gets twisted and turned and spreads like wildfire like a juicy piece of gossip. These women. Let me tell you about these women. I almost wrote The Crackpots and these women because I have been feeling SO nostalgic for The West Wing, its not even funny. Anyone else? No? Just me? Alright, then. The mothers in this book are a force to be reckoned with, each and every one of them. Coincidentally, I heard an interview on the radio just this afternoon with a teacher, who mentioned that parents these days have become a lot more meddlesome, hovering and involved with their kids school lives. And throughout reading this book, Id been thinking about how it does such a good job of showing how much being a teacher has changed in recent years. At the risk of sounding like a grandma, I often hear people comment on the fact that back in the day, when I was still in kindergarten or primary school, when you were punished or had to write lines after misbehaving, the parents never questioned the punishment. Now, however, teachers have to take so much crap from parents who are up in arms the second their child is said to have misbehaved in class. They question the teachers competence, even, because theres no way their precious little angle couldve possibly done something wrong. The crazy thing is that while this is a fictional story, I actually do know some mothers in real life who would behave exactly like this where their children are concerned. Its deplorable, really. Anyway. I tend to ramble completely inarticulately about books that affect me so much. I didnt know much about this going in, and I honestly believe thats the best way to read it. Some chapters  especially the first few ones  almost read as a cautionary tale. 101 reasons why you should not have kids. But the characters have depth and they each become real people the further you get along. There are a lot of funny moments, too, particularly between Madeline and Ed; the kind of moments that I imagine to be daily business for most longtimemarried couples. The kind of moments that make you smile because they feel incredibly real and its easy to relate to them or some variation of them. The book starts off with the start of a murder investigation. You dont know whose murder and you have no idea what happened, so then it flashes back to months before and slowly starts telling its story. The inclusion of people narrating certain events at the start and end of each chapter worked remarkably well here. And now a few observations under a spoiler cut. Do NOT click the spoiler cut if you plan on ever reading this. Trust me. The thing is, I had a gut feeling that Perry would turn out to be Ziggys father. I dont know why, but I just knew. Then when we found out it was actually his cousin, I laughed at myself thinking There you went, thinking you had it all figured out. At least I was close. BUT HEY GUESS WHAT. TURNS OUT IT WAS PERRY, USING HIS COUSINS NAME. BOOM. I WIN. Even after we learned it was Perrys cousin, there was still a seed of doubt in my mind, pondering whether Perry might have used his cousins name for his seedy affairs. I NEVER thought Id turn out to be right, but there you go. So it was a bit of a disappointment that Id unwittingly figured out the major plot twist well ahead of time. The author did such a great job of portraying Perry, though. The scene with him and Celeste sitting in their car, talking about the fact that she is planning on leaving is powerful and since Id been thrown offtrack and wasnt 100 sure anymore that he was the one who hurt Jane, I actually felt somewhat bad for him when he sat in the car sobbing. I fell for what the author was doing hook, line and sinker. It was kind of awesome. Also, speaking of things I called. I totally knew Tom wouldnt be gay. Saw that coming a mile way, and loved it. Is it chicklit? Yes. Is it clearly meant to spark some heavy discussions in book clubs around the world? Definitely. But you know what, I didnt even care that I saw certain important things coming and figured it out. And that says a lot. I went along for the ride and ended up enjoying the heck out of this, which I hadnt been expecting at all.
Check out this review and more at  4.5 Stars THE STORY: Becca: After each CoHo novel that I read, I have a moment of reflection immediately after finishing. I need the time to think about the story from start to finish, every moment that broke my heart and every moment that put it back together. It is no surprise that November 9 gave me all the feels of each CoHo book before it. Even a week after finishing it I still am reeling from all of the emotions! Fallon love that name! has big plans to move from LA across the country to NYC, on the day she is scheduled to move she meets Ben and the two form an instant connection. They spend her last day in LA together and she learns that Ben is in college and wants to be a writer. After meeting Fallon, Ben finally has something to write about. After their one amazing day together, they go on to lead separate lives, but meet up every year on the same day yup you guessed  November 9th : in the same place. Until Fallon learns some things about Ben and begins to question what is real and what is Fiction. Youll never be able to find yourself if youre lost in someone else. Lisa: Just like Becca, Im a HUGE CoHo fan. And though her books arent necessary perfect and without issue, they always bring out the feels. ALL the feels! Her emotional stories combined with her deep and complex characters never disappoint. Fallon suffered a traumatic event that left her scarred both inside and out. Her lack of family support in LA is helping to encourage her move to NYC where she is hoping to tackle her dream of being a movie star. She didnt expect to meet Ben, and she definitely didnt expect to feel what she felt for him after only spending those few hours together. But their connection was undeniable, which brought about their November 9 pact. Im such a sucker for romanticcomedies, so the thought of this left me all kinds of giggly inside. THE CHARACTERS: Lisa: Fallon and Bens story was impossible not to love. Their relationship from the start was filled with witty banter, emotions, and the realness we all hope for in romance stories. Neither character was perfect, both holding back on sharing their secrets with the other. And trust me... they had secrets! But the chemistry and bond between the two was undeniable! Even after a year without seeing each other, the November 9 meetups were so powerful and filled with emotion, humor and, of course, love. When you find love, you take it. You grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go. You cant just walk away from it and expect it to linger until youre ready for it. Fallon was such a strong person, yet after suffering such a horrific event she was left stuck inside her shell, unable to truly be herself any longer. She also didnt have the support system she so needed while going through this time in her life. Thank goodness for her BFF, who helped her get through each day. Ben was a bit of an enigma for most of the story. He was definitely hiding things, but not knowing what they were kept me at arms length. I loved how powerful he felt about Fallon, and how he wasnt afraid to show his interest in her from the start. I also liked how headstrong, determined and forgiving he was. Overall, an extremely swoonworthy guy in my opinion! Becca: I felt the same as Lisa about Ben, I liked him a lot but could definitely tell that he was holding something back. I really kept wondering what he was hiding, especially when we meet his family and they know all about this past that the reader doesnt. Despite that, I still loved Ben! He was so positive and he seemed to help Fallon in ways that no one else could. He was so encouraging and praising of her, it really was beautiful. I think that everyone of us would love someone to tell us all of the amazing things abut ourselves that we dont see : A body is simply a package for the true gifts inside. And you are full of gifts. Selflessness, kindness, compassion. All the things that matter. Youth and beauty fade. Human decency doesnt. I really liked Fallon, in the moments when she let her guard down you could see what a positive and energetic person she was. It was sad that after the tragic event from her past. she hid that person away. I loved how much she grew throughout the novel, getting stronger and more confident. I think that Ben played a part in that, but she did most of it herself! The secondary characters really helped me to understand both Ben and Fallon. Bens older brothers and Fallons Mother, Father and Bestie really helped build this story for me more. Also, Bens Mother was the one who really helped me to understand him. Each of these played such an important role in this story. OVERALL: Becca: Was this book perfect? No not exactly, I had a couple of issues here and there, and its hard to reveal them without spoiling the story. As a matter of fact, it is very hard to discuss this entire book and not spoil anything. I will say that you definitely have to experience this for yourself and try to go in as blind a possible. I need you to know that it was always you who had my heart. And I would have never let anyone else borrow it if I knew there was a chance in hell youd ever want it back. Throughout the first half of the book, I was just grinning and smiling and loving the banter and connection between Fallon and Ben. Then all of a sudden BAM!! CoHo does what CoHo does best and throws you a curve ball that you did not see coming! I LOVED it! I cried... and cried... and cried some more. I kept texting Lisa... OMG did you get to ?! And she would be like almost there! Then she would get there and we would both be like OMG! OMG! OMG! It was intense and I felt like I was on a roller coaster! As a matter of fact here is one of my status updates on Good Reads: OMG! WTF! Holy friggin hit!! I will always be a huge fan of Colleen Hoover, she is absolutely amazing and can make me think and feel in ways that I never have before. Each of her characters finds a place in my heart and when I think of my favorite books and characters, hers often top my list. She builds characters that are flawed but lovable and forever memorable. I was so excited to get an advanced ARC of this, but I also preordered a physical copy too because I knew this was one I needed on my shelf! If you are fan of CoHo, or even if you are not read this! You will probably cry, but it is worth it and you will definitely be smiling at the end... or maybe even silly giggling
Katy Swartz is forced to leave her life behind when her mother decides to move to West Virginia to start over. Having already lost her father, leaving her home, her friends and her school just before senior year isnt easy. When it turns out her new neighbors are aliens, Katy can almost take that in stride. What she cant take is Daemons hot, cold and colder attitude toward her. Tired of being a pushover, she is determined to stand her ground and fight back. Which proves to be more difficult than she would have imagined. Because as much as she cant stand Daemon, she is drawn to him. With every insult, cruel remark or show of arrogance, her anger grows, but so does her attraction to him. But there are rules. And there are risks involved with getting too close. And if she cant stay away from Daemon or keep him away from her, then it wont be only her, but Daemon and his entire family, that will be in danger.  Obsidian is the electrifying, actionpacked and tensionfilled first book in the new Lux trilogy by author Jennifer L. Armentrout. The immediate, intense and sizzling chemistry between the main character Katy and her next door neighbor Daemon will instantly captivate readers and pull them into this world of rivals, danger and forbidden attraction, that wont let go. In this story of aliens  both good and bad, beautiful and ugly  it is the thrill of danger and the excitement of the unknown that keep these two characters alternately drawn to and repelled by one another. And it is this magnetic pushpull that will keep readers on edge, as they discover just who Daemon really is, just how much trouble Katy is really in and what lengths theyll have to go to keep everyone safe. Author Jennifer Armentrout has managed to write a book about aliens that weaves together elements of science fiction, drama, action and romance in a way that is enticing and incredibly appealing to readers beyond those simply lured in by the science fiction aspect. Right from the start, the tension between these two characters builds and continues to build until they and the reader are ready to explode, making this one electricallycharged and immensely entertaining story that is unputdownable. As this is a novel aimed at a more mature young adult audience, there is a bit more violence, language and sexual content than is typical in a young adult story, but nothing that feels over the top, out of character or unnecessary to the story. Obsidian is a deliciously tormenting, absolutely explosive must read with an ending that will leave readers begging for the sequel. On the blog I gave this my six star rating On a personal note: Obsidian was such an amazing surprise and a book that kept me completely twisted up in knots because of that little dance that Daemon and Katy did throughout the whole entire book. Talk about chemistry. Well, this story was all about the chemistry between the two of them. Sure, there was all sorts of action. The pace was definitely quick. The story was completely intriguing. But it was that electricity between Daemon and Katy that just made this story so aaaahhhhmazing. I dont know how many times I wanted to scream at the two of them to get on with it already because the push and pull was just too tormenting. And yes, I mean tormenting in a really good way. The author did such a fantastic job of keeping me on edge throughout the book, wondering what would happen. When it would happen. If it would happen. I wanted to skip to the end just to find out. I barely restrained myself. Barely. There were a few choice scenes that made my heart race. A few scenes that made my blood boil. And a few scenes that made me so worried the story would end before coming to a satisfying conclusion. And while the author did tease right up to the end, its a conclusion I can live with for the next long while as I wait for the release of Onyx next spring. I love when books surprise me and what a surprise this book was. On so many fronts. I read the first chapter on the authors blog when she posted it and I fell in love with the very hot, very much the bad boy, Daemon Black. What I didnt realize, until I read the description on Goodreads after having requested the book on NetGalley, was that Daemon Black wasnt a demon. This was a story about aliens. I am not a fan of reading science fiction. And Id never read a story about aliens. So when I began reading I was worried that I wouldnt enjoy the premise of this book at all  hot boy or no. Even one where the main character is a book lover and book blogger who does IMM vlogs, WoW posts and sometimes gets zero comments on her reviews. But if all books about aliens were anything like this book, Id proudly wear the I believe Tshirt and download every book I could. Because this story was so addictive and totally unputdownable and I was devastated that it had to end. Katy is not typical of my favorite heroines. She doesnt have nearly the snark of Alex in the authors other series, who I absolutely adore, though shes not weak or completely sarcasmfree. And she definitely has claws. But I like that shes different. And her personality is the perfect yin to Daemons yang. Oh but how I do love Daemon Black. Though Im sure not everyone will. Hes not particularly nice. In fact, he can be downright cruel at times. Most of the time, actually. And hes so unbelievably arrogant. But he has those green, intense eyes. He has some seriously wicked awesome powers. Hes incredibly sexy. And every so often he says or does something surprising. And rarer still, he can be sweet. But its rare. And I dont always trust him. And that name. I love that the author gave him the name Daemon Black, because its so opposite to what exactly he is. Though it suits him  its a hot name and he is definitely hot. As I havent read any other books about aliens, I dont know if the story is unique, but to me it was new and different and fascinating and exciting. I really never thought aliens could be exciting, aside from the kind youd want to annihilate, that is. Though there was one scene in the cafeteria, where Katy noticed the table of too beautiful aliens that kept themselves separate from the human population that did somewhat remind me of another lunchroom and other beautiful people, but that similarity quickly faded when Katy did what she did  Im not saying what  that kept me grinning for several pages. If I could immediately reread this book I would. It was just that good. Ive still got it stuck in my head and I know that even if I were to reread it, Id be just as tied up in knots anytime Katy and Daemon were together as I was on my first read. And there will definitely be a reread of this book once I get the finished copy. If I manage to wait that long. My favorite nonspoilery passage: He lowered his head until the edges of his dark curls brushed my cheek. I was caught between wanting to crawl into my locker and crawl into him.
OHMYGOD I SHOULD NOT HAVE READ THIS!! This short story was sweet and had all of the wonderful characters from The Mortal Instruments and then some. I am so glad that Simon and Isabelle are finally getting married. Who would have thought these two would end up getting married after reading City of Bones? Not me, thats for sure. I totally shipped them when the idea became possible, but I never would have thought they would end up together during the beginning. Theyre perfect together. Im also really happy for Magnus and Alec! Things are so great for them. I only fear what will happen to Magnus years from now, when something happens to Alec. It makes me so sad that Magnus will live forever while Alec will die someday... Also.... WHY WOULD CLARY HESITATE?? She WANTS to marry Jace so why did she hesitate? WHY CASSANDRA WHY?! I CANT WAIT UNTIL MAY TO FIND OUT www.ashleyearley.com www.ashleyearleybooks.tumblr.com www.ashleyearleywrites.blogspot.com Ashley Earley Merged review: Usually, I talk about the writing first. However, seeing how the book is by Cassandra Clare, there really isnt a need. I think we all can agree that her writing is pretty consistent and wonderful. Her characters are equally as wonderful, but were going to talk about them. Unexpectedly, the book started up from the perspective of a brand new character named Kit. This surprised me because I was expecting to be reading through the eyes of Emma Carstairs. I jumped into this book not knowing much about it. I didnt know what the plot would hold. The only thing I was sure of was that there would be some sort of relationship between Emma and Julian that went beyond their parabatai bond. There were a lot of things that caught me off guard about this book. It could have been because I refrained from finding out anything about the book, but regardless, I was still surprised a few times. The Cold Peace, for instance. The law went as far as to punish any Shadowhunters that interfered with Fair Folk business. Mark and Helen Blackthorn are both part Fey, so this concerned me. But we were quickly caught up to speed in the first few pages of Lady Midnight. I was expecting Mark Blackthorn to return, but not in the condition that he was in. I had no idea he would have been tortured and put through so many harsh things. I felt awful for him, especially when he would rock himself in a corner, crying and screaming. Another shock was that he had fallen in love while living with the Wild Hunt. After Mark spoke of the cruel ways of the Hunt, I was shocked to find that he had found someone to love, and someone that loved him in return. This person for Mark was Kieran. The Fey love just as aggressively as they can be fierce. Kierans sad betrayal toward Mark was disappointing in the end. He hadnt meant to hurt anyone. He had only wanted Mark returned to the Wild Huntand to him. He only wanted Mark back, but instead, he had nearly risked the lives of Emma and Julian. This left Mark unable to forgive him, breaking off their relationship. Now, lets talk about Emma and Julian. Julian is a really sweet person that is strong enough to take care of all of his siblings without the help of anyone else, aside from Emma, at least. Jules carried the weight of learning how to take care of his siblings Livia, Tiberius, Drusilla, and Octavia at the age of twelve, along with dealing with his lunacy uncle and leading the Institute. And now, he has to care for his changed halfbrother, Mark. Emma is just as strong and fierce as she was when we first met her in City of Heavenly Fire, if not more so. She is brave and looks after those she loves, though she does feel slightly out of place among the Blackthorn Family. She feels lost without knowing what truly happened to her parents during the Dark War, refusing to believe that Sebastian and his army was the cause of their demise. She cares for the Blackthorn children just as much as Julian even though she feels out of place sometimes. Together, they definitely have chemistry. There IS something there, and there were some parts that were really hot and steamy! I loved it! I especially loved the scene where Julian got hurt and Emma was having trouble healing him. It was SO HOT! What Emma plans to do now is hard for me to swallow. I dont want her to hurt Jules, even though I know shes trying to protect him. I have no idea what is going to happen next. If their romantic relationship starts up, what will happen? If theyre found out, theyll be stripped of their Marks. I really have no idea where this could go and its driving me mad! I NEED TO KNOW!! The Blackthorn Children are older now and getting to know them was nice. I love how they interact! I loved how Edgar Allan Poes poem, Annabel Lee, was entwined with the storyplot. Im not a huge fan of Poe, but I really like Annabel Lee. It was genius how Cassandra Clare mixed it into the story. Malcolms betrayal toward the Blackthorns is sad. His story is even sadder, for he lost his love Annabel Blackthorn. He wanted to bring her back after her own family had killed her, all because she had fallen in love with Malcolm a warlock. It was a bit of a shock for me. After reading about how he interacted and cared for the Blackthorns, I hadnt seen him as anything but a sweet and caring person. A Magnus Bane of this series, if you will. I think thats why Cassandra Clare made Malcolm the socalled bad guy. She knew that her fans would be expecting Malcolm to be another Magnus Bane and look to love him in the same way. IT WORKED. The plot was carefully planned and carried out excellently. Seeing older characters from both The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices was amazing! It made me ridiculously happy to see Alec, Magnus, Clary, Jace, Tessa, and Jem! I love them all, especially Jem. Every time I read Jems name, I literally smiled, because he is my favorite character out of all of Cassandra Clares books. However, I was really sad when Jem got up to leave the room during speeches at Emma and Julians parabatai ceremony. Hearing others talk about their parabatai had been too much to bear after losing his parabatai, Will Herondale. I hope to see more of these characters in the future books in this series. JEM! COME BACK TO ME! I only really have one complaint about the book. The last chapter was slightly rushed. It jumped from the perspective of one character to another. And, more importantly, I felt that Emma didnt have time to process that shed learned of who had killed her parents. She found out who killed them and didnt have time to think about it! She didnt process and she didnt get to see how she felt about taking the revenge shes wanted for the last FIVE YEARS. And the last thing I have to say is.....I CANNOT WAIT FOR LORD OF SHADOWS!! The cover is amazing! BRING. IT. ON. www.ashleyearley.com www.ashleyearleybooks.tumblr.com www.ashleyearleywrites.blogspot.com Ashley Earley Song: Capsize
In a word, I can only describe the Last One as this: unsatisfying. Summary: A woman is participating in a reality show similar to Survivor. She and the other contestants have to survive in the woods alone while being filmed. A week after the show starts, a pandemic sweeps the country. The cameramen and production crew all die; the show stops filming  but the contestants, lost in the woods, dont know because they werent able to be retrieved. Zoo doesnt realize the tragedy and destruction around her is real, or that she is truly alone. Sounds cool, right? Yeah. Thats what I thought, too. Trigger warnings: I saw other posts warning for rape, but there is no rape in this book. There is one very brief mention of an attempted rape, which took place off screen, and all you know is that it happened. BUT, there is a lot of animal death and some of it is graphic. People hunting, killing and skinning animals  strictly to eat, but it might disturb some readers. The good: If youre a fan of dystopia or classic survival stories, you might love this book. It barely qualifies as scifi, though. It was a very fast, easy read, with plenty of action. If youre in the mood for something kind of dark but thats also mindless entertainment, this will do the trick. I really liked some of the supporting characters, especially Brennan and Cooper. The prose was sometimes a little too forced and melodramatic for me, but it was pleasant to read overall. The chapters that took place while the reality show was still filming were good  lots of characters, lots of conflict, and I have a morbid fascination with the contrived drama and absurdity of reality TV. Despite how short this section of my review is in comparison to my complaints below, I cant say I didnt enjoy the story. I lost track of hours reading it, so it definitely held my attention, but I just feel nothing for it. And when I think back on it, Im annoyed because I cant shake the feeling that it could have been so much better. Its the kind of book you could read for a book club or English class and have a ton of interesting material to analyze. In terms of theme and symbolism theres a lot going on. But it failed for me from a storytelling perspective. The bad: The biggest problem was that I could not connect with the protagonist, a character who goes nameless for most of the story but whose reality show nickname was Zoo. I found her dull. While I understand why she clung for so long to the delusion that she was still on the show  nothing that was happening was real, that made it even harder to connect with her POV. Her numb, stoic disconnect from it all  interspersed with bursts of panicked angst about her husband and anxiety about having a baby  made the story feel empty. Her husband was Zoos driving motivation, but he hardly felt real. This character who almost never even appears onscreen took up so many pages. That made it even harder to care about her. I also felt there was a lot of wasted potential in the direction the author chose to take the plot. Why go to the trouble of introducing a cast of diverse characters with varying personalities and skill sets the other contestants on the reality show if you didnt plan to use them at all? Im especially frustrated that Cooper didnt have a bigger role. I kept expecting Zoo to run into him  some of the other contestants again, and then theyd go on traveling and surviving together. But it never happened. Last, the ending was a huge copout. Massive spoilers for the end ahead. Zoo spends most of the book traveling back to her house, wanting to find her husband. She gets there, sees a body in the bed, and doesnt look closely enough to realize its just the dog. She assumes hes dead, grieves, gives up and goes to a refugee camp. He turns out to be alive and looking for her. The book ends with him seeing her on TV and realizing shes alive, but of course she doesnt know yet. We can assume they have a happy but difficult reunion later on and that she eventually moves past her trauma, but we dont see any of that. Its not an open ending. We can deduce what happens next. But we got none of the payoff that the author spent 300 pages building up to. The most emotionally challenging part of the story takes place offscreen, after the end of the book. More huge spoilers: I get that its clever  she left to be on a TV show, which is what separated them in the first place. She spent much of her solo journey thinking she was still on the show and her husband was watching her... which turns out not to be true. But then her appearing on camera is what allows them to be reunited again. Very circular, or whatever. I just dont care. TL;DR: Go for it if you love dystopia or the TV show, Survivor. Stay away if you want characters you can feel invested in. I dont regret borrowing this and its adequate if you just want to be entertaineddistracted, but there are better things you could be reading.
 4.5 Stars  A Gripping and Grimly Decadent Supernatural Thriller Hey, you. You...out there. Have you noticed? Have torn your eyes away from your smartphones and iPads, your Facebook and Twitter accounts, your social networking in any and all forms, and taken a good, hard look around lately? Wars, terrorism, failing world economies, disaster, corruption, pollution, disease, fear, intolerance, hatred. A barrage of seeping, soiled souls spreading like rot over a once fertile landscape. Hard core, irrefutable evidence laid down with fury, as if a thunderous prosecutor is intent on using our obvious damnation as fuel in his apocalyptic war against creation itself. Well...what if he truly is? Or, more rightly put, what if they are? Four demons, once fallen angels condemned by a tyrannical god, cast out of paradise and, with the ancient serpent, tossed into Abaddon. What if they are even now stalking the earth, cloaked in eons of loathing and evil malice for the chattering monkeys that scurry like cockroaches across the face of the planet? Monkeys whose lone worth is the ease of their corruption. What if the four have amassed enough souls? Cast enough into the fires? What if there is enough fuel stored in the shrieking agony of the fires of hell to power the gates of Lucifers locked cell, to finally release him and pour forth unimaginable misery and destruction on a world over which the serpent is determined to rule? And what if those four demons have found the final piece of a prophecy to guarantee their victory, a prophecy so dark, so hideous, that those who have gazed upon it went blind and the pages containing it have been hidden away for centuries? What if, my dear, fellow condemned, God, in all his Old Testament tyranny, turned his back on his creation eons ago, moved away, left no forwarding address, isnt taking any calls, and were really on our own against these four demons? Well...not completely on our own. Theres Batty... Sebastian Batty LaLaurie, bibliophile, theologian, and John Milton fanatic; shameless drunk, willing lout, and utterly broken man. And theres Bernadette Callahan, agent for a secret government group known only as Section; cynic, spy, sometimes killer, always bad ass, and a woman teetering on the brink of physical and mental collapse. Our heroes. Go, Team! The race is long, the clues daunting, the clock ticking down, our heroes over their heads and in constant danger. Across the globe they race, following clues found at the scenes of vicious murders, searching for the brilliant ramblings of a longdead poet, and whispering of conspiracy, prophecy, sacred relics, and holy artifacts, all in an effort to unlock the mystery of the seven pages of the Devils Bible...in the hopes of saving us all. I have a confession to make. I was a little leery of starting this book, knowing up front that it was going to be in a similar vein as The Da Vinci Code with much of the mythology and history motivated by and evolved from John Miltons epic poem Paradise Lost. With all due respect to Dan Brown, I wasnt a fan of The Da Vinci Code in either style or substance, and my vague recollections of Paradise Lost inspired only memories of confusion and frustration during a college class best forgotten. The Paradise Prophecy sat on top of the towering pile of books I intend to read, looking quite fetching as I procrastinated. Only when my guilt about a commitment to review it grew to overshadow my hesitation did I sit down, crack it open, and begin. Mea culpa, mea culpa! Browne knocked me flat with this gripping, thrilling tale of warring dark angels, the contentious value of free will, and the triumphant potential of even a battered human soul. Incredibly imaginative and judiciously executed, Brownes narrative served well as both a homage to Miltons epic poem, wildly and richly mystical, and as a heroic and timely cautionary tale. Incorporating Paradise Lost into the mythology and backstory allowed for The Paradise Prophecy to maintain a note of genuine religious reflection but grounded the story firmly within the comfortable bounds of fiction, instead of it reading like a subversive alternate to historical religious dogma. As a sleek supernatural thriller the book is a blockbuster, with complex, often bedraggled characters who inspire sympathy and a quest that is flawlessly contained to prevent it from slipping the authors control, but is huge enough to be truly epic on its own merits. I have a big soft spot for antiheroes in the books I read, so Batty and Callahan were appealing independently, and working together they were positively inspired. I loved how Browne managed their relationship, and thoroughly appreciated their individuality. I loved Battys sarcasm and his often gloomy view of the world, and adored the strength and intelligence, not to mention the flexibility of thought and motion, that was encapsulated by Callahan. I was especially fond of the roles they had, in which the male lead was the bookish font of all knowledge esoteric...and more than a little nerdy with it, and Callahan was the nononsense female lead who dealt with issues by force instead of emotion. Browne not only tells a wicked tale, but he crafts the telling very well, pacing the plot threads with careful consideration and an eye for the big picture, revealing tidbits of information as it goes along. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout, hungry for the next big reveal, dying to find out how each piece connected. The prose was fluid and dialogue natural, and despite the weighty topic and worldly locations, I never felt I was in over my head with the languages or wealth of information. Neither did I feel like I was being spoon fed a Milton For Dummies retrospective. Browne writes with intelligence, his work literally vibrates with it, but its the sort that embraces and draws you in, instead of slamming into you and demeaning in bites. While its hard to view such a fantastic and entertaining story with a critical eye, there were a few points that left me a tiny bit less satisfied. I was a little put off by the way sex was used in the story, as nothing but a tool or method of corruption. With nothing to balance that, it gave the impression of being a condemnation against sex in general. I also thought there was a time or two when Battys gift came in a little too handy and some very esoteric information fell into his and Callahans lap a little too conveniently as a result. That led to an instance or two where information came out in larger info dumps, instead of in bits and pieces as a natural consequence of actions taken or mysteries revealed. Those issues, however, were minor and didnt detract much from my sheer, unadulterated enjoyment. And enjoy it I did. Very much, in fact. Its so smoothly written, the supernatural elements so perfectly blended with the mystery, thriller, and action adventure elements, that the story unfolds with unusually sharp clarity. I admired every nuanced crevice and appreciated each bit of tone. It all played out like a major motion picture in my head and would be extremely well suited to the big screen. I hope I see it there, and in the meantime, I plan to see what other efforts Browne has published. The Paradise Prophecy may have been my first experience with him as an author but I can guarantee it wont be my last. Excellent read.

Fairytales are supposed to have happy endings. And a Cinderella story is no exception. But when the heroine is a cyborg who would prefer to save herself rather than be rescued by a Prince, things get complicated. And when the Prince has more important things to worry about, like saving his country from a deadly plague and trying to forge an alliance with the leader of a cruel race of Lunar people, finding his Princess and falling in love seem trivial. With time quickly running out, finding a cure and deterring a powerful and evil Queen who has her sights set on the Prince seem much more important than happiness. So, unless there really is some kind of magic wand that can make all of it disappear, survival must win out over love. So much for happily ever after. But then again this is not your average Cinderella story.  Cinder is the instantly captivating, wonderfully imaginative and immensely entertaining first book in the Lunar Chronicles. This clever retelling of the classic Cinderella story is even more enchanting than the original, offering more twists and turns, thrills and excitement. It may start with a once upon a time, but this first book in the series wont stop at happily ever after. The fairytale will immediately draw readers in, but it is the charming, adorable and frightening new characters, the futuristic setting of New Beijing, the deadly threats in this new world, and all the fascinating changes and additions to this story that will keep readers utterly spellbound. This enchanting story is at once familiar and strange. Cinder is a mechanic. Forced to work to support her stepmother and stepsisters, only the youngest who is kindhearted, she is hoping one day to gain her freedom. Though freedom is not something so easily given to someone like her. Someone not entirely human. Cinder is a cyborg. Part human, part machine. Looked upon with disgust, she is not seen as an equal. But when she meets the Prince, he only sees the girl, not the machine. And for a brief moment, Cinder can dream of a better life. However, there are bigger problems in New Beijing. A plague that has been ravaging the planet has reached the city, attacking people close to Cinder and the Prince. And with the unsettling arrival of the Lunar Queen, there are far more important things to deal with than falling in love. Even if her notentirelyhuman heart says otherwise. Author Marissa Meyer has completely transformed this classic story. While still recognizable, giving readers that feeling of familiarity, the author altered the characters, the setting and the world to make it feel new and different and a lot more dangerfilled and suspenseful. By adding in the unexpected, giving the story a depth it didnt before have, and creating such memorable characters, the author has breathed new life into this fairytale story with a book that will leave readers anxiously awaiting the next installment. Cinder is a fastpaced, incredibly addictive start to this new series that is a must read for fans of strong heroines, handsome princes, evil stepmothers, wicked queens and for those who enjoy their fairytales with a twist. On a personal note: I listened to it. I read it. I loved it. Its a must read. And an absolute must read again. Cinder is yet another book that I went into with mild trepidation. I heard great things about it, but I was uncertain if it would be a book Id enjoy. Im not a fan of reading science fiction and the idea of a series called the Lunar Chronicles set off all sorts of warning bells in my head. And while the cover is intriguing  both beautiful and creepy  it, too, made me wonder if I would be able to read this book in its entirety. Even without having read the description, the mechanical leg and the title gave me some inkling of what this story would be about. And I just wasnt sure. My fears were completely unfounded. I absolutely loved this story. I could not get enough of it. And when it ended, I just wanted more. I still do. It was warm and engaging, the characters were easy to connect with, the world was totally fascinating and having the fairytale as the foundation for this story kept me riveted. I wanted to pinpoint where the similarities were. I wanted to see where the differences would lead. I wanted to find out if there would be a happily ever after ending for Cinder and Prince Kai. I had both the audiobook and a printed ARC for review and I decided to listen to the audiobook version first and then read it. And Im so glad I did. I was instantly pulled into the story by the narrator. She brought life to the characters and made me want to know them better. She infused these characters with such personality that they were immediately lovable. But even without the narration, this book was just so easy to love and was totally captivating. I couldnt wait to find out if the story followed the same path as original fairytale. Would Cinder leave behind a glass slipper? Would she have a magical transformation that would allow her to dance with the Prince at the ball? I love, love, love what the author did with this part of the story. But because talking about it would be way too spoilery, I just cant. I never thought I could enjoy a book where the main character was a cyborg. But Cinder is lovable and real and not at all the unthinking, unfeeling machine I thought shed be. Although the most adorable character was Iko, the android. She always made me smile, especially when she swooned over Price Kai. Who was definitely swoonworthy. He was handsome and brave and strong and not in the least bit arrogant. Though he totally could have been. And what an amazing job the author did with the Lunar Queen and her entourage. While I wont say too much about them, I will just say that I love how the author connected them with the fairytale. And as far as personality goes  talk about seriously creepy. I cant believe that the wait for book two is a year. I have a millionandahalf questions about what will happen next. And even though I dont feel like Ive been left dangling off a cliff, I do feel like Im suspended in midair, holding my breath until I can dive into the next book in the series.
I literally didnt have to think twice about giving this book 5 stars. Me Before You is hands down one of the best books Ive ever read and I honestly regret not having read it earlier. A friend of mine gave this book to me as a birthday present about three years ago but I never actually read it mainly because I didnt like that friends taste in books. Due to that MBY has been standing on my bookshelf until it got a lot of new attention when it was made into a movie. I began hearing a lot of good things about this book and so I put it on my TBRlist. But guess what? The book had been standing on my shelf the entire time and it took me until the beginning of this month to realize that the book called An entire half a Year was actually the German version of Me Before You. Long story short, I read this book within two days and I wouldve probably been able to read it within a few hours if I didnt still have to study for my oral alevel exam. Its a very gripping read that captured my attention from the very first to the very last page and it literally gave me all the feels I must admit that I wasnt fully prepared for that.. The book has two strong main protagonists, Louisa and Will, who are great characters that both have a mind of their own. They are not perfect in every way possible; they both have their quirks which make them real people just like you and me. Surprisingly, they were the only two characters I liked. Usually I always like some of the secondary characters as well and Ive also already read books that included secondary characters that I loved a lot more than the actual main characters. MBY on the other hand didnt feature any likeable secondary characters. The only character I could actually bear with was Wills nurse Nathan; but even he did, and said, some things that bothered me a lot. Anyways, he still wasnt as bad as Louisas family which I wouldve killed during the first quarter of the book if I had had the opportunity. And he also wasnt as bad as Wills parents who were representing the cliche image of rich, arrogant people. However, the worst of all was definitely Patrick; that guy was the biggest prick excuse my language ever. I would even kill that guy if we were the last two people on the planet. I wouldnt even care if I were alone afterwards; I would just want to get rid of that idiot. But even all these very unlikable characters couldnt change the fact that I loved this book. After all, these characters just showed what reality is like. We all know people like Louisas family, Wills parents or Patrick. Theyre just like a lot of people we all have to deal with at some point of our life, theres no one out there who only encounters nice people from the start until the end of their days. But thats the point of the entire book; it shows us what reality can be like. Not only are there people out there who have ignorant families or insensitive boyfriends, there are also people out there whose life has changed just as much as Wills life. MBY showed me how fast my life could change, how fast I could have to live a completely different life and that I should live in the moment and do the things I want to do. Tomorrow I might not be able to do them anymore. Its something we all have to realize; we could all suffer the same fate as Will and none of us are protected against such strokes of fate. I think realizing this while reading the book was also what made me extremely emotional towards the end of MBY. It took me a long time to get through the last two chapters of the book because I had grown so attached to Will, that his situation moved me a lot. This book made me cry, it made me cry a lot. It actually made me cry so much that I even had to put down the book at one point close to the end of it because I was just shaking so much. Im usually not a very sentimental person, the only movie that ever made me cry was Marley  Me and there have only been two or three books that ever made me shed a few tears. Me Before You however, is the first book that ever made me cry my eyes out. Im not lying when I stay that it took me an hour to fully calm down after having finished reading this book. Its scary how close to reality this story actually is but it just made me appreciate my life even more. Its a beautiful book with an awesome story. It will most probably 99 make you cry but even if you dont want to cry, you should still read it if you havent read it yet. Thank you Jojo Moyes for writing this awesome book and thank you for being the first author to ever make me cry my eyes out because of a book. I dont like crying but I liked crying over MBY! SPOILERS!!!!!!      Have any of you started reading After You right after finishing Me Before You? Because I literally just cant get myself to read it right now because I cant read about Louisas life without Will in it!!! How am I supposed to ever do that???
I.... Im done. And I have NO idea what Im supposed to do now... I dont even know how to feel.... I honestly just want to cry because its over... Wow. This has got to be some of Cassies best work, in my opinion. I dont even know where to begin! Theres just a lot I need to say. I might ramble quite a bit throughout this review, so I ask that you be patient with me and let me ride it out. Im feeling a LOT of things even after having processed my thoughts for two whole days. First of all, let me say. I absolutely LOVED this book. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Of the 100 things I needed this book to do, 99 of them were fulfilled in this conclusion. And I am on my knees in gratitude for Cassandra Clare. No one has rendered my mind, body, and soul to nonfunctioning capacities like she has and I really doubt no one will again. There were so many happy moments, so many sad moments, so many frustratingly annoying moments coughthe CLAVEcough. It was just really well done! Initially, when Cassie released the length of the book page numbers, I was like Oh no, this will either be really bad or really good. Typically when books are that long, there tends to be a lot of filler or moments of lull boredom. Let me tell you, Cassie is talented and skilled enough to keep you on your toes for all 700 pages. There was not a single moment where I didnt find myself emotionally invested in this book. I was on the edge of my seat. Now before I get into my review of plot, I will say  I am a diehard TMI fanatic. I loved it more than TID. I prefer Jace to Will; Alec to Jem; Clary to Tessa. Thats just my clear and honest opinion. BUT I absolutely ENJOYED The Infernal Devices. I just didnt cry buckets over it once it was over. I just appreciated it as being part of the beautiful Shadowhunter world that Cassie created. Now, onto City of Heavenly Fire... It was so good to see my favorite characters, my dream team, back in action. Jace, Clary, Alec, Isabelle, Simon  all of them hold such a dear place in my heart that I cant believe I went without them for so long. Seeing them banter, tease, and just love one another. It was just so heartwarming. The thing that I love about Cassandra Clare is that even in the midst of battle  a HUGE war  she will still find times for her characters to just love one another. To have fun. And thats so beautiful. Its human. THATS where my focus was in this story. How much humanity still remained, even after Sebastian was trying to steal it all? Cassie teased us about how many deaths there would be in the book  she said six. Six named character would die in this book. I counted more than six, but the word named seems to be subjective. But I think I got named confused with main and just assumed that a lot of the main characters would be biting the bullet. So I read this book with intense trepidation. I just couldnt see any of them dying. I was so in love with all of them  Clary, Jace, Alec, Izzy, Simon, Magnus, Jocelyn, Luke, Maia  and many more. I was so scared reading this book. Im not going to talk about scene after scene because I just dont feel that its necessary. If youve read the book, then you know what Im talking about. If you havent, then I havent spoiled much for you. I just want to discuss the handling of the book over all. Sebastian was always an extremely sinister guy, because he was evil. He had demon blood throughout his body, yet he was still a Shadowhunter. The guy was fucked up  for lack of a better phrase. He didnt care who he hurt or killed as long as his ultimate outcome was achieved. Thats some scary crap. Cassie did a fabulous job making my heart drop whenever he appeared in the book. You just never knew what he was capable of. I mean he KILLED Jordan, for goodness sake . Simply to make a point to the Downworlders! Throughout the book, Cassie continues to show us how heartless Sebastian is, but also how flawed he is. His understanding of the human heart and its capacity to love is clearly skewed, which came to light any time he dealt with Clary or Jace  even with Jocelyn, who he claimed to hate. There were small moments where I found myself feeling sorry for him. I pitied Sebastian. All of this anger and hate, yet youre still searching. Thats a very human reaction. I know a few people like that, except not so hellbent on the destruction of people. Clary constantly struggled with her feelings for Jonathan, her brother and Sebastian, her nemesis. Jace struggled with that damned heavenly fire; Simon with his feelings for Izzy and Alec  who was probably one of the biggest highlights of the book for me  with his relationship or lack thereof with Magnus, as well as his personal philosophy of what the Clave represents. Especially with a Daylighter amongst your closest ranks. Izzy still struggled with Maxs death. I never really realized how much she struggled with it. But its definitely understandable considering how it happened. The romantic relationships continued to grow and develop throughout the book, in spite of a HUGE war at their doorsteps. And I loved that. Dont stop living because of war, life still goes on. From Simons drunken love confession to Magnus inability to keep his lips to himself to Jaces propensity to have condoms while in hell  Cassie thought about her fans when writing this book. There were extremely sad moments, extremely painful moments, extremely angry moments, and extremely happy moments. It was honestly the best emotional roller coaster that Ive been on. I got to fall in love with new characters  Julian and Emma  who were SUCH badasses. I loved them. And Im so happy that theyll be taking us into the next Shadowhunter series, The Dark Artifices. The Downworlders from Raphael to Luke to that damn Seelie Queen were so crucial to the fantastic execution of this book. The final chapter and the epilogue were pure perfection for me. As a TMI fan, I got closure. As a TID fan, I got feels. I honestly felt that everything happened for a reason. And I was fine with it. I was happy. I cried when I turned that final page and closed the book, but I was happy. Id say this was an extremely satisfactory ending to a wellloved series. Cassie loves us her readers and she loves her characters. She did us and them justice. You could FEEL that she thought about us as she wrote this book. Was there enough tragedy in this final installment? My answer to that is: Yes. because death is easy; its living thats hard. And to add onto that, surviving a war and living with those scars the loss of a loved one is one of the most tragic and most difficult things to do. That was apparent in this book. The road to recovery is NOT easy. Cassandra Clare, I hear you. I thank you. I love you. You gave me SIX beautiful books NINE, including TID and I will never be able to repay you. I cant wait to be taken on another fantastic journey into the Shadowhunter world. I am humbled. P.S. I would talk about all the feels I got from seeing my favorite TID characters mingling and interacting with my favorite TMI characters, but that would be a little too much feels for me and Ill talk for ages. Just know that it was EPIC and everything I needed it to be! I LOVED it all!
Reread Jan 8  13 2017 Loved rereading it the second time :. Same comments as my original review. Originally Read Jan79 2016 4.5 stars Its not fair. WHY? I ask this because this time round, the story gets so intense towards the end! I LOVED IT. Hmmm Im not so sure about Queen Levana. The glimpse we had of her, wasnt very deep. I hope she becomes deeper in the next books, rather than a cardboard cut out of a villain! More Later! This book..... U P D A T E P L O T The plot of this book is loosely based on Little Red Riding Hood. More like inspired by! Half of this book follows the story of Scarlet, our Main Protagonist for this novel, while the other half focuses on whats happening with Cinder, Kai, and Thorne. Its a very simple plot that builds, and builds, and then climaxes shockingly, before riding the intense rollercoaster all the way to the end of the book. Unfortunately I cant say much more about the plot without giving away the whole thing!! I will say that Cinder becomes a fugitive in this book, on top of all the other labels that have been attributed to her. C H A R A C T E R S Scarlet  I actually really liked Scarlet. Shes pretty out there like Cinder, action first then think later, but unlike Cinder whos more prone to blaming herself, Scarlet is a little firecracker. Shes definitely true to the stereotypical red head, all hot and fiery, and not afraid at all. Yet, she is also very grounded in the fact that there are some events beyond her abilities and she should be scared. And so there are a few screamy moments, but never once, not once does Scarlet really let it get to her. She bites back even when shes scared, but she never does anything stupid. When she knows shes helpless against her enemy, she holds back and waitsish. Omg Wolf. You know I knew he was shifty from the start. Isnt the Wolf always shifty? But man, when the twist came out, it definitely was not what I expected. If I expected one thing about his character, that wasnt it. And I was shocked! Wolf has replaced Kai on my list of awesome male characters in the Lunar Chronicles. But really, I think after reading Cress, my list is going to change again. I suppose it cant be helped, not with the way Meyer works her romances, her plot, and her characters! Cinder is back! And boy I love her a lot more in Scarlet than I did in Cinder. Shes just so much more calmer and relatable. And you know, the character development for her worked for the better. Love her. Now, she just has to do everything she has to do and maybe save the world by the end of it. Kai is also back! And we get to see more from his perspective, but I think I liked seeing him better from only Cinders pov, since hes a tad bit helpless in his currently situation. Though, I guess he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. And he knows what he has to do, but he hovers and keeps hoping to find Selene, but sometimes I think he could be doing more. Then again, he is young and has just become Emperor, and just a little bit unprepared. Still, hes been trained for this all his life so it shouldnt have been too difficult to make a steady choice rather than letting it crumble so badly under his fingers? And yet at the same time, its not so bad! Kais characterparts I mean. Meyer does write him believably enough. Supporting. Thorne! We meet Thorne in Scarlet and he plays a small role as a companion to Cinder when she escapes from prison. IKO, Im so glad shes back, love her. And all other supporting play interesting small roles, no one else, I think, is worth mentioning much without giving away some spoilers. S E T T I N G Set in New Beijing, a futuristic city thats the centre of the Eastern Commonwealth, developed after World War 4 or something like that. You get the point. Its a scifi futuristic story. There are cyborgs people living on the Moon which is referred to as Luna, and the inhabitants, Lunars who possessed bioelectric manipulation abilities. In addition to my comments about the world in my Cinder review, I do feel that the labelling of the political divisions bugs me a lot. I still cant get the term Eastern Commonwealth through my head. I mean logically its correct, but it just doesnt sound right. I mean, really, Commonwealth is obviously commonly associated with the British Empire. And Britain and things like Chinaother Asian countries dont really mesh well in my head. Then again, has Meyer mentioned who is part of the Eastern Commonwealth? Id love to know. Anyway, enough of me picking at the world a bit moreIm sorry, I cant help it, it reminds me so much of the world of the Selection which I didnt really like at all, and at least the world of the Lunar Chronicles is a little bit better. W R I T I N G Even better than Cinder! But still that familiar style, mixing the emotive with the action. She has written in 3rd person, and the story alternates among a number of perspectives. I like her style, simply because she makes the whole story very exciting! O V E R A L L This book ended up with such a big bang, even bigger than the first book, and I was blown away. So blown away I didnt hesitate to pick up Cress, which Im reading right now and wondering if the sun in Aus is causing me to melt, or if its the book? By the way, if you didnt really like Throne of Glass as a High Fantasy YA series, then dont give up yet! Try the Lunar Chronicles. This, actually, might be one of a few which I would actually recommend and suggest as a science fiction, high fantasy YA read. It just has all the elementsonly at a YA level of an adult equivalent. Action, a bit of romance, intense epic plot about an evil queen and the girl who will defeat her.
I heard of The Fault in Our Stars a year ago when everyone was falling in love with it. Of course, my curiosity was piqued, but I kept waiting for the fuss over this book to calm down, because I tend to be pesimistic when a new story gets published and everyone goes gaga over it. But it never did. It constantly grew and in return TFiOS received more attention. Then it got a movie deal. And on and on and on, this book was everywhere, on blog posts with titles that start with Favorite, dominating tops and polls on Goodreads and, of course, on Bestseller lists. So I finally deceided to read it. And now Im dead inside. Thats the thing about pain, Augustus said, and then glanced back at me. It demands to be felt Some would say that this book is about cancer. Well, let me disagree. This book is about life. Its about love, friendship, trust, family, loss and everything in between. Its about how to live, how to accept your fate and how to find yourself. This spectacular tale is told from Hazel Grace Lancasters perspective. Shes truly an unique character. Strong. Realistic. Intelligent. Dedicated. And pretty weird. But all these things together make her so special. I respected her so damn much throughout the book, because shes a fighter. One that fights her battles trying to keep the loved ones at bay. I cant imagine being in her shoes and I believe shes one hundred times stronger than I am. Im a grenade and at some point Im going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties, okay? And theres the romance part that involves our narrator. She falls in love with the amazing Augustus Waters... Hes... I have no words for him, besides perfect. Not an ideal perfection, like Prince Charming although Gus wears his charm like no other, but a real one. I know perfect means flawless and all that jazz, but call me crazy when I say he has flaws and hes still perfect. He made me swoon, he made smile, he made me cry and he made me laugh. He made me appreciate life at a whole new level and he made me reconsider my future and some of my past decisions. His personality is amazing and hes definitely one of my favourite book boyfriends. I felt the need to hug him, to kiss him, to never let him go. So yes, I love Augustus Waters. Oh, I wouldnt mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you. Let me just say that these two together are soo damn sweet and cute and funny and adorable and lovable! Their love is beautifully expressed in words, and I can share a quote to show you how perfect they are for each other, but it wouldnt be enough. I would have to copy all the book  and last time I checked, it was still illegal to do that. Im in love with you, he said quietly. Augustus, I said. I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. Im in love with you, and Im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. Im in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have, and I am in love with you. Hazel and Gus parents are wonderful. I loved how caring, acceptable and understanding they are. And Isaac was also a great character Ive become instantly attached to. His friendship with Gus was simply great. I feel sorry for Peter Van Houten, regardless of the fact that he is a pretty shitty person, because his story is also touching. Nonetheless, all the characters that Mr. Green created are special. But I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world without him. Now, dont believe this novel is all hearts and flowers. Nope. Theres comic relief and hilarious scenes, moments when everything is dipped in happiness and you just continue to read with a goofy smile on your face. But lets remember that cancer plays a big part in TFiOS. And trust me: Its a complete tearjerker. I NEVER cried before while reading a novel. Sure, I got tearryeyed once in a while, but that was it. No big rivers on my face or silent sobbing. Until now. And holy crap, what a waterfall this book triggers! Guys, its incredibly sad. Heartbreaking. Gutwrenching. I was in denial after a jawdropping revelation and kept telling myself: No, no, no, it cant be true, the author is messing with my mind and feelings. But apparently, he wasnt. Gulp I still had hope and then sob out of nowhere sob Chapter 21 killed me on spot, after the previous chapter made my eyes go all blury and red and wet. So unattractive. Sniff Shit, I have to get to the next point or otherwise Ill be transforming into Niagara. Sob Again. Sniff John Green is undoubtly a literary genius. His writing style mixes simple dialogue with touching and profound emotions and the result is aweinspiring. Im his newest fan and hes on my autobuy list from now on. My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations. I dont know what to say that hasnt been already said by thousands of other readers. The Fault in Our Stars is, hands down, an outstanding novel. A must read for any fan of good literature. The characters will capture your heart and then the story will break it in a gazillion little pieces, just like shooting stars. But the journey is an incredible and emotional rollercoaster, one that you will treasure with all your being and youll remember for the rest of your existence. I cannot recommend this book enough. Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. ENJOY!3 You can also find this review here: 
Book Review Third in The Lewis Trilogy, The Chessmen brings us to the conclusion of the trilogy. This time, the crime bears some resemblance to the The Lewis Man, in that a cold case appears to have been unearthed as a small airplane bearing the body of a murdered musician is uncovered from a Lewis Island loch lake some seventeen years later. What struck me in this reading as well as the previous novels is Mays dedication to the art of writing a novel. The man spent five years on the island in order to write his trilogy, an outsider in a world where inhabitants would be suspicious of anyone inquiring into their lives see links below pointing to some videos of that endeavor. This dedication comes across quite clearly in the beautiful passages that describe the Hebrides. Theres an art to writing descriptive passages, to write them so that readers not familiar with the geography can quite clearly envision something with which they are not familiar and infuse such passages with delicate descriptions mirroring plot events to come. It comes across in the deep characterization and psychological motivations that spark the events in the novels so that the reader is mesmerized and being prepared like food in a slow cooker for the climactic ending. Masterful storytelling, in my opinion. Ive read some reviews where bringing in unknown characters, former friends of Fins, disconcerted some readers as theyd have preferred the characters mentioned in the first two in the trilogy. This concept of character focus, according to the author, was a deliberate move as he wanted to focus the second and third in the trilogy on other persons from Fins life, to move the focus away from Fins story as it were while maintaining his narrative voice. To accomplish this, Ive noted Peter Mays use of cold cases to unearth these formerly unknown childhood strings into Fins life as each cold case places the focus on a different set of characters from Fins life. Personally, this did not bother me at all. On the contrary, I thought it an excellent authorial device. Lewis Island and subsequent Hebrides islands, though a bubble set apart from the rest of the world, nevertheless are inhabited by a substantial number of people. Couple that with Fins knowledge of a lot of it, to have introduced characters in previous books that were not directly tied to the crime would have been to needlessly introduce insignificant details that would have detracted, rather than add to the novels in question. Whistler for example, a significant character in this novel, had no close ties to Artrair the main adversary in The Blackhouse, nor had he close ties to the characters in the second, given his solitary life. Primary characters throughout the three novels remain, of course, part of this novel. Im happy with this being a trilogy. All good things must come to an end there are some series authors that might learn from this. I will be interested to see how Ill receive some of Mays other books as I intend to read them. With some trepidation, I might add. Too often it is the case that authors known for an excellent series fall flat when attempting something else. Well see. Here are some links to videos you might be interested in after reading this trilogy along with some samples of Gaelic music. I do not recommend viewing these before a reading, as inevitably you will lose some of the magic in Mays descriptive prose with preconceived notions because of having viewed the videos first. Ive also included the link to a video from which May took his characterization of the formidable Whistler. The award winning video that inspired the Whistler character. The Blackhouse  the story behind the publication Peters research video from the Isle of Lewis Peters research video for the The Lewis Man Book trailer for The Lewis Man Peters research video for The Chessmen Peter May interview on The Blackhouse Series review The Lewis Man Trilogy is a triumvirate of crime novels coalescing the life of Fin Macleod, an Edinburgh Scottish policeman, who upon his return to the island of his birth some eighteen years later discovers he has in many ways never left Lewis Island. If you are so inclined to pick up this crime series be prepared for an extraordinary journey into Gealic culture: its remoteness from mainland life, its Gaelic music, customs, lifestyles, religion, and its fascinating look into the Hebrides islands psychology and people. Haunting in its retrospective, the trilogy moves its readers into the harsh conditions that encompass Fins youth growing up on Lewis Island and onward into his life as as a policeman who answers the call of the Hebrides where his Gaelic roots make him the obvious guy for the job to uncover the truth behind a heinous murder that has taken place on Lewis Island. The Blackhouse marks the return of Fin MacLeod to his birthplace, a move marked with significant trepidation on Fins part. He never intended such a return, did not wish it, were it not for suspicious similarities to a murder he was investigating in Edinburgh. What follows is an intricate exposition across three books where the personal reasons of why Fin MacLeod left the island and refused to return to it are studied and laid bare for Peter Mays readers. The trilogy encompasses three crimes, each the focus of its respective novel. Briefly, the first involves the discovery of a disemboweled man hanging from the rafters of a boat house on Lewis Island. The second focuses on the discovery of a young man found pickled and preserved in the bogs some fifty years later, again on Lewis Island. The third takes place when a loch lake on Lewis Island suddenly drains itself of all water only to reveal a long submerged airplane containing the body of a famous Gaelic musician who had mysteriously disappeared some seventeen years earlier. Critical to an understanding of the trilogy is that the Hebrides is presented as a sort of bubble in which nothing changes. It is to this bubble that Fin, who was determined to escape the harsh island life to go to university in Glasgow, returns eighteen years later in the first of the triumvirate novels. Marked with tragedy, Fins life orbits forward by this very return to his roots. The first centers itself around Fin MacLeod, the second and third novels though told from Fins perspective center themselves on the characters from Fins childhood, characters who continue to live unchanged within the bubble. Fin, no longer a policeman but with the heart of an inspector, slowly unravels the mysteries in full concert with his boyhood friends, lovers and foes. The powerful psychology of its characters, the delicate tapestry and ethnographic study of the Hebrides, the beautiful and descriptive passages that open the imagination of its readers, and the incredible story that is unveiled throughout the three novels make this trilogy one of the best Ive read.
First up, LETS TALK ABOUT THAT COVER! It really is a thing of beauty. In fact, it is so gorgeous that I would love to have it as a poster on my wall, right next to my bed. And let me tell you, thats a prime spot for a poster. So whoever designed that cover  FREAKING GOOD JOB! If I ever write a book, I would want you to design my cover. Now that the cover admiration is over I MEAN LOOK AT IT, it is time to talk about the book itself. My expectations were extremely high, probably the highest for any 2016 release Ive heard about so far. Expectations can be dangerous, and I feel more often than not, the book itself does not match all of the anticipation and excitement Ive centered around it. That wasnt the case with The Love that Split the World. This book completely and utterly blew me away and provided me with a memorable reading experience. If you are familiar with my blog or my previous reviews, you might know that I like to drag Friday Night Lights and my lover Tim Riggins to every conversation possible. When the official descriptions for books actually mention Friday Night Lights, I am ready to party! With The Love that Split the World, theres also a mention of The Time Travelers Wife, which I was not a huge fan of, but honestly, because that FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS mention is there, I dont really care the thing is though that if it would have only mentioned The Time Travelers Wife, I probably would not have been as excited. The FNL reference is not there for a reason. Theres football involved in this story, though that definitely isnt the focus of it. And then theres Beau, who instantly reminded me of Tim Riggins. Hes bit of a partyboy at least thats his reputation, he lives with his washed out brother Billy Riggins, anyone? and even the way he is described to look like instantly made me see Tim Riggins I often see Tim Riggins in many descriptions, just because he is SO DREAMY. So, how does our main character Natalie and Beau aka almostasdreamyastimriggins meet? Well, to get an answer to that, we first need to look into Natalie. In her childhood Natalie spent many a night talking to Grandmother, a mysterious apparition that shows up on her bedside and tells her stories that are part of Natalies personal history. When Natalie was a baby, she was adopted by her parents from a young Native American girl who struggling with honey and the rules of her reservation saw it best to give her child elsewhere. After those first few years old ignorant bliss, Natalie started to notice that she does not exactly look like the rest of her family. Through the stories told by Grandmother, she gets a touch into her true heritage and identity. Natalie is about to graduate and spend her last summer in Kentucky before attending college when Grandmother shows up again after three years of absence. This time she tells Natalie that she has three months to save him without specifying who that him is. The next time, the roads of Natalie and Beau get entwined and very soon Natalie realizes that Beau will play a huge role in her mission for the summer. The characters in this book are so great! Natalie is such an interesting character to read about, and I loved the fact that as a reader, I got a chance to make discoveries about her at the same time she does. This made it easy for me to identify with her, to some extent, and more importantly, to feel for her and to connect with her on a very deep level. I also really liked the fact that there are two guys in Natalies life without a very epic and cliche love triangle. Theres Matt, Natalies first love and exboyfriend who proves himself to be something completely different Natalie thought. And then theres the wonderful Beau, whos slightly mysterious and might not be heard of for days there will be a very good explanation for that, but whos also so kind that it kind of makes Natalie want to cry. I am also a huge fan of YA novels that involve some kind of family component, and this one has that too! The fact that Natalie is adopted creates an interesting tension between the daughter who is trying to find herself and the family that is desperately trying to prove to Natalie that she fits in despite her different heritage. I love the way Emily Henry writes the interactions between Natalie and her family, especially Nat and her mother. For a while now, Ive been a huge fan of amazing friendship narratives! And believe it or not, The Love that Split the World has that too it really is true, this book pretty much has anything I want from a YA novel. The friendship between Natalie and her best friend Megan is complex, loving, filled with humor and not without its problems. They do not agree about everything and their friendships is not just pillow fights and talking about boys okay I dont remember when I actually read a friendship story that was like this, but you probably get my point, which makes them much more real. They are not afraid to laugh at each other and I got the feeling that whatever they come across, they will get through it with each others support. I bet a lot of the things I have mentioned in this review so far instantly make you think about a contemporary novel expect maybe the randomly appearing grandmother, but The Love that Split the World is so much more. Theres an element of time travel in it which adds an element of the fantastical to it. Then theres also this aspect to the novel that introduces the reader to psychological terms and practices through the counselling Natalie does in an attempt to get in contact with Grandmother to gain more information about her mission. The stories Grandmother tells to Natalie also add an element of fantasy to the story as well as an almost dreamlike quality. Emily Henry writes with so much detail that at no point while reading this I felt like naah, this does not just feel realexplained enoughlogical. From page one until the very end, I was extremely immersed with this story and couldnt stop turning the pages so I could learn what happens to Natalie, her family, Beau, Matt, Megan and the others. While reading this book, I continually had the sense that Emily Henry has put so much passion and research and love towards the details of this story and its characters. The Love that Split the World is a marvel of young adult literature, a beautiful and vivid tale about family, trust, heritage and first love. It took my breath away, provided me with an extremely enjoyable reading experience and proved to me, once again, why I love young adult literature so damn much.
Winter by Marissa Meyer is the fourth and final book in The Lunar Chronicles series. Winter continues on where readers last left off with our main characters Cinder, Scarlett, and Cress while telling readers more about the character of Winter. Winter is a character in the series who readers have seen on and off throughout a good portion of the novels but for the first time she is taking on a main character role. Winter is a princess admired by the people regardless of the facial scars that have altered her appearance from many years ago. In fact, most of her people would argue that the scars dont matter, shes stunningly beautiful regardless. Princess Winter has been dealing with the main villain of The Lunar Chronicles more than anyone else, she knows more about her than anyone else, because the main villain is her stepmother Levana. When Winter crosses paths with the rest of our main characters she suddenly has a choice to make; should she back down and stick her normal life she has been living or should she stand up, start a revolution, take her rightful place on the thrown, and end a war that has divided the world that she lives in? This was my most anticipated read of 2015. I have written it down on calendar when it was coming out, I had preordered it months before, as soon as the release date was announced I ran to my laptop to preorder it. Winter and I had an interesting struggle at first, starting with the fact that I did not even receive my copy until about a week after it actually came out, thank you Amazon for that one. When it got to my apartment it was damaged and we all know how I feel about damaged books, so off it went back into the mail. On November 15th I finally received my copy and sat down to read it. I tell you this not because I want you to hear all my struggles but because I want everyone to know going into reading this review how seriously I took this book. This is one of my favorite series of all time and I had extremely high hopes for this final novel. It did not disappoint. Lets start with the characters, shall we? Winter was above and beyond what I had expected her to be in the best ways possible. She was kind to a fault and given her upbringing thats hard to be. She cares about her people with so much, with all that she has, that she lets her own mental health suffer. Winter quickly became one of my favorite characters in the series because of this novel. Meyer does an incredible job with character development throughout this series and its not just with Winter, its with all her main characters. Cinder, Scarlett, and Cress grew just as much if not more than Winter did in this novel. I have to applaud Meyer for what she has done with this series. In every single book not only would she focus on a new main character, but she would continue the journey of the other main characters at the same time. As a reader I have seen writers do this before and it usually makes for a long, drawn out story... that is not the case with Meyer and The Lunar Chronicles. The novels flow so effortlessly that I didnt even consider how long they were or how many pages they were I just wanted to know what was going to happen and Winter is no exception to that. I simply cant talk about characters without discussing one of my favorites and who shines so brightly in this series conclusion, Jacin. I have a weakness for male characters who would do anything for the women that they love so it should come as no surprise to anyone that I freakin adore Jacin. He is fearless to a fault when it comes to protecting Winter. I have never wanted two characters to get together more in a novel than I did for Jacin and Winter. Thats saying something because as readers, we all have those characters that we ship right away. What was so amazing, in my opinion, about Jacin though was that he wasnt just there to be a romantic interest for Winter he was his own human being. Learning about him as a person, separate from Winter, was one of my favorite parts of this concluding novel. Winter was not just an amazing novel, it was an amazing concluding novel. I specify that because I have noticed, specifically with Young Adult novels, that sometimes the conclusion novel falls flat. Meyer not only didnt let her conclusion fall flat but she succeeded in creating, in my opinion, the best novel in The Lunar Chronicles series. Winters story didnt just conclude, every main characters story concluded. I didnt feel like one character was the main focus at all, even though the novel is called Winter. I felt that it was a journey that all of our main characters were on together and completing together. I cried more than once during Winter and took longer to read it than I should have simply because I didnt want it to end, I wanted these characters and this world to go on for as long as it possibly could. The Lunar Chronicles series is a series that will go down in history for me as one of my favorite series of all time. I am always recommending the series to any of my friends who read and even those who dont read. I will give these books to my children to read, someday when I have children. I think Meyer created a world unlike any other I have ever read before and it is because of this that she has made her way to my list of authors that no matter what they come out with, no matter what their novels are about, I will them up instantly without a regret in the world. Winter was an amazing novel, an amazing conclusion to a wonderful series, and simply put all around magical.
Not that this really needs to be said anyways because you can already see this above, but The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most solid fivestar ratings Ive ever given in my whole Goodreads career. And this review will be spoilery so if you dont want to know dont go past this point. And, again, my stupid computer shut down on me while I was writing this so now I have to rewrite this all again. Sigh. I got this book totally on coincidence. I was just browsing through Barnes and Noble, not really planning on buying anything, when I came upon three full shelves of The Fault in Our Stars. Even then, I wasnt really planning on buying it shame on me I know what was I even thinking but then I saw that one lone book on the shelf had a bright yellow sticker on it saying, signed by John Green! I opened the book to the front page and saw his signature in green ink. Enjoying the irony, I picked it up and decided to buy it; clutching it to my chest and carrying it up to the counter. And let me say that was one of the best literary decisions of my life. This is how I feel about this book in gif form, just let me tell you: Seriously; Im going to put it in a glass case on top of a red velvet pillow and honor it for all my days I dont really know what else to say besides that this book was amazing. Absolutely incredible. And, personally, I think it was because how close I am to death. My dad died when I was 15 of a sudden heart attack  Here is my review for a book called A Monster Calls that you should also read where I go more indepth about it, for those of you who didnt know, and so many things that Hazel and Augustus went through were reflected in me. The absolute hate she had for people who smoked; wasting perfectly good lungs when she basically had none is my distaste for people who dont take care of their hearts when one visit to a doctors office and a couple of small pills would save their life. When Augustus broke down and admitting that everything wasnt alright; that this wasnt fair, is something that Im still going through in my own life. When they held Augustus funeral in the bottom of the church and had a heartwrenching, grosssobbing, twistyourfaceintothemostdisgustingangelsandfeellikeyourowninsidesaretearingyouapartwhileyouscream mourning was the same thing I went through with my own friends a couple days after he died. And, like Hazel, that was more of my own person funeral for my father than his real one ever was. All of the facebook posts of people who didnt know Hazels Augusts just like they didnt know my father. When they both went to Germany and found out even the person you hold in the highest esteem, is practically untouchable by bad, turns out to disappoint you. The act of doing absolutely nothing important with a person that means everything. The Fault in Our Stars hit me at every emotional angle possible. Props to you, Green. And just the characters by themselves are just so unique and special in their own right, and it was a really tight tie between Hazel and Augustus as my favorite I mean come on that letter he wrote about her at the end ripped my heart out and spread it to the four corners of the earth, never to be seen again., but Hazel still won out just because of who she is. You knew who she was and what she stood for the minute you read her first paragraph in the book, and still kept her core beliefs throughout the novel, even though her perception did change, but whose wouldnt after meeting the man that is Augustus? I loved absolutely every single facet of her. She was the steady rock that guided me through Greens book. And this is all I have to say to her: And Augustus. Oh my baby Augustus. He is everything I never knew I wanted in a male character and more. He also gives a big thankyou from me for everything he did for me and for Hazel, and he was the storm that ruffled her life because, although she was a rock, she was too much of a rock, and he lifted her up so she could reach her full potential and not just keep sinking into the ground from her own weight. They were both just right for each other. And that letter that he wrote at the end had me going: But then I wanted it all at the same time. It was all too much for me. And the fact that they had sex? Just ugh. Thank you for that, John Green. And speaking of that man, his writing alone was like literary porn in a way that I couldnt stop reading it. Heres the first paragraphs: Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death. Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really. But my mom should be adjusted and also I should attend a weekly Support Group. This Support Group featured a rotating cast of characters in various states of tumordriven unwellness. Why did the cast rotate? A side effect of dying. The Support Group, of course, was depressing as hell. It met every Wednesday in the basement of a stonewalled Episcopal church shaped like a cross. We all sat in a circle right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would have met, where the heart of Jesus would have been. I noticed this because Patrick, the Support Group Leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked about the heart of Jesus every freaking meeting, all about how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in Christs very sacred heart and whatever. So heres how it went in Gods heart: The six or seven or ten of us walked wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didnt die and now here he is, a fullgrown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way slowly working his way toward a masters degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life. AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY! Justjust let me hug you, John Green. And the plot is enjoyable, simple, but complex enough that youre still not exactly sure where its going, but that actually excites you. You want it just the way it is. I would not change a single word of the whole book. And, okay, did anyone else think that it was just going to end abruptly like the book inside the book did? Because I sure as hell thought so, and although I still love the ending and would never change it, I was almost disappointed that didnt happen somehow. I cant be the only one that was thinking that, can I? Anyway, this was an incredible book, as per usual for our John Green, and I will treasure if for years to come I wasnt joking about putting it in a glass case, people. And I suppose I will see you all at the next book that makes me cry, an event I look forward to and dread.
Breathtaking. I fell in love with this book as if I had visited the circus myself. Simply magical. The circus arrives without warning. Le Cirque des Reves. The Circus of Dreams. The Night Circus. The complex board for a game of sorts, a test of illusion and manipulation, sheer will and innate ability. A challenge, with only one victor. A mirror you look in to see the other half of yourself. This review is surprisingly difficult to write. Reading this book was like seeing a dream you had cherished greatly become real before your very eyes, or watching the life and death of a single red rose. I felt strongly as if I was watching a chess match from beginning to end  for how often the characters insisted it was not like chess, the structure of the book as a whole certainly was. I am strictly a chess amateur, but there is always the same pattern when I play with a close friend of mine: Part I, when my opponent and I begin deciding what our strategy should be, and feeling each other out without making any explicit moves towards or away from the other. Part II, when we attack headon; my wits and quick thinking against his careful planning and skill, minor pieces leaving the board to be replaced with stronger ones, no longer testing the waters but coming face to face with each others expert maneuvers. Part III, when a key piece is lost, and suddenly you witness your fortress tear apart at the seams until it is simply the two of you, no longer able to win or lose, stuck at a stalemate where each of you is too clever to do anything except purposefully end the game and stand to lose a part of yourself. Standing on the platform in the midst of the crowd, high enough that they can be viewed clearly from all angles, are two figures, still as statues. They stand entwined but not touching, their heads tilted towards each other. Lips frozen in the moment before or after a kiss. Though you watch them for some time they do not move. No stirring of fingertips or eyelashes. No indication that they are even breathing. They cannot possibly be real, someone nearby remarks. Many patrons only glance at them before moving on, but the longer you watch, the more you can detect the subtlest of motions. The change in the curve of a hand as it hovers near an arm. The shifting angle of a perfectly balanced leg. Each of them always gravitating towards each other. Yet still they do not touch. This is how the challenge has gone for many, many years, and yet Celia and Marco are the ones who stand to break the tradition apart. At first it is in a much less noticeable way, from the way the circus is constructed and moved, to who is picked to be the pieces in the challenge of the circus. Then it grows, tent by tent, Celia and Marco each showing their hand to the other  falling deeper in love to someone they have never truly met, and yet know almost as well, if not better, than they know themselves. When it crests, it as if the whole world quakes beneath them. This kind of love that they share with each other is not the kind you see in your average romance novels: where a character may gravitate towards their love interest like a moth to a flame, Celia and Marco collide with a force that echoes deep into your very bones. It is a fiery, passionate form of selfdestruction, suffocating in its intensity, but purer than an uncut gemstone for all of its disturbing beauty. This is not the kind of romance that you would sigh after reading and say, oh, I wish I could be swept away on an adventure like that! It is difficult and melancholy with the pain of raw emotion that torments and shakes you long after the memory has faded away. The sign outside this tent is accompanied by a small box full of smooth black stones. The text instructs you to take one with you as you enter. Inside, the tent is dark, the ceiling covered with open black umbrellas, the curving handles hanging down like icicles. In the center of the room there is a pool. A pond enclosed within a black stone wall that is surrounded by white gravel. The air carries the salty tinge of the ocean. You walk over to the edge to look inside. The gravel crunches beneath your feet. It is shallow, but it is glowing. A shimmering, shifting light cascades up through the surface of the water. A soft radiance, enough to illuminate the pool and the stones that sit at the bottom. Hundreds of stones, each identical to the one you hold in your hand. The light beneath filters through the spaces between the stones. Reflections ripple around the room, making it appear as though the entire tent is underwater. You sit on the wall, turning your black stone over and over in your fingers. The stillness of the tent becomes a quiet melancholy. Memories begin to creep forward from hidden corners of your mind. Passing disappointments. Lost chances and lost causes. Heartbreaks and pain and desolate, horrible loneliness. Sorrows you thought long forgotten mingle with stillfresh wounds. The stone feels heavier in your hand. When you drop it in the pool to join the rest of the stones, you feel lighter. As though you have released something more than a smooth polished piece of rock. If I could spend this entire review just quoting passages about the Circus, I would. There are so many excellent ones that resonated deeply with me. To be frank, the best part of this book was the writing. I cant say that I have ever read a book that was so full of imagery and imagination amongst the hundreds of books I have read in my lifetime. The entire novel felt real, the same way that you can wake up in a dream and not realize that you are still asleep. I could picture myself in every tunnel, every tent, as if I was the patron and they were the ones watching me. Each of the characters was fleshed out and developed in an incredibly unique way. The story progressed with them, moved next to them in their carts on the circus train, watched their performances, and attended Midnight Dinners right alongside them. Even talking about them feels like dancing as they danced with the grace of gymnasts. When they cracked, you cracked with them; when they laughed or cried, your own tears were a hairs breath away. It is a magical experience to be a part of this work of art. It is a story you never want to end, but you know when the time comes that you cannot hold on to it any longer. I honestly cannot imagine how Erin managed to make every single piece of this book feel so vibrant and alive, yet she executed it perfectly with immeasurable skill and aptitude. There is no possible way for me to describe each individual aspect of this book with the justice it deserves, so all I can say is that I highly implore you to pick it up and give it a chance. Not everybody will enjoy it as irrevocably as I do, but I hope that it touches you in a new yet strangely familiar way nonetheless. The step through the gates that takes you from painted group to bare grass feels heavy. You think, as you walk away from Le Cirque des Reves and into the creeping dawn, that you felt more awake within the confines of the circus. You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is a dream.
Rating: 4.5 Stars These Broken Stars is an absolutely stunning debut. I read this in four hours, unable to even change the repeating playlist on my iPod as my fingers were too occupied, flipping page after page. Ever since reading Sara Creasys spaceopera duology earlier this year, Ive been keeping my fingers crossed that the sciencefiction genre would take the plunge into terraforming planets. Thus, for me, These Broken Stars is both sciencefiction and young adult at their finest. It brings forth a dangerous, mysterious, but thrilling new planet as its setting, all with a backdrop of teenage survivors. I was besotted with this novel from the first chapter itself. These Broken Stars is told in alternating perspectives between Lilac, the rich daughter of the man who founded the galactic empire of our story, and Tarver, the selfmade war hero who rose up from his middleclass status, only to still be considered the lowest of the low among the upperclass society he serves. When Lilac and Tarver meet unexpectedly aboard the Icarus, they think nothing of it; after all, on a ship so huge, what are the chances of them seeing each other again? Quite decent, it seems, for the two find themselves on an escape pod together when the Icarus malfunctions. Against all odds, they wash up on an unknown planet, alive with terraformed plants, but no human life. With only each other to rely on, the two must find a way to survive on the harsh new planet theyve been placed on  or die trying. Although its worldbuilding isnt the most intricate, the world of These Broken Stars is unchartered territory for YA  thankfully so. It sets up an intriguing universe, one with multiple planets and a strict hierarchy. We see this class order in its most brutal form when it comes to Lilac, who is forbidden from all contact with other men, not for any punishment she will receive, but rather for the death they will face. Thus, when Tarver meets Lilac for the first time, she is charmed at his genuine interest in her, though she must quickly push him away. When the two are stuck together on an escape pod, and then on a mysterious planet, their relationship is terse and frosty, with neither of them able to get along. Moreover, burdened by their stereotypes of one another, they are quick to judge and slow to trust. It is this, I feel, that makes These Broken Stars such a spectacular YA novel. While Lilac feels most at control in her society balls, Tarver is in his skin in the dense forest they find themselves in. As a Major, he is used to scouting new and difficult terrain, having lived on many different planets, thus the reversal of power in this situation is interesting to watch. And the reason I mention that this situation is so perfect for the YA age group is because it automatically lends itself to so much growth. As Tarver and Lilac grow accustomed to one another, learning to live with, understand, and even like each other despite their bristly exteriors, they also discover parts of themselves. Lilac, most noticeably, embraces who she really is, underneath her layers of frills, rising to the challenge of surviving and turning into a hardened, but emboldened, young woman. For Tarver, his growth stems from the emotional attachments he finally allows himself to feel, tackling his past demons along with discovering his emotional vulnerabilities. Alongside these immense routes of selfdiscovery, however, is the slow buildup of an equal relationship. Where both Tarver and Lilac are quick to assume the roles in which they are most skilled, they learn to balance the load and the stereotypical stigmas that cling to their economic status fade away with time. Furthermore, the slowburn romance that gradually builds between these two is captivating. Although their relationship starts out with little trust and more than a few lost tempers, it shifts into a strong friendship and from there, the leap to that eventual first kiss is agonizing, but worth it. I was surprised by the depth of emotion I felt for these two strong characters, perseverant in their need to survive, but also in their love for one another. And, surprisingly, I dont cringe at using the word love here  its hardearned and worth it. While These Broken Stars takes place on a different planet altogether, giving rise to its sciencefiction genre labeling, it is, primarily, a survivalist story. Tarver and Lilacs relationship is an entertaining forefront, certainly, but the situations these two find themselves in are written with poise and depth, managing to add layers to both the characters and the plot at the same time. Additionally, there are traces of the paranormal underlying this tale, as mysterious whispers follow Lilac wherever she travels. Yet, though it spans many genres and topics, Kaufmans debut is tightly written, woven with a dual narration that is not only moving, but distinct. If there are any flaws with this story, it is that one or two plot threads are wrapped up a little quickly towards the end. In fact, Id go so far as to say that the full explanations for them remain a little shabby, but to be frank, I wasnt too bothered by this fact. After all, these same plot devices caused my heart to rupture, giving me more than a fair share of emotional turmoil while reading this book, so I was glad to be wellanddone with them after a certain point. Granted, there are a few issues I feel could have been fleshedout a tiiiny bit better, but I have little to complain with a story so flawless. Thus, I feel as if the ending of this novel is, ultimately, adequate, and reads perfectly as a standalone, though sufficiently whetting the appetite for future companion novels from this world. Infused with depth, threedimensional characters, and groundbreaking new ideas, These Broken Stars will likely leave you dazedly pleased and profoundly giddy. I know I still am. A Note on the Cover: I seem to have gone from the mentality that pretty covers equate books I simply have to get my hands on to pretty covers equaling books I really need to run away from. Sadly, beautiful covers have tricked me too often in the past, but thankfully, the cover of These Broken Stars speaks no lies. And, best of all, the cover is totally relevant! Lilac wears an elaborate green dress when she is shipwrecked and has bright red hair, while Tarver wears his usual gear during this novel. Im still reeling from the fact that a YA cover managed to get it right, so lets hope this is a first for many more covers to come! And by that, we all know I mean Im hoping for some more ethnicities to emerge on these covers. Wouldnt that be a surprise? You can read this review and more on my blog, Ivy Book Bindings.
This review, and many more, can be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca. My Thoughts: Often times when a book is so critically acclaimed Im a little hesitant to pick it up because more often than not the book just doesnt live up to the hype created around it. Yes, Ive become a little cynical in my reading. This is not the case with Wonder. Not by a long shot. In fact two words that I initially wrote down after reading the first few chapters of this book were: touching and emotional. Its because of the emotion and message behind this book that Im so excited to share it with you. First of all, Im shocked and more than a little impressed that this book was written by a first time author. I think that a huge part of the success of this book is that Palacio has given Auggie and the five other people who provide the narration truly authentic and believable voices. Auggie is an inspiring, funny and strong main character who will definitely stay with me for a long time. Palacio has created a sympathetic main character in Auggie who is a normal Star Wars loving boy with an extraordinary face who you cant help but root for. Hes got a great support system at home which has instilled a strong sense of self and he uses his humour to deal with other peoples issues with his face. He is exceptional in that he feels normal even though other people have more of an issue with his face. I know Im not an ordinary tenyearold kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary, I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids dont make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids dont get stared at wherever they go. If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that lookaway thing. Heres what I think: the only reason Im not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way. This book could very easily do a tailspin into a very woeful read about bullying. Sure it has its emotional moments but it doesnt have a generally sad feel to it. Its actually a very uplifting read and has a much more simplistic and innocent approach to it that I wasnt expecting. If youre looking for a gritty account of what life is like living with a severe facial deformity then this wont be the book for you. While there is a strong moral message in the book it never felt like Palacio was pontificating or shoving the moral down the readers throat. Its a simple lesson: be kinder than you have to. I would hope that we all realize that we should be nice to everyone even if we dont do it enough but this book clearly shows the reader that the negative effects of looking away or pretending we dont notice someone with a noticeable deformity is just as damaging as saying a mean statement. It was an emotional read at times I even shed a tear or two! but never had a saccharine or overdone feel to it. Its because of the moral message that I think that this book should be read by middle school kids. I honestly think everyone should read it but kids in middle school would get the most out of it because I think it accurately portrays the effects of bullying, of ignoring someone based on their looks and shows how little it takes to just be a friend and uplift someone. To do what is right, not necessarily what is the easiest, or what others think you should do. Those are some pretty big lessons that I think ALL of us need to learn or get a refresher course on. Overall I truly loved this book. I was fully emersed in Auggies world from the beginning to the end and found it to be a very touching read. The story is told by these six characters with the use of short chapters that really helped to keep the pace moving. But what really stood out with me is the ease and success that Palacio had using various points of view  Auggie and FIVE others  to tell the story. This could have been a literary train wreck with the number of POVs but it was done extremely well giving the reader insight into those around Auggie and how he and they experienced things differently. I especially loved his sister, Vias, point of view and her conflicting feelings towards her brother and all of the attention he gets from their parents. She adores her brother but the effects of his facial deformity, his numerous surgeries and how others react to him greatly influences her life. Palacio also shows how other people in Auggies life, namely Jack and Summer, deal with other insensitive and downright cruel people who judge them for hanging out with Auggie. I did have a couple of small criticisms about the book. One thing that did strike me as not quite right were the language and issues that these Grade 5 kids had to deal with. As a mom to kids in Grade 4, 6 and 8 Id like to think that I have a handle on the voice and development of tweens. Based on that experience with my Small Humans I think that the social issues that were dealt with in the book are more in middle school Grades 68 than in an elementary school setting. I dont think that Grade 5 students are nearly as developmentally advanced as Jack, Auggie, Summer etc were portrayed in the book. I think having the kids be in Grade 7 would have been a more realistic age where they would have experienced the peer and social pressures dealt with in this book. My other issue with the book is that perhaps because it had a lighter feel to it the ending was also more uplifting and a little too tidy for my liking. The bad guy got his comeuppance and the good guys all rode off into the sunset. These are small beefs about the book wee moos, if you like but they were noticeable and may bother some readers who were hoping for an edgy ending. Overall, I loved this book and found Wonder to be truly wonderful. I adore the moral of the book that encourages people to be kinder than necessary and that people have not only the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness. Hopefully, after reading this book people will choose to be more respectful and kinder to others even when its not convenient for them or when it makes them feel uncomfortable. To give others dignity. Imagine the kind of world wed have if we all did that. Kinder than is necessary. Because its not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed. Highly recommended. My Rating: 4.55 stars
Okay. Wow. Where to start. I guess the first thing to mention is the length of this review. If youre familiar with my site at all then youll already know that each of my reviews has the same number of words as the book has pages, which means this is going to be a 1,328 word whopper. Explaining this took up less than 10 of my word count. The Stand is Stephen Kings most epic book, at least in terms of its overall word count. At almost half a million words, its 50,000 words longer than It, its closest competitor. I havent read It yet, and the only time Ive come close to this length was with Under the Dome, which I also gave five stars to. But if anything, I liked this book better. Its almost like a play, with the action occurring across three acts. I cant go into too much detail about the later acts, because that will give too much away, but I can at least touch on various elements of the story line. Essentially, its a great American plague story, following the events that unfold after a super flu wipes out 99.8 of the worlds population. The initial third of the book  the first act  deals with the initial aftermath, and its almost like a novel version of a disaster movie. Quite simply, its fricken awesome. This also helps to set up the back stories of the primary characters, and while it might seem a little confusing from time to time to begin with, its worth sticking to. Thats because we get to see to them what happens after the initial onslaught of the flu, and that largely forms the basis of Acts II and III. Thats joined by a classic story of good versus evil, with iconic, deitylike figures on both the sides of good and evil, whether were talking about Mother Abigail or the Walkin Dude. As always, Kings characterisation is top notch, and despite the fact that there are a couple of dozen key players that youll want to keep your eye on, its not difficult to understand whos who and whats happening. Even the minor characters are well thought out, with their own little back stories that help to explain their actions, especially once they start to get erratic once the pull is felt between the sides of good and evil. Honestly, I find it hard to fault The Stand. Oh, sure, its a long old read, but I enjoyed it so much that I powered through the whole thing in a week or so. It can be difficult to hold, unwieldy and a pain in the ass to carry around. But its also hugely rewarding, and one of my favourite reads in the last eighteen months or so. Its got that Stephen King magic to it, and its hard not to get absorbed in his realistic depiction of the end of the world. Even the little things have been thought about. For example, after the initial wave of deaths, theres a smaller wave in which a reasonably sized percentage of the remaining population manages to kill itself. Junkies taking too many drugs. People having heart attacks with no emergency services to treat them. One woman accidentally locks herself in a refrigeration unit that only opens from the outside. And another interesting aspect was the odds of survival for the human race into the future  what about unborn babies? If immunity to the super flu isnt genetic, then will newborn babies die when they leave the room? And will they even last that long? Those are questions that plague Fran, one of the books good guys gals?. Other characters include minor celebrity Larry Underwood, whos just had his first hit record, a retard boy called Tom Cullen whos almost an idiot savant, and a deaf mute called Nick, who was my favourite. Nick can lip read and communicate by writing little notes down, and it was great to see that represented  especially because he was awesome. Now, Ive read perhaps half of Kings bibliography by now, and Im planning on working my way through the rest of it. I cant quite decide whether this is my favourite book so far  I think it might be, but I dont know if I want to commit myself. There are just so many other books by the same author. What I will say, though, is that Id recommend this ahead of the Dark Tower series, even though I highly recommend that too. Itll take you less time overall, and its arguably faster paced and a little more gripping. Slightly over five hundred words to go. You see how it can start to feel a little bit like running a marathon? Just looking at the length of the review should give you a good idea of what youre getting into. Dont even attempt it unless you know that you can stick with a long book without getting bored and trying to read something else. The last thing you want is to sink into a reading slump, especially when youve got a book this good in your hands, ready for you to crack on with it. Its also interesting to note how long it took King to write it  thirteen years, according to the dates that he included at the end, as is his custom. The funny thing about that is that the book itself, though epic, takes place during just a fraction of that. I also found it interesting that King created a disease that he himself would almost certainly have died of, if it had actually happened. It has some similarities with the zombie novel, except that at least you can defend yourself against a zombie. But if youre not immune to the superflu, theres nothing you can do. You might as well just lie in bed and wait to die. And theres something else. Now, this might seem like a minor detail, but those minor details start to add up when you commit to a book as long as this. One of the strengths of this book is the way that King not only captures the initial panic as the virus spreads but also nails the aftermath, when vehicles are abandoned, corpses start to rot in the cities and anyone can have any damn thing they want, just by smashing a shops windows. Overall then, The Stand is just one of those books that makes literature itself all the richer simply by the fact of its existence. Its a long old read, all right, but its totally worth reading all the same. Ive never read a book thats quite like this, and while it gave me even more respect for Stephen King, its even more notable for just blowing my mind and making me realise that my idea of what a book is was incomplete. You dont realise that something like this exists until youre forced to confront it. Id been putting off starting The Stand for a while, but now that Ive finished it, Im not sure what the fuss was about. In fact, I found myself wishing that it would continue, and feeling as though I could have read a little more of it. Its rare for that to happen to begin with, and for it to happen like this is not just surprising  its almost unbelievable. So if you think you can handle the kind of read that might just change your life, but that will take up a chunk of your time to get through it, you cant do much better than this. And better still, I cant see something like this ever being repeated  as an author myself, I have no choice but to look at it, hold my hands up and say, I have no idea how he did it.
I want to start off by stating that it is very important that you start this series with The Siren if you havent already done so. Though this book is a prequel to the first 4 books, please be aware that The Saint is book 5 of The Original Sinners series. Though this review is spoilerfree pertaining to The Saint, there may be spoilers for those who have not read the previous books. Consider yourself warned. : For the series reading order click here. Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named Eleanor who had secrets she wanted to keep... Before I started this book, I was apprehensive about how the story would be told. If youve read the first four books, youll know that we get glimpses of past events via flashbacks throughout the Red Years books 14. Going in, I thought I knew what to expect because The White Years books 58 were meant to fill us in on what life was like back in the day with Nora and crew. With that in mind, I had a little trepidation about reading a book highlighting Noras virginal years, through the eyes of young Nora. I was worried that Id come away from reading this book with a severe case of blue balls as we know from The Red Years, Nora and Soren dont get romantically involved until she is older, and a desire to be back in the present to see what the gang is up to now from where The Mistress left off. Now, I wish I can go back and slap myself in the face for ever thinking any of those things. Shame on me. True to form, Tiffany knocked it out of the park with this book. It exceeded all my expectations, and once again, the bar was raised when it comes to her storytelling ability. I absolutely LOVE the format in which The Saint is written. The book opens up in the present, and then we are transported to the past as it the events are recounted by presentday Nora. Think of it as a bedtime story that is told to you as you get tucked into bed with a little kinklaced nightcap. Best storytime EVER! Just like the books that preceded this one, the story is told in Third Person POV. The narration bounces back and forth from the present and the past, and even though I thoughtI wouldnt been as keen on learning what the earlier years were like through the eyes of Young Nora, I came to realize that younger Nora was just as compelling as the more mature Nora weve come to know and love. She was just as snarky, sarcastic, bold, vulgar, and unapologetic as always. This book wasnt just about filling in the gaps, or getting better acquainted with her and Sorens relationship its about falling in love by truly using your heart, your mind, and your soul. I wasnt only captivated by the romantic aspects of Soren and Noras relationship, but also by the development of their platonic relationship as well. There were moments that my I had to clutch my pearls as my heart swooned out of control by Sorens words: Now, dont get me wrong, this is not your average girlmeetsboy romantic tale. As we know from the previous books, Nora and Sorens relationship is unconventional in every way possible. In The Saint, we get a firsthand look at all of the obstacles they had to overcome prior to being able to be together. Nora had to learn to crawl before she could walk, and Soren was there to take her through the motions, and to put things in perspective. If you couldnt tell from all my gushing, I was blown away by the writing in this book. Tiffany Reisz is truly a wordsmith. Her stories are powerful, enthralling, and all encompassing. Every word, every scene, every Psalm  Proverb, every character, and even every collar has a purpose in her books. She leaves no stone left unturned with her plot. Tiffanys writing goes beyond being just words on a page that you are meant to read with your eyes, and process with your mind. Her words leap out at you, and tugs at your heart, to the point where they are meant to be felt with your heart. While reading The Saint, I felt the love, the desire, the fear, the indignation, the hope, the heartache, the wonder, and the happiness. I laughed, I swooned, and I overheated. There were even some parts in the book that I would feel a wide array of emotions all at once. For example: My definition of foreplay is usually classified as assault. Obviously you and I are reading different dictionaries. You dont seem to understand the gravity of this situation. I am a sadist. I cannot escape that. My feels after I read that: amusement, fascination, uncertainty, and if Im being honest, even a little excitement, and fullon anticipation. I mean, when it comes to Soren, Im all in. To know Soren is to love him...and whats a little sadism amongst friends? Amirite? Black sheets, anyone? When you pick up your copy of The Saint, throw out any preconceived notions that you think you may have about what you think is going to happen in this book. Yes, its primarily about Nora and Soren, but its so much more. Yes, theres debauchery, theres kink, there are cameos from some of our favorite characters, as well as some new faces. There are plot twists and turns, and as even a little mindfckery in the mix... You have fallen in love with the king of all the mindfuckers. Mindfucking? Is that when you stick it in her ear? Not quite. Its when I stick it in her brain. Bottom line: I adored this book. Bottom line: Soren is officially my alltime favorite literary sadist, and Nora is one of my alltime favorite characters. Bottom line: With every new book in this series, I find myself more and more converted by the gospel of Tiffanys writing. Her books completely alter your conventional aka Vanilla views of love and life. I wish there were more stars I could give this book. This was one of my top reads of 2014. I cant wait to get my hands on the audiobook so that I can relive this story all over again. Add The Saint to Your TBR: Add The Saint to Your Collection: Want a sneak peek of The Saint?

Somewhere in England a madman, hellbent on revenge, is watching, waiting, biding his time and building his armies. In hiding, he anticipates their every move. Always just one step ahead. Pulling the strings. Calling the shots. He has a plan. He set a trap. And all he has to do is wait. But his patience is not infinite. And time is running out... ... for Charlotte to track him down and prove to everyone once and for all that shes capable of running the Institute. ... for Tessa to find answers about where she comes from and who she really is, so she can discover where she truly belongs. ... for Will to break free from the demons of his past and to reveal his secrets before he loses everything. ... for Jem to find a cure before its too late for him to find happiness and to give his heart to someone he loves.  Clockwork Prince is the highly anticipated, incredibly imaginative, enthralling and heartbreaking sequel to Clockwork Angel in Cassandra Clares The Infernal Devices series. The prologue will immediately draw readers back into the authors richly developed and magical world of Shadow Hunters, Downworlders and Mundanes. Returning them to a Victorian London that keeps its secrets hidden amidst the shadows of its crowded and sootcovered alleyways. Leadership of the Institute is being called into question and Charlotte will have to prove to Consul Wayland and the rest of the Clave that she should continue to run it. The Magister remains on the loose, plotting his revenge and waiting for just the right time to send in his clockwork army. Tessa is still desperate for answers to questions that it seems only the Magister knows. And Will is struggling to keep his secrets, the burden of which is becoming almost too much to bear. In this suspenseful and gripping story, every answer only seems to lead to more questions. Every chapter offers a new surprise. And as more and more secrets are revealed, discoveries are made, hidden motivations are uncovered and a shocking betrayal comes to light, readers will be left stunned and heartbroken and anxious for more. Cassandra Clares writing has such a beautiful cadence and flow. It allows readers to easily get pulled into her stories, and Clockwork Prince is no exception. And while it may appear to be lengthy, at approximately five hundred pages, it is a surprisingly quick and immensely enjoyable read. While the world she creates in this series is very different from the one in The Mortal Instruments, the elements that are the same really connect the two  from a shared history and common ancestors to characters who survive the passage of time to appear in both series. And from the Shadow Hunters to the Silent Brothers, from the Clave to the Institutes, both series have a foundation that is exceptionally detailed, incredibly exciting and much beloved to fans. Her characters in Clockwork Prince are easily as lovable as those in her other series, if not more so. Tessa is beautiful, brave, loyal, kindhearted, intelligent and inquisitive. Jem is handsome, patient, trustworthy, fiercely loyal and incredibly easygoing. Magnus is just as charming and funny and endearing as he is over a century later in The Mortal Instruments. And then theres Will. Will is complicated. Hes temperamental, sarcastic, startlingly goodlooking, irresistibly sexy, mysterious, secretive, fiercely loyal to his parabatai Jem, at times incredibly cruel and at others unbelievably kind. Without a doubt, Clockwork Prince is a must read that will engage readers and instantly transport them back in time to this story set in the Victorian Era that is a wonderful mix of paranormal, steampunk, action, mystery and suspense, and has at its heart a love story. On a personal note: What an amazing and heartbreaking book this was. I cant believe I have to wait for an entire year to get my hands on Clockwork Princess. Because, not only do I want to know what happens next, I really want to know who the clockwork princess is! There are just so many questions that are left unanswered at the end of Clockwork Prince. So many different directions this story can take. I do not have a single clue  not one  about where the author plans on going. And its killing me. Just killing me. Sure, this may not be considered a book with a cliffhanger ending, or at least not one that leaves you totally suspended in midair. But even if Im not left hanging, a lot of things are. Or if not hanging, then certainly openended. With way too many possibilities for things to go wrong... or even more wrong than they already have. And not many of these possibilities seem like theyll have happy endings, or at least endings Ill be happy with. But I definitely remain hopeful. I mean, just look at Clary and Jace in City of Glass. I love, love, love, love, love just how much Will there is in this story. And Magnus, though I could always use more Magnus. While I am a huge Jem fan, I tend to lean toward the bad boy or at least the supersarcastic boy who pretends not to care about anyone or anything, but sorta does. I refuse to be spoilery so I will try not to talk too much about any of the characters, but so much happens with them in this story. And while it doesnt always feel like a lot is going on, a lot is actually going on. There is less of an emphasis on the steampunk aspects in this book, but theyre not left out entirely. And there is a reason why they take a back seat and thats because a large part of this story is on certain other characters who have been keeping secrets. I really can say no more. Tessa is just as lovable as I remembered her from the first book in the series. Shes a book lover  which already makes her a favorite  and shes clever and so goodhearted. But she does show another side to her personality in this book. One that makes me like her even more. Ive always been a huge Jem fan, though Will is still my number one. And the author shows a lot more of the yumminess of Jem in this book, which makes the choice between the two boys a little more difficult. But Will.... Oh Will. There is just so much Id love to say about Will right about now. If I only could.... I will just say that he is definitely in this book. A lot. Which made me a very, very happy girl... mostly.... And that he is just as maddeningly and infuriatingly sexy as ever. And yes, I was devastated about certain turns of events. The author took my heart and crushed it and I dont know quite how Ill recover. And I just cant see how it can be repaired in the next book. Maybe Ill need a clockwork one. I think I preordered every single version of this book. I dont want to miss out on any of the extras that come with it. And I am hoping theyll reveal just a little more about what I can anticipate in Clockwork Princess which seems just so very far away right now. I am such a huge fan of both series and after reading Clockwork Prince, I think I might love them equally. Cassandra Clares writing is always magical and the worlds she creates are so elaborate and captivating and exciting, and they make me want to get lost in them again and again. Fortunately City of Lost Souls will be out in May to help break up the long, long wait for the next book in The Infernal Devices series. And so the countdown begins....
May contain spoilers! Read at your own risk! I freaking love the cover! squee I mean look at it! Teal is by no means my favorite colour but this cover is so freaking gorgeous! Oh poo, we dont have Clockwork Princess translated in Romanian yet. . The addition of Sophies point of view I found really cute :3 Is it just me or does Cassandra Clare have a very bad habit of interrupting people when they are in the process of saying something really, really important? It stuck out like a sore thumb most of the times. Sidenote: Cassandra Clares similes are irking to a lot of readers, but they are more accessible and more easy to ignore in the Romanian translation. Lucky me :D This time Tessa reads more like a teenager than she did in Clockwork Angel, which is all the more irking with her constant descriptions of Wills breathtaking beauty. Really, Tessa, really I get it! Hes fucking Adonis in your eyes! You dont need to reiterate that once every 57 pages! I am seriously not content with this book emphasizing so much on the romance aspect. I found it cute at times, sappy a fair amount of the time and even though it was relevant to the characters I did not find it relevant to the plot. It seemed to me that the only people who were in fact interested in furthering the plot were Charlotte and Will surprisingly enough. I have to rectify my opinion when it comes to Will. When hes childish and sarcastic, goofing around in, my mind he is a teenager acting like a child  a perverted one nonetheless, that part with the indecent pieces of toast was hilarious  earns him a 13 year old aspect in my mind, sarcasm mode takes him closer to his actual age however as when he acts like a jerk and says really, really mean things he reads like a 25ish year old stuck up prick and I dont like him like that because I cant empathize with him. As a reader I want to empathize with the character and while I do understand his reason for rebuking people, his way of doing it is offputting, to say the least. When he is mean I cannot feel sorry for him because he doesnt let me. Only when displays himself as a reasonable and understanding person do I truly feel sorry for him. Interesting to put it mildly almost sex scene between Jem and Tessa. I actually did not expect her to lose her control like that, then again she is a hormone filled teenager, with or without the Victorian setting, makes no freaking difference ;P The point where they get interrupted by Tessa knocking Jems drug box off the cupboard I like to call it the drugblock wink wink nudge nudge. In my opinion her first kiss with Jem has a better build up than that with Will and I am saying this because, for once, Jem and Tessa actually have chemistry: they talk they joke, they share opinions and worries, they complement each other he even compliments her in mandarin, which I found cute :3. Their first kiss that ofc turned rapidly in the course of 3 whole pages of description from mere embraces to really naughty touches ;  is more plausible. I actually buy the fact that they love each other and want to go further, if may. Even as I was nearing the end of this second book in the Infernal Devices trilogy I could not get myself to believe Tessa and Wills romance. As I said in my review for the Hunger Games I am not contesting the boys feelings towards the girl, but those of the girl towards the boy. If we strip away all the excess descriptions about him, we are left with Tessa being attracted to Wills good looks and maybe being interested in him because of his dark past. In my opinion, if will would have had a much plainer physical aspect, she probably would not have been so obsessed with him, the way she is now. At one point he was lying naked on a bed covered with a merely a blanket, but in my mind that thought did not matter. The fact that his back was pierced by tens of metal shards and Tessa was admiring how handsome he was, while he was IN AGONY made me shout out loud: TESSA, YOU FUCKING IDIOT! Hes clenching his teeth in pain and youre thinking about how wonderful his body is?!?!?! WTF! Oh well, just goes to show how superficial Tessa can be. Then again she is a teenage girl, no one can tell her not to fall in love with a boy because of his looks, Ive certainly done that, but putting this first and foremost after, oh lets say, fucking body horror, is something I cannot swallow without cynicism. Not much really happens in this book aside from a council meeting, a trip to the York Institute, a masquerade ball, a confrontation with Tessas brother, o confrontation with Benedict Lightwood and the end was another council meeting. Fairly plain plotline. What can I say about the ending? I understand the reasoning behind why Jem asks Tessa to marry her, though I cant go past the idea that its too freaking sudden. Theyve barely known each other for like 2 months . Will finding out he was not cursed by the demon after all was no surprise to me, because I read spoilers about it, but what interested me was what he did with this new found information. Naturally, after he finds out that he was free all along he starts brooding about it and I thought to myself: Well Hell, heres where the teen romance crap starts taking full effect previously it was Tessa and Will thinking about their love for each other  now they can express it in words!. Surely enough I was not wrong, what does Will do the first thing hes alone with Tessa? He forces himself upon her, smothering her with kisses and tells Tessa, with a lot of angsting, that he loves her. Ofc, the news that Tessa is engaged to Jem is a heavy blow for him. The scene had ridiculous amounts of melodrama in it, to the point I think I rolled my eyes everytime Tessa and Will opened their mouths to say something. However, this scene proved something about these two characters. 1. Will is really selfish and selfcentered. Now that he is free to love he assumes that he is the one entitled to have Tessa and they can just simply tell Jem that the engagement was a misunderstanding and that Tessa wants to be with him. This goes to show that Will DOES NOT care about Jem, whether hes happy or not. But Tessa does and she is right to tell him that she is going through with the wedding. Even though at the end shes crying like a little bitch XD. and 2. Tessa doesnt know what she want. She is very indecisive. Do I love the mysterious and breathtakingly handsome William Herondale? Or do I love the really sweet and kindhearted James Carstairs? Oh decisions, decisions. Yes, shes a teen and yes she can love both of them. But seriously, girl, make up your damn MIND! Even though I had a lot of gripes about The Clockwork Prince, I will only take out one star. Because I like the world building and the story so much. :D Lets Rate This  8.1  10 Setting and Atmosphere  8 Plot  8 Main Characters  8 Secondary Characters  8 Antagonists  7 Writing  9 Enjoyability  9 Next up it probably wont be Clockwork Princess, so time to start the Mortal Instruments series. . Wish me luck and I hope to not make too many comparisons to The Infernal Devices as I am reading it and just enjoy it on its own. Reviews for the Infernal Devices trilogy: Clockwork Angel Clockwork Prince Clockwork Princess My other reviews :D
Originally posted on Small Review Lets be honest here I initially picked up this series because I thought the guy on the cover looked hot. Yes, that IS how I select my books. Mostly. His smaller companion on the right wasnt too bad either, but, really, it was that rugged man on the left with, count them, three swords that caught my eye. Oh, and it was also billed as an epic fantasy series that promised battles, thieves, court intrigue, mercenaries, assassinations, questing, conspiracy and all that good stuff. So that caught my attention, too. Did it live up? Did it ever! My gosh, this is one of those Leave Me Babbling books where its just too good to not insert squees between mostlyincoherent gushing. This is definitely the type of series that gets better as it goes along. I finished the first book which ends pretty well as a standalone and a tiny part of me considered moving on to something else because, while I totally loved it, the characters felt a tiny bit...distant? Not entirely alive? They were great, but, you know me, Im a character girl and these characters were maybe 90 of the way there. But I didnt wait and I dont recommend doing anything silly like waiting. Pick up the next book in the series as soon as you finish the first added convenience, theyre sold as omnibus editions! So the next book is already in your hands!. I did that, and Im so glad I did that because the characters totally grew on me. Also, all those things about the plot that I thought were plain old surface level fantasy fare turned out to be twisty turny stuff that took on a whole new level of meaning once I started connecting all the dots later on. Oh Hadrian And that guy on the cover? He totally lived up! Talk about swoon fest. It wasnt the type of swooning where he had sizzling romantic scenes cause, honestly, his ultimate love declaration scene was kinda embarrassingtotally cute, but also totally embarrassing. BUT, yay for slow burn romance!. No, I swooned because of the type of man he is, which is a MANLY man. Not alpha man, but more like knight paragon kinda man. Theres even this scene in, oh, book five? Four? Six? Something like that, where hes pretending to be a knight and the real knights sneer at him because hes all common and stuff but its Hadrian who actually embodies all the qualities of nobleness, steadfastness, honor, virtue, kindness, humility, etc. and the real knights are just big meanies. Its all very heavy handed, but its also SO TRUE that I didnt mind because by that point I was already donning my Hadrian cheerleading outfit and breaking out the pom poms every chance I got. Ok fine, do you prefer the rogue wounded bad boy with a hidden tenderness? Well lucky you, thats the little guy on the cover. Dont worry, hes not little in, erm, real life? Book life? Whatever, the cover is totally miscast, because Royce is a badass assassin who does BAD things to even badder people and doesnt bat an eye. BUT, he has a notsosecret relationship that makes him melt into a puddle of total besotted mush. Also, hes allowed himself to stop being so closed off and let Hadrian in as his best pal. So you know what that means, right? LOTS of brothersinarms bonding! I LOVE brothersinarms bonding. Its fantastic. They do all sorts of cool things like pulling off amazing thefts that no one else could do or fighting in battles or engaging in secret missions and quests and bantering all the while because they have a kind of platonic man version of the hateturnedlove relationship going on that adds about a bizillion points to everything. Did I say quests and battles? YES! Also, court conflict and intrigue, assassinations and not just by Royces hand, mysteries, deposing kings, sieges, explosions, magic, duels, scary creatures, ship voyages, jungle battles, charming street urchins, villainous political factions, pretender queens, romances, kick butt women TOTAL kick butt women!, double crosses, misdirection, and ALL sorts of other fabulous stuff. Its pretty much an explosion of everything I want, all packaged in three, ok, BIG books but all with swoony covers. And a note on that size? I WANT MORE. Seriously. These books arent long enough. Sure, theyre LONG. I consider anything over 300 pages a LONG book, and there are six books here, each well over 300 pages. And yet, Im not satisfied. Oh sure, everything wraps up fine, in the end. But Im not ready to let go of these characters or this world. I think I read everything in a little over a month and a half, and it only took that long because halfway through I realized I loved it so much I needed to start making it last. Otherwise, this was the kind of series where my main motivation for waking up in the morning was so I could start reading and it was only my super strict fear of lying that kept me from using a coveted sick day to call out of work so I wouldnt have to stop reading. Ive only really mentioned Hadrian and Royce, but this is an epic fantasy, so you know theres a requisite character guide because there are so many side characters there are also maps, obviously. And, being a more traditional epic fantasy, a lot of those side characters get narrative time so I was able to fall in love with them even more. Id start listing my favorites other than the obvious but Id end up with basically the character guide, and that thing is PAGES long. So Im not even going to try. Ill just say that by the end of the series, all the characters felt like real people and, months later, Im STILL not ready to let them go. The nearnonstop action interspersed with character growth and tense peril helped make the pages fly by, too. I guess EVERYTHING these days I feel so jaded lately. I used to be super dense and never guess endings and I loved that because who needs to be a smarty pants if it ruins the surprise? But lately Ive been guessing all the endings and thats just no fun. But not with this series! I think Ive now firmly cemented my status as loony book lady in my new jobs library because I read this series during my lunch breaks there and I swear I tried, but I couldnt stop myself from exclaiming out loud and otherwise talking to my books. I mean, its just, all this STUFF happened! And I didnt see ANY of it coming! It was amazing! There were all these twists and turns and I wasnt expecting any of it! Oh my, oh my gosh, NO NO NO, YES YES YES!! and similar phrases made up my more regular outbursts. Also, I would just periodically exclaim, My gosh I LOVE this series! for no reason in particular other than just the general accumulation of awesomeness that I couldnt contain in nonverbal ways anymore. At one point a student even asked me if I was ok. Thankfully she must have been a reader herself because after I sputtered out a, yeah, Im fine, its just, my book she just nodded kind of knowingly and smiled. So shes probably totally a kindred spirit reader. Or she thinks Im nuts. Bottom line Do you love fantasy series? Brothers in arms? Romance? Action? Peril? Mystery? Court intrigue? Quests? Intriguing characters? Double crosses? Unexpected twists? Well, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!? Michael J. Sullivan, welcome to my autobuy list. Explanation of rating system: Star Rating Key Originally posted on Small Review
More reviews on my blog, Exploring Pages. I closed my eyes only to open them once more, and make sure it was all still there  the riot of stars above me, this whole other world existing just out of reach.  Morgan Matson, Since Youve Been Gone Stop whatever you are doing. Drop it, because I have to convince you to read Since Youve Been Gone. This book is wonderful. It met all my expectations and surprised me above it all. Despite some events further on in the book, I can guarantee that this is an ultimate happy pill. I cannot bring myself to believe how much I adored the plot. Despite the involvement of a list with things to do, it never felt like she was just doing things to eventually cross them off. From the beginning already, theres a nice flow which continues throughout the book. With every task she completes, Emily is pushed out of her comfort zone, bit by bit. The tasks on the list itself were nothing like you would find on a regular bucket list. I was so intrigued to learn about some of the backstories behind certain tasks. There was no way that a list of Sloane would just contain tasks which made no sense. I loved how the crossing off the list went. There are times when a task is more difficult than expected, and therefore always adds a nice twist to the story. Emily is a protagonist close to my heart. Shes the typical flawed teenager, and because of that, incredibly relatable. Shes completely normal, yet she definitely has a unique touch that makes her so wonderful. She makes smart and realistic choices, even though they dont seem great at times. Everything she does is never out of character, and I love her for that. She developed so much during the book its almost impossible at the end of the book to compare her to the girl she was before. I didnt think this would be a comingofage story, but it is, and a beautiful one too. When it comes to the relatability of Emilys character, it surprised me in more ways than I imagined. Not only her personality, but also her friendship with Sloane has something to do with it. I practically recognized their friendship, since I have a similar one. That friendship one has with the prettier and more popular girl, the girl you almost look up to and admires her spontaneous behavior. The friendship where youre known as the friend of that girl. Usually this is the type of relationships that doesnt have a great impact on the other girl, and causes side effects. That automatically brings me to another thing I loved so much about Since Youve Been Gone: the fact that the book managed to portray it in the way I know it. She brings out the best in you. Shes always up for an adventure to remember, and therefore creates a friendship you wont let go of. Writing my thoughts down about Sloane made me wonder if I actually liked her character in the story. At first I would have compared it to a lovehate relationship. Because she is the popular girl with the blonde hair and perfect skin, she came across as a Mary Sue in the first flashbacks. It wasnt until more flashbacks made their appearance and I saw her character develop, I was beginning to have my doubts. In the end everything was cleared up for me. Turns out the Mary Sue is just a normal girl with her everyday problems and flaws. Matson managed to never leave me unsurprised, thats for sure. Its rare occasion when all the characters in a book are nothing but lovable. Because of Sloanes sudden disappearance, Emily bonds throughout the book with some very fantastic characters. To start off with Collins, theres nothing bad to be said about the guy. He acts the way his environment wants him to, or at least what he thinks is expected of him. All the way through its obvious that the imagine he holds is nothing but just an image, and that theres something more beyond. Its not always clear, but he also goes through changes which become visible at the end. He was a wonderful character who made me smile and laugh from beginning to end, and always brings along a happy atmosphere. Moving onto Dawn, I was immediately intrigued when she made her first appearance. From that moment on, it was pretty clear that she would be there for Emily. Not only to cross off the list, but also as a friend. One she really needed at that time. Even though both Collins and Dawn were just side characters, they wont be forgotten very easily. Oh, the romance. If I had to describe it in three words, Im one hundred percent sure those would be to swoon for. It was everything I would have wished for. While it actually is a forbidden romance due a certain girlfriend, I couldnt help but ship Emily and Frank. They are adorable together. Not only Emily, but also I was one who fell hard for Frank Porter. As adorable and awkward as he is, he always managed to put a grin on my face. From the beginning he volunteers to help Emily with her list. You see their friendship growing, and eventually resulting into something more, bringing along a lot of drama, guilt and tears. The chemistry between the two was undeniable, even though both of them are too shy to see it at first. Thumbs up for a youngadult novel where the parents are actually involved in the life of the main character. Not a sign of parents who are either depressed, dead or normal but barely talk to their children. The fact that her parents were known play writers was the cherry on top. I loved their influence on the story, which led to a certain scene where I found myself laughing, grinning and swooning like an idiot. In a well ordered universe, I would have ready to leave these wonderful characters behind. Im not ready. Im craving for a sequel, even if its just a novella. I want to know what happens after the somewhat happy end. I want to learn about possible future adventures. Just the combination of a simple but highlyentertaining plot, characters youll get to love and a romance youll soon enough find yourself rooting for creates an outstanding and perfect summer novel.
Originally posted on City of Books Aaaahhh, this book! Im still not over how amazing it is. It was even better than what I expected, which is saying something because I already had high expectations based on the premise and synopsis. Also, this beauty is Evelyn Skyes debut novel, which blows my mind! Im so, so impressed by this. The Crowns Game is set in 19th century Russia. Im quite fascinated by Russian history, and though most of my knowledge is from around and after the Bolshevik Revolution, its clear that several aspects of this book are historically accurate. Reading this made me feel like I was right there in Imperial Russia! The writing is phenomenal, and the descriptions beautiful. I havent read any YA books so deeply embedded in Russian history, so I really loved this one. Vika is an enchanterintraining, living with her father on a small island away from the city. Vika has been told by her father her whole life that she will one day become the Imperial Enchanter, and so she needs to be strong enough to protect the tsar. But her life is turned upside down when she discovers that there is, in fact, another enchanter. It is exceedingly rare to have two in the same generation, but Vika and Nikolai are both enchanters prepared to do whatever it takes to become the Imperial Enchanter. They have to take part in the Crowns Game, a series of magical battles ending with the death of one enchanter, thereby declaring a winner. But can either of the young enchanters actually find it in them to kill the other? Well, it doesnt really matter because they dont have a choice. I have so much to say about this book. But Ill start with the characters. I adored all three of them! Vika is easy to like, and shes powerful as hell. I loved seeing her perform her magic to impress the tsar. Shes wild and bold and quite terrifying at times, but she can also be kind and gentle, and she cares so much for her father and the people shes grown up around. Nikolai was another fantastic character. The book is told in third person and we get his perspective too, thankfully. He, unlike Vika, has known that there was another enchanter, and so hes more prepared. But his power is different from Vikas, and he has to learn to use his strengths against hers. Nikolai was difficult to figure out at first  hes kind of an enigma. We get to know more about him later on, though, and Im now fascinated by him. He begins to fall for Vika soon into the Game, and it was heartbreaking to see him torn between his feelings for her and his desire to win the Game. I was surprised by how quickly the two of them got with the program regarding the Game  the competition as well as the trying to kill the opponent thing. Vika especially  she didnt seem like the type to do that. The two of them have five turns, and with each turn at least in the beginning, they would attempt to get rid of the other. It was amusing, in a sense, but also kind of weird because the darkness didnt feel like part of their characters. But I loved that we got to see them use magic, and also exactly how they used it. In so many YA fantasies, the plots are focused on the journey or the romance or politics of some sort, and that bothers me because its fantasy, can we please see some magic? Well, in this book, we see magic  lots of it! Its incredible, and I just drank it all in. Another very important character I forgot to mention  Pasha! Hes the tsarevich, the heir to the throne. And also Nikolais best friend. The two of them hang out in the city at night Pasha having snuck out of the palace in disguise, and they share everything. Well, almost everything. Pasha has no idea about the Game or that Nikolai is an enchanter, but they both know Vika and they both fall for her. I really loved Pasha, especially midway through the book. Hes sweet and kind and adventurous, and I loved that hes nothing like his father or his sister. Also, I sympathized with him a lot, since his father and his best friend are hiding something so big from him, and even Vika is involved, but Pashas kept in the dark. I wont say any more about him, because spoilers. I really really want to, though! Sigh. There are so many twists and turns and shocks in this book! I almost couldnt keep up. I had no idea when any of them would pop up, so this really was a roller coaster of a book. The Game was intense, and there are things happening outside the game as well that are huge. And then theres the constant conflicting feelings between Vika and Nikolai. Romance isnt a big part of the plot  in fact, its barely existent. But theres definitely romantic tension, and dont worry  no love triangle. Not in my eyes, anyway. Vika and Nikolai are clearly drawn to one another, and not just because of their magic. Its interesting to see how that worked out considering theyre pitted against each other from the moment they officially met. Okay Ill stop now, but let me tell you this  if you miss out on reading this book, you will regret it. I promise you that. The Crowns Game is one of my favourite YA books not just this year, but ever. And though that cruel, cruel cliffhanger of an ending just about killed me, I still urge everyone to read it. Evelyn Skye has done a fantastic job with this book, and Im already desperate to get the sequel in my hands. Thank you to HarperCollins for providing me with an eARC for review
 spoiler alert  Hello guys Maria here and today I am going to be discussing A Darker Shade of Magic by VE Schwab. This book is one of her adult novels and I certainly enjoyed it. The only problem I have really had with this book was that there was a lot world building and that caused the book to drag a little bit. Anyway lets get to the plot shall we? Plot: The Main Character, Kell, is a blood magician called a Alarni and he is the second to last of his kind. His character is allowed to go to different dimensions and communicate with the monarchy at each one of them. There is Grey London, which is kind of like the normal London very grey and lacking of magic. There is Red London which has a lot of magical things surrounding it and its people know magic. Then there is White London which has people struggling to survive because theyre constantly at war with each other. Certainly not least there is Black London which was so corrupted by magic it was destroyed. Kell was lucky enough to be adopted by the king and queen of Red London, so he is counted as a prince. However there is one thing about Kell that makes flawed, he likes collecting things from other Londons and bringing them back with him. This is a problem because it is technically illegal to do something like that in this world. One day a woman gives Kell something that he didnt really want but ended up taking anyway, causing this whole story to flip upside down. With the help of the spunky and courageous Delilah Bard, they will destroy this evil that has come into Kells hands. Characters: Kell: I thought that he was an interesting character. He is a magician and is the only person in this world that can do blood magic. He is a messenger or a traveler for red London so he is basically like the Hermes of this world. He is rough around the edges but he becomes a more likable character as the story goes on. He has a deep love for his brother Rhy, and would do anything for him. His personality kind of changes over the course of the book and he realizes that some power should be dealt with. Rhy: He comes in more towards the end of the story but you do get flashbacks of him throughout the novel. He is the crown prince of red London and he is very flirtatious with every woman that walks. He normally uses Kells powers to get the ladies. Honestly he was actually one of the more entertaining character because he provide comic relief throughout the story. He almost dies in this book and then gets linked to Kell using blood magic or black magic or whatever magic that stone gave. Lila: I personally found her bratty at the beginning of the novel. I really didnt find myself wanting to read her parts, not until she met Kell anyway. She likes teasing Kell which is kind of interesting. My favorite part in this book is when she made the replica of Kell strip in front of her. I guess would make her interested Kell looks wise. She kisses him at the beginning and he kisses her at the end. They have a odd relationship. I dont know if she loves him or if she just wanting to tease him. Holland: He is the other magician besides Kell. He has a way different personality and he was messenger for White London. He was tortured by the monarchy of white London so he kind of a reason to be the way he is. I kind of felt bad through this novel for him because I felt like all of his actions were not really his. He might have said that all of his actions were his but I dont think he had a say in what he was doing because of the seal on his chest. He is the one who ends up going to Black London at the very end of the story instead of Kell. White London Rulers: the twins of the white London were the main antagonist of the story. They were trying to cause trouble for red London because red London did not come to their aid when black London was becoming corrupt. I noticed a lot of people in white London in particular in novel were very selfish and just wanted more and more power. Red London was more reasonable with their leadership and looks like the people really wanted to be there. However white London was more like a dictatorship than a monarchy. The people came into power because they fought for it not because the people wanted them there. The girl ruler kind of creeped me out I forgot her name I think it was Athios. I thought she was creepy and her brother wad creepier. I am glad Kell defeated both of them in the end. There are other characters but they are only minor. Conclusion: I would give this book a 4 out of 5 stars. The only reason why I put it down and not just because the world building was so dense and it made me not want to read the story at times. I know that world building is necessary or else the story confuses me but it should be for like 200 pages it should be maybe a hundred maybe 50 pages and then were done with the world building and get the story. I guess this wont be an issue in the next book because the world is already set in the first book so I dont think that its going to be an issue going further into the series. I hope you guys have a wonderful new year and I will see you when I read the next book. XD
There are good days and hard days for meeven now. Dont let the hard days win. A Court of Mist and Fury exceeded the first book in this trilogy in every way, the plot was intricate, entertaining, beautiful and I found no faults. I recommend this series to everyone! Please note, quick disclaimer: this is not a young adult book. If young adult is what you are looking for, or you are a young reader, I do not recommend this for you. This is a new adult series for mature readers and has mature content Since this is a review, below is spoiler central, if you havent read the book, dont read any further. You have been warned. A Court of Mist and Fury is the second book in the Court of Thorns and Roses TrilogySeries not sure which it keeps changing and it delivered over and above what A Court of Thorns and Roses did. A Court of Mist and Fury picks up in the Spring Court after Feyre has saved the Fae from Amarantha under the mountain. Feyre is dealing with the aftermath of what she did to save Tamlin, and as we begin three months down the track she is not fairing well. Rhysand has not collected on his bargain yet, but we follow Feyre and her life trying to deal with who she is, what she has become and where she belongs in Prythian. This Book is everything and more! Captivating, exciting, unique, funny, beautiful, romantic, heated, emotional and packed with so much action! You name it, ACOMAF has it! Sarah J. Maas has a way with world building, and her writing is full of descriptions that allow us to really see the world she has created and appreciate it for what it is. I appreciate the time she took to describe the beauty of Velaris, and why it was so important to Rhysand to protect. I liked the idea of Velaris as a whole, a beautiful piece of Prythian left untouched from the hands of Amarantha, and a place where Rhys and the inner circle call home. The plot was so fast paced in A Court of Mist and Fury, and it was astonishing how much happened in 624 pages. I felt we learnt endless amounts about so many people and places in such a quick time frame, as well as that, we had a full developed plot that was getting us closer to the endgame of the story... Even though I dont even know what that is currently. I couldnt of asked for a more perfect plot to the second story. There was no second book syndrome up in here! Feyre Darling Feyre was really suffering in A Court of Mist and Fury, she was in such a dark place at the beginning and the development she had in this book has to be recognised as nothing less than amazing. She went in broken, beaten and in pain, and at the end she was a weapon and a survivor and nothing could take that away from her. Shes such a wonderful character, and shes so powerful that I cannot wait for her to unleash on the world. Then we move on to the beautiful Rhysand and thankyou to Queen Maas for giving us such a character that is not only powerful but gentle, sexy and layered! He was someone I went it thinking I would hate, but wow was I wrong. I enjoyed seeing he wasnt one dimensional, Sarah could of easily made a sexy character that we would all swoon over. Instead she made Rhysand, who was just as broken as Feyre, who had endured and protected his people for 50 years while he was a whore to ensure their safety. He sacrificed himself for his people, he did unspeakable things for his people, and I think that shows what a exceptional leader he is. He was nothing less than perfect, I would almost say he was more than perfect if that existed. Tamlin. Tamlin Tamlin... Now I will rant about him in a moment but I wanted to touch on his character first, and the fact that Tamlins love for Feyre literally made him stupid. In ACOMAF he became overbearing, possessive and irrational. He didnt see the relationship for the toxicity that it became, it definitely wasnt like that in ACOTAR. He was exactly what Feyre needed at that time, however in A Court of Mist and Fury she didnt need a protector, she needed someone to help her deal with what happened under the mountain, she needed someone to help her understand and control her powers and he did nothing but sweep them under the rug, and act like problems werent there. The biggest problem I had with Tamlin was that he declared that Feyre was his property and that he would consort with enemy forces that are set to destroy them just to ensure she was back with him. One of my biggest pet peeves is men who think they own a woman, and Sarah really tugged on my hate of that in this one. A great addition to the character development though, I do like how she flipped our feelings completely, from a lovable character to one I now despise. Other than Rhysand, there was another group of people that won my heart in A Court of Mist and Fury, and that was the inner circle... I am 100 fangirling on the inner circle, I love all of them as a unit, and when looked at individually they all hold up perfectly as indepth characters. Not one of the inner circle was carried by the others, they were all perfectly crafted and created a fantastic dynamic together. Honestly, I could read about the inner circle for a whole spin off series. I adore them. Now, this is the moment you are all waiting for. This is the moment my friend Jade from Jadeyraereads is waiting for also, so you can join Jade in this enjoyment of me eating my words. Abandon fucking ship. I was happily sailing my Feylin ship, and then shit got real. Feylin died within me, I really held on but Tamlin destroyed any hope of anyone staying on his side. Here begins my rant, so I apologise for a few brief moments. HOW DARE TAMLIN BREAK MY HEART LIKE THIS! HOW DARE HE THINK FEYRE IS HIS PROPERTY! HOW DARE HE TELL LUCIEN TO TAKE HER AGAINST HER WILL! HOW DARE HE LOCK HER UP! and then he went next level HOW DARE HE SELL OUT HIS OWN COUNTRY, HIS PEOPLE AND PRYTHIAN! HOW DARE HE BREATHE AFTER THE SHIT HE PULLED! Also side shade for Lucien, because right now he is also on the traitor boat, that I hope gets blown up. My friend through many dangers. My lover who had healed my broken and weary soul. My mate who had waited for me against all hope, despite all odds. As one door closes another one opens, enter the absolute god of a High Lord Rhysand! The whole fandom squeals with excitement and yes I am with them also! I appreciated everything about Feysand and their relationship. I like that it wasnt instant and it was a long burning development throughout the whole book, it was wonderful the development and fully appreciate that they were perfection together. He didnt hold a leash on her, and more than that he appreciated that she was a force to be reckoned with on her own. He also didnt shut her out of the workings of his Court, he brought her in and showed her his world. He didnt want to run his Court and have her as a wife, he wanted them to run it together. I love it. I ship it. I apologise for not reading ACOMAF sooner. Overall, this book was everything I didnt know I wanted. I was skeptical because I loved how ACOTAR ended, but Sarah J. Maas pulled me in and filled my soul with everything I said I didnt want, and I ended up LOVING IT! And so Tamlin unwittingly led the High Lady of the Night Court into the heart of his territory. Now, off you go High Lady of the Night Court and destroy them in ACOWAR. I am out for blood. Favourite Moment: EVERY MOMENT. Cannot even answer that. Favourite Quote: I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again I would not, could not be broken. Tamed. Rating: 55
Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales Quick  Dirty: Awesome YA Paranormal book set in London in the 1800s. This was a great fast read with amazing characters and a great story. Opening Sentence: The demon exploded in a shower of inchor and guts. The Review: Tessa Greys life is about to change. Her aunt just recently passed away and her only family left is her brother Nate. He has been in London for a few years now and she decides it is time to join him. So she leaves New York and travels across the ocean to be with her brother. Upon arriving she is kidnapped by two witches who are called the Dark Sisters. London is full of werewolves, vampires, fairies, warlocks and other supernaturals known as downworlders. The Dark Sisters force Tessa to realize she is not totally human. It turns out she is a type of downworlder and a very rare one. She can take form of anyone she wants as long as she has something that belonged to that person. The Dark Sisters work for the mysterious Magister and Tessa is a big part of his evil plan. Fortunately, Tessa is rescued by a young Shadowhunter named Will. Shadowhunters are warriors that protect the world from demons and at times downworlders who are misbehaving. They have angel blood and are known as the Nephilim. Because they have angel blood in their system they are faster, stronger and can become invisible to humans. After Will rescues Tessa he takes her to the London institute which is a safe haven for all shadowhunters. While there she discovers that her brother is missing. She must find him but she will need the help of the shoadowhunters and she is a downworlder, but they dont know what kind. The Magister has a vendetta against the shadowhunters and would do anything to destroy them. He has created a mechanical army with one purpose to destroy the shadowhunters, but somehow Tessa is a big part of his plan. So in exchange for helping the shadowhunters with the Magister they agree to help Tessa find her brother. Tessa meets and befriends many of the shadowhunters at the institute. First there is the mysterious, gorgeous Will. Most of the time he is a total jerk to Tessa and pretty much everyone else as well. Then there are those rare occasions that he will let Tessa in and show her what an amazing person he really is. The only person Will seems to connect with and truly care about is his best friend and fellow shadowhunter Jem. Jem was cursed as a young man and they have yet to find a cure for it. The curse is slowly killing him and the only way they have found to slow it down is for Jem to take opium every day. The only problem with the drug is that it is also killing him just slower than the curse would. As Tessa gets to know the boys she starts to have feelings for both of them. On top of her boy problems she has to find her brother, figure out what she is, and try to stop the Magister. The characters in this book are amazing and I love each and every one of them. Tessa is a great heroine, she is strong and sensible. She is naive at times but she always tries to follow her heart wherever it may lead her. Will is a really interesting boy. He is totally beautiful but always so distant. He pushes everyone away, even those he cares about. There is great chemistry between Tessa and Will but the way he treats her most of the time is unacceptable. Then there is the always constant Jem. He is a total sweetheart with a heart made of gold. He quickly befriends Tessa and does all he can to help her. They stay mostly on the friend level in this book but there is hope for more in the books to come. Personally, I have to admit that I am Team Will in this book even though he can be a jerk, the times when he is open and shows what he can truly be like made me totally fall in love with him. The story in this book is amazing. It is nonstop action, betrayal, romance, and beautifully developed characters. Clares writing is flawless and so beautifully composed. I loved everything about this book from it being set in London in the 1800s which happens to be my favorite setting to the steamy romance, and amazing plot. If you havent read any of Cassandra Clares books you should totally start now. I have enjoyed everything she has written immensely. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys YA, I am pretty sure you will love it. Notable Scene: The change shattered like glass. With a cry Tessa fell to her knees, the torn little bow falling from her hand. It was her hand again  Emma had gone, like a castoff skin. Tessa was once more alone inside her own mind. Mrs. Blacks voice came from far away. Theresa? Where is Emma? Shes dead, Tessa whispered.  She died in an alley  bled to death. Good. Mrs. Dark exhaled a sound of satisfaction. Well done, Theresa. That was very good. Tessa said nothing. The front of her dress was splotched with blood, but there was no pain. She knew it was not her blood; it wasnt the first time this had happened. She closed her eyes, spinning in the darkness, willing herself to faint. FTC Advisory: Margaret K. McElderry BooksSimon  Schuster provided me with a copy of Clockwork Angel. No goody bags, sponsorships, material connections, or bribes were exchanged for my review.
The Round House is a knockout of a book. Louise Erdrich is one of the true deities in Americas literary Olympus. With The Round House she has used her mythic creative powers to give us a book that can be read as a pageturner about a terrible crime, the attempt to identify the criminal and take action, or as a rich, layered look at a culture in a place and time, and a lad coming of age within it, the tale imbued with telling details, a colorful palette of imagery and cultural significance. Or best of all, both. The story opens with a father and son trying to remove invasive tree roots from the foundation of their home. This being Erdrich, you can figure that roots of one sort and another will figure in the story. Antone Bazil Coutts, known as Joe, is thirteen years old. His father, also Antone Bazil, is a judge with great reverence for the law. When Joes mother, Geraldine Coutts, is brutally beaten and raped she retreats into the security of solitude, not only to allow herself time to heal, but to try to protect her family, and others as well. The thrust of the story is the puzzle of who and why. Erdrich drops clues along the way like a seasoned writer of detective fiction. How we understand the world is informed by the stories we are told, the culture in which we are raised. Christians are raised on stories of magical abundance from a few loaves and fishes, reincarnation, angels, a sometimes communicative if often cranky, creator. A colorful local priest offers Christian teaching. Many of the Ojibwe we meet here have friends or relations who are believers. The Ojibwe have their legends too. Erdrich shows this by imbuing her tale with magical realism. Native lore is both told in stories and shown as living reality. This is a world in which the shadow of a passing crane becomes an angel on a bedroom wall, a world in which a twin feels the presence of a doppelganger, of her separated other, and in which the evil spirit, a wendiigoo, in a dark man seeks to devour the spirits of others. Ghosts figure in the story. Joe sees one. His father reports having seen ghosts as well. Mooshum, Joes beloved grandfather, explains something about ghosts to Joe. Other characters as well report seeing ghosts or having their own otherworldly experiences. We see the Ojibwe affiliating with and being protected by various animals. Joe seeks guidance by visiting his clan totem, herons. Another tale is told of an Ojibwe being saved by a turtle. And an old bison communicates with one young brave in a legend. In addition family names include Larks and Coutts, and a town physician is Doctor Egge. I wont ask which came first. We see the events in Hoopdance, North Dakota, through Joes eyes. Joe has a group of pals, most importantly his studly bff, Cappy. They see things through a more contemporary lens, Star Trek: The New Generation TNG, the series having begun less than a year prior. The boys use of TNG stories, lore in this context, offers them meaningful language with which to define elements of their world. Of particular interest is the episode called Skin of Evil . Dont check it out until you are reading the book. The relevance will be immediately obvious. The boys banter and relationships give the feel of a Stephen King story, one of those in which he particularly shines at portraying young people. Together with Native beliefs and Christian teaching, we have an unusual trinity of primary interpretive influences. What is the Round House? We learn its history and generation from Mooshum. It is a meeting place and is supposed to be a safe haven, a building the Ojibwe, one in particular, were told to construct by a spirit. Religious ceremonies, among other events, take place there. And yet it has been violated, just as tree roots attempted to insert themselves in the foundation of Joes house. We learn the story of the buildings genesis, see it in benign contemporary use, and see it again, under less than benign circumstances. It is also situated in a location near where sundry jurisdictions intersect, Ojibwe, state, federal, the perplexity of which figures in the tale. There is a cornucopia of riches in Erdrichs construction. Joes fathers respect for the law is almost religious, and is mirrored by the knowledge of and contempt for the law expressed by the baddie. Native lore is compared to that of classic Greece. There are plentiful references made here that inform the story. Classics like the Iliad, Shakespeare, Plato and more recently, Dune, which resonates, with a young man taking on adult responsibilities. Bazil refers to his Handbook of Federal Indian Law as his bible. This compares with the priest and his actual Bible and Mooshum, Joes grandfather, with his oral history and tribal spiritual beliefs. Is Bazils belief in the law any more magical than Father Traviss belief in an eternal creator? Is Father Traviss belief in a resurrected savior any more out there than believing that one can communicate with an elderly bison? Clothing is used to great effect as well. When one key character is in the hospital, two relations don his clothing as a way of feeling close to him. A woman with a dicey past is shown to full effect by the costume she dons. After an infection of the spirit, a woman says that some Ojibwe women dressed me in a new ribbon dress they made. I started healing and felt even better. And the counterpart, nakedness, is also revelatory. Hiding away permeates, from Geraldine hiding in her home and inside herself, to Nanabush, a character in a story, hiding inside the carcass of a dead bison, to the genesis of the Round House as a physical manifestation of the bisons carcass, a safe place, a hideaway. Erdrichs work is imbued, not only with Native American characters, but with a look at Native reality on the ground, the buildings, the legal challenges, the extended family relations, in addition her use of magical realism. We are told of Native encounters with bison, turtles and cranes. We are also shown how Native people have been treated by the American legal system. That Joes father has such longterm faith in the merits of the law is impressive, maybe inspirational and possibly sad. Her compelling story carries us along at a nice pace. We get to enjoy interesting travel companions on this journey, people we want to spend time with, particularly Joe, and while we are getting from here to there, maybe on a shuttle craft? we are treated to a fascinating look at things we might not have seen before, ideas we might not have encountered, history we might not have known. If you have read Erdrich before you know how good she is. If you have not read her before you are in for a treat. So if you get the urge to dash out and pick up a copy of The Round House all I can advise is make it so. You will definitely engage. PS  In case, for some reason, you do not want to jump to the provided link, here is a very spoilerish bit on the TNG episode noted above. Skin of Evil is a Star Trek: New Generation story the boys refer to. In it a powerful, bloblike creature, torments several of the Enterprise crew, even killing one. An element of this being is that it feels terribly lonely, abandoned by its own kind. Here, Linden, our psycho killer, is the one who truly feels empty, which is ironic since he was the twin who was kept. His damaged sibling, Linda, has felt his presence all her life, and experiences emptiness, but never turned to such darkness. In the TNG episode, Armus, the baddy, was acting out of a feeling of abandonment. Linden  wiindigoo  Armus The twist here is that the child who was literally abandoned turned out to be a good person, while the one who was kept became a monster.

Originally Posted On The Sassy Book Geek Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right. Let me just start off by saying Im usually not a big contemporary reader so when I rate a contemporary 5 stars its just through the roof amazing! The Hate U Give is probably one of the most hyped books out there and it is 100 worthy of all of it, not only is it just an overall incredible read but its also a very important book. It focuses on the Black Lives Matter movement and speaking up for equality and against racism and police brutality. I wish I could go into more depth on the subject matter of this book but I am not one to talk about important issues such as these that I dont know anything about personally not saying Im completely ignorant I just dont know enough to go giving you all the information you need. All I can do is try and give The Hate U Give a review that will do it at least some justice and convince you all just how much you need to get your hands on a copy. The Plot First things first, I cannot believe this is Angie Thomass debut novel! Her writing is phenomenal and she writes like a pro, it was easy to follow, entertaining, and very emotional. Trust me when I say that books have to be VERY well written for me to get so immersed in the characters and story that Ill be crying and I did more than once throughout this book! As I mentioned above this book focuses mainly on racial inequality, our corrupt justice system, police brutality, and racism and in my opinion it really nails all of these things and sheds light on the truth of the way our society works. While this is some pretty heavy stuff that doesnt mean The Hate U Give is that way the whole time, in fact there is a lot of humor in the otherwise somber plot. I loved how many lighthearted moments were included even though what Starr was going through is very tragic and scary. The story is very character driven and that being said almost every single character has their own storyline that interconnects with everyone elses as well. So the plot is very complex and there is never, NEVER a dull moment. You will be hooked from page one and will be 100 invested in these characters stories. Remember when I said the writing is very emotional? Thats probably one of the things that stuck out the most with me, just how emotional this story gets in so many different ways. There were times when my heart was absolutely broken, other times when I was overjoyed, and times where I was legitimately terrified for the characters. This last thing I want to say involving the plot is kind of a side note but I wanted to mention it because it pissed me off so much! The white kids at Starrs private school decide to hold a protest for Justice for Khalil which is awesome....except the only reason they did anything was to get out of class and they didnt actually care. How about NOOOOOO? I did really appreciate the fact though that some of the other white characters refused to do it once they found out it was just a gimmick. The Characters If I was going to be honest and tell you what my absolute favorite part of this book was Id have to say all of the characters! There wasnt a single character who didnt have a personality and a story all their own. Starr is an extremely downtoEarth and relatable character, I was rooting for her the entire time! Not to mention shes also sassy, smart, and brave but she also isnt without her flaws as well. Overall shes very complex and has earned a spot in my favorite bookish heroines! I also absolutely adored the family dynamic in The Hate U Give, literally loved it to little bits and pieces! Its definitely a nice change to see a loving, supportive family in YA with childrenteens who respect their parents and elders. I mean how many times do we see YA heroesheroines that blow their parents off? Too many is the answer and it drives me nuts to see kids be so disrespectful. The secondary characters were amazing as well and it was almost mindblowing to see so many complex and developed characters all at once! The Romance So this is going to be very brief because while there is romance in the story it definitely does not take over the plot, THANK GOD! While I do love the way Starrs interracial relationship is handled by themselves and outside parties I just didnt like it overall, I felt that Starr and Chris just didnt really have any chemistry. I think that Starrs friendships and family relationships were handled a lot better with much more depth. In Conclusion This is usually where I state the things I did like and didnt like in the book and honestly there just isnt anything I disliked that strongly, it is a 5 star book after all! I loved the story, the writing, and most of all the characters and I have zero complaints. Recommend? If I could give every single one of you a copy I would thats how much I wish everyone would read The Hate U Give because as I said not only is it just a plain amazing book its also an extremely important one that handles some very serious and all too real issues. GO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!
Sydney Sage was desperate to get back into the Alchemists good graces. Still in fear of being sent for reeducation and that her sister, Zoe, would be recruited to take her place as the familys next Alchemist, she was willing to accept any assignment they had for her. Even if it meant being sent to Palm Springs to become babysitter and roommate to one of the royal Moroi, Jill Dragomir. Even if it meant pretending to be related to vampires, the unnatural creatures with magical abilities that she feared. And even if it meant being forced to work alongside Keith Darnell, an Alchemist she despised possibly even more than the vampires, themselves. But getting the chance to attend private school didnt sound all bad. Especially to someone who had been home schooled their entire life and who would probably never have the chance to go to college. How was she to know just how complicated things really were and that humans could get themselves into nearly as much trouble as the vampires? And how could she have possibly foreseen an enemy she didnt even know existed? With no one she could turn to for help among the Alchemists and feeling there was no one she could really trust, Sydney would have to find answers on her own. Because her only other option would be to get help from a vampire. And that worked out so well for her the last time....  Fastpaced, exciting and absolutely spellbinding, Bloodlines meets every expectation and then some for this spinoff series by author Richelle Mead about vampires, alchemists and humans and the dangers that exist in a world that includes them all. With a mix of old characters and new, a brand new setting and a whole new mystery to solve, this introductory book into the series is a definite must read. The writing is engaging, the plot is intriguing, the characters are witty, interesting, likable, detestable and mysterious and the ending will leave readers craving book two. In Bloodlines, Sydney Sage, the Alchemist who put a lot on the line to help Rose Hathaway is back. And this time shes the main character and the story is told through her eyes as she uproots her life and heads to Palm Springs to Amberwood Prep where she is tasked with watching over Jill Dragomir, the Moroi Princess whose life is at risk now that Lissa has been made Queen. As tricky of an assignment as it is, its made more difficult by the fact that Sydney has never attended school and learned to socialize, there are secrets the vampires are keeping from her and the Alchemist who is supposed to oversee things is one of her biggest enemies and doesnt want her there. Once again, Richelle Mead captivates readers with her lovable and relatable characters, with writing that is inviting and enticing and with the promise of something even more thrilling in books to come. Fans of the authors Vampire Academy series will not be disappointed. And new readers will be easily ensnared by the evercharming, witty and selfdeprecating Adrian Ivashkov, the adorably sweet Jill Dragomir, the fiercely protective Eddie Castile and the kind, clever and sympathetic Sydney Sage. Full of surprises, danger, suspense and betrayal, Bloodlines is utterly riveting and the start to a series not to be missed. On a personal note: Bloodlines totally rocked. I was so worried Id spend the entire read missing Rose and Dimitri. And while I did miss them just a little bit, I loved getting to see things from Sydney Sages perspective. And I loved getting to see Adrian through someone elses eyes, see how he acted when Rose wasnt around and see how he interacted with girls other than Rose. I loved Sydneys character in the Vampire Academy series so I wasnt worried about getting to know her in this spinoff series. And I instantly liked her again, though she did frustrate me at times. As clever as she was when it came to things like schoolwork, she could be really dense about nearly everything else. Which was somewhat of a surprise at first. Especially as she was supposed to be pretty good at figuring things out and yet no warning bells went off in her head about certain characters behaviors. But even with the shortterm cluelessness, which I dont think will happen again, she was an awesome character to get to know better. Between her restrictive upbringing, the fears and prejudices that were instilled in her from a very early age and the rigid and unbending principles and rules that the Alchemists lived by, Sydney could have been just as unlikable a character as her father, or Keith. But she wasnt. She still managed to think for herself, she was still able to see the good in people and she still managed to be kind of bada when she wanted to be. But while I loved getting to know Sydney and having the story told from her point of view, Adrian Ivashkov was my favorite. I found myself looking forward to every scene he was in. Just as I did when I first met him in the Vampire Academy series. He was one of my favorite characters in that series, so that automatically made him my favorite in this one. Adrian was every bit as charming and lovable as always. And even though he was heartbroken, he didnt stop being a total flirt. He was fun. He was adorable. He was maddening. He was delectable. But it was also nice seeing his protective side come out for someone other than Rose. And just like in the Vampire Academy books, when he let things get intense, let his nonchalance slip away, he was absolutely hypnotizing and kind of breathtaking. I sort of forgot that about him. That one line of his at the end.... Well, nope, I cant say what that is, but I could swear it made my heart skip a beat. Oh and I loved the cameo appearances. While I wont be all spoilery and say who showed up in this book, I will say that it was awesome that they did. Though it was definitely different seeing them from another characters perspective. And I am so looking forward to just who will be showing up in the next book. Yes, that surprise was dropped at the very end. Speaking of The Golden Lily, I am so freaking happy I waited to read this book. Because there is no way I would have been able to suffer the long, long, long wait from when Bloodlines was released until the sequels release. As it is Im dying. Absolutely dying. I was totally caught up in Richelle Meads world once again. And I didnt want to move on to another one. I was totally invested in her characters and I was not at all prepared to let them go. And while I was able to solve the mystery long before Sydney did, I loved seeing her figure it out for herself. And I loved the way things ended. Especially after that one scene where.... Oops. If I had to describe this book in just three short sentences they would be: Awesomely awesome. Super fun. Totally delicious. So, yes, I want to reread this book right now. Yes, I want to go back and reread the entire Vampire Academy series. Yes, this book was absolutely fanfreakingtastic. And yes, I am keeping fingers crossed that this time around Adrian gets his happily ever after.
Reread Jan 8  13 2017 Loved rereading it the second time :. Same comments as my original review. Originally Read Jan79 2016 4.5 stars Its not fair. WHY? I ask this because this time round, the story gets so intense towards the end! I LOVED IT. Hmmm Im not so sure about Queen Levana. The glimpse we had of her, wasnt very deep. I hope she becomes deeper in the next books, rather than a cardboard cut out of a villain! More Later! This book..... U P D A T E P L O T The plot of this book is loosely based on Little Red Riding Hood. More like inspired by! Half of this book follows the story of Scarlet, our Main Protagonist for this novel, while the other half focuses on whats happening with Cinder, Kai, and Thorne. Its a very simple plot that builds, and builds, and then climaxes shockingly, before riding the intense rollercoaster all the way to the end of the book. Unfortunately I cant say much more about the plot without giving away the whole thing!! I will say that Cinder becomes a fugitive in this book, on top of all the other labels that have been attributed to her. C H A R A C T E R S Scarlet  I actually really liked Scarlet. Shes pretty out there like Cinder, action first then think later, but unlike Cinder whos more prone to blaming herself, Scarlet is a little firecracker. Shes definitely true to the stereotypical red head, all hot and fiery, and not afraid at all. Yet, she is also very grounded in the fact that there are some events beyond her abilities and she should be scared. And so there are a few screamy moments, but never once, not once does Scarlet really let it get to her. She bites back even when shes scared, but she never does anything stupid. When she knows shes helpless against her enemy, she holds back and waitsish. Omg Wolf. You know I knew he was shifty from the start. Isnt the Wolf always shifty? But man, when the twist came out, it definitely was not what I expected. If I expected one thing about his character, that wasnt it. And I was shocked! Wolf has replaced Kai on my list of awesome male characters in the Lunar Chronicles. But really, I think after reading Cress, my list is going to change again. I suppose it cant be helped, not with the way Meyer works her romances, her plot, and her characters! Cinder is back! And boy I love her a lot more in Scarlet than I did in Cinder. Shes just so much more calmer and relatable. And you know, the character development for her worked for the better. Love her. Now, she just has to do everything she has to do and maybe save the world by the end of it. Kai is also back! And we get to see more from his perspective, but I think I liked seeing him better from only Cinders pov, since hes a tad bit helpless in his currently situation. Though, I guess he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. And he knows what he has to do, but he hovers and keeps hoping to find Selene, but sometimes I think he could be doing more. Then again, he is young and has just become Emperor, and just a little bit unprepared. Still, hes been trained for this all his life so it shouldnt have been too difficult to make a steady choice rather than letting it crumble so badly under his fingers? And yet at the same time, its not so bad! Kais characterparts I mean. Meyer does write him believably enough. Supporting. Thorne! We meet Thorne in Scarlet and he plays a small role as a companion to Cinder when she escapes from prison. IKO, Im so glad shes back, love her. And all other supporting play interesting small roles, no one else, I think, is worth mentioning much without giving away some spoilers. S E T T I N G Set in New Beijing, a futuristic city thats the centre of the Eastern Commonwealth, developed after World War 4 or something like that. You get the point. Its a scifi futuristic story. There are cyborgs people living on the Moon which is referred to as Luna, and the inhabitants, Lunars who possessed bioelectric manipulation abilities. In addition to my comments about the world in my Cinder review, I do feel that the labelling of the political divisions bugs me a lot. I still cant get the term Eastern Commonwealth through my head. I mean logically its correct, but it just doesnt sound right. I mean, really, Commonwealth is obviously commonly associated with the British Empire. And Britain and things like Chinaother Asian countries dont really mesh well in my head. Then again, has Meyer mentioned who is part of the Eastern Commonwealth? Id love to know. Anyway, enough of me picking at the world a bit moreIm sorry, I cant help it, it reminds me so much of the world of the Selection which I didnt really like at all, and at least the world of the Lunar Chronicles is a little bit better. W R I T I N G Even better than Cinder! But still that familiar style, mixing the emotive with the action. She has written in 3rd person, and the story alternates among a number of perspectives. I like her style, simply because she makes the whole story very exciting! O V E R A L L This book ended up with such a big bang, even bigger than the first book, and I was blown away. So blown away I didnt hesitate to pick up Cress, which Im reading right now and wondering if the sun in Aus is causing me to melt, or if its the book? By the way, if you didnt really like Throne of Glass as a High Fantasy YA series, then dont give up yet! Try the Lunar Chronicles. This, actually, might be one of a few which I would actually recommend and suggest as a science fiction, high fantasy YA read. It just has all the elementsonly at a YA level of an adult equivalent. Action, a bit of romance, intense epic plot about an evil queen and the girl who will defeat her.
In light of the final book of this series coming out, I wanted to share my reviews from the first two installments of the books. What do you guys think of this series?  Overall I give this book a 45 stars!! What it is about: A young aspiring art student has to physicist parents. Shes grown up with a constant string of college students always in her house working with her parents. Marguerite, is just trying to figure out what she wants to do after high school, when tragedy strikes. Her dad is suddenly in an accident. Although she does not believe it was an accident, but an attack. Marguerites parents were developing a device called a firebird which allows you travel between different dimensions. Marguerite embarks on a adventure filled journey through dimensions to try to catch whoever hurt her dad. I went into this book not really knowing what it was about, I had just heard so many great things and the cover was too beautiful so I purged and bought it! It was not what I had expected at all, in a good way!! I really enjoyed this book, there were certain aspects that really pulled me in! The reason I gave it 45 stars was because where I did really enjoy the dimension travel and science aspect to this novel, I wasnt so set on the romance and when the book ended I was kind of disappointed. Then again, that has to do with my personal preference of who I ship! I do have to say that I am really excited for the next book! If you like adventure, history and the unknown then this book is great for you! Its an easy and quick read, Claudias writing flows magnificently! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE REST OF THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Okay firsts things first, how did you guys feel about Marguerite? I think she had her moments and for the most part I liked her but sometimes I found her frustrating and kind of odd. By far my favorite part of this book was when they were in the Russian dimension. I am a huge fan of history and loved it! I also wasnt head over heals with her relationship with Paul at the beginning but he grew on me and it made me really happy when they spent the night together in the cabin! Then he died and I was quite sad. But I really loved what Claudia did there. Unlike predictable plots, it went sort of deeper to kill off this main character after we i mean me finally really liked him. Not to mention how guilty Marguerite felt from taking away the night the other Marguerite deserved. Thinking about that aspect of the dimension traveling and the implications and affects it had on other peoples lives really made me happy. I liked that Claudia made Marguerite feel guilty, after all, if you were the other Marguerite and you woke up to find the love of your life dead, you didnt get the chance to tell him how you felt or spend time with him in the way you wanted. How horrible!! Yet our Marguerite slept with him and gave him something happy, but the Russian Marguerite will never know that! Okay for Paul vs. Theo Lets talk about Theo for a bit, when they first mentioned that he was a drug user it really enticed me into the story more. Most YA novels dont mention drugs or getting drunk like this book does. I really appreciate that. I also never suspected anything about the weird green substance until near the end of the book when Theo started acting weird. Thats another great thing about this book! For the most part, I do not expect the plot twists! Its not predictable which is awesome! I really liked Theo and shipped him with Marguerite until that fateful night with Paul. BUT after we all thought Paul died, I thought that also left the door open for Theo and Marguerite to blossom!! I know Im a horrible person but when we found out Paul was still alive I was a little disappointed! Because I wanted Theo and Marguerite to be together! I really only liked Paul in Russia and didnt enjoy how they ended up together. I still have hope for Theo and Marguerite though, I know its doomed, but ahh I ship it, the poor boy doesnt have a chance. What can I say, I like the underdog. Last thing I wanted to talk about was how her dad was still alive!! Once again, another expert plot twist! When he was singing that song gaaaaah! I love all the small connections in the mystery, it makes for a great story! QUESTIONSTHINGS I WANT TO SEE IN THE SEQUEL! I want to see more of her sister in the next book, and her mom, I want them in on the action! I loved the Russian dimension! I hope there is a historically interesting dimension in the next one! Why can only one person in a dimension be able to jump without reminders? How many reminders does it take until they dont work anymore?? How much of the green stuff can you invest without any longlasting affects?? WHO WILL MARGUERITTE END UP WITH?? WILL THEO FIND OUT ABOUT THE NIGHT IN THE CABIN?? That is all!! Tell me what you thought of this book!
4 STARS out of 5 spoilers are hidden and close to end of review Review DAMN THAT ENDING TO ALLLLLL HELL. WHY? WHY? WHYYYYYYY? Some things in life are so sad that there are no words to describe the amount of sadness, grief, and sorrow a person is feeling. I assume this is why God allowed humans the simple act of crying. When a person cries, they feel the sadness slowly ease out of them. They feel as though they are justifiably respecting a person that has died through showing their grief. They allow a moment of sorrow to overcome them and cry out a small portion of their unseen pain. Alexa First of all this book DESTROYED ME and words...words FAILED ME by the end. I dont think I have ever been so flustered when writing a review as I am with this one there was things I liked and some things I did not like.Ill expand on that later One things for sure, I was warned by the author as are you. Author Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong. Definitely safe to say I got what I asked for. Monsters dont always lurk in the shadows. Reaching up, he runs a fingertip slowly down the length of my jaw. Leaning forward, his breath warms me as he mutters a hairsbreadth away from my lips, Sometimes they hide in plain sight. Alexa Ballentine is an American working in Australia as a casesocial worker. She considers her kids her cubs, she deeply cares for their well being and it shows in her actions. In fact I dont think there is one bad bone in Alexas body. Coming from two parents who were not parents at all she personally knows from experience how bad it can be out on the streets. Alexa is also aware of him; watching her. Hes been doing it for some time now and she can feel his eyes on her whenever he is near. He is the eyes under the hoodie. I need her. I want her. I will own her. Twitch This is where things get complicated. Something bad happens and it brings hoodie stalker guy up close and personal with Alexa. Thats when he does something Ive been wishing for forever. He lowers the hood. And dude is FRIGHTENING. Scares her, scares me, it gets real. You have no idea what will happen. Opening my eyes to find his still on my face, I ask a hushed, Whats your name? The corner of his lip tips up. Doesnt matter. Youll forget it once Im gone. Taking a small step towards him, I promise, No, I wont. Its his turn to take a step back. He watches me some more. Those eyes. It feels as if they see everything. Breathing in, he replies on an exhale, Im Twitch. We meet the guy in the hood. His name is Twitch and he has an itch so to speak for Alexa. She wants him. Theres something animalistic about this man. Something I want to be a part of. Something I want to be included in. Hes a force of nature. Alexa The attraction is very clear and she lets him know. Twitch is very up front with Alexa when he tells her what he is about and uhhh how he likes it. DIRTY. As readers take in both povs we learn that Twitch has an agenda. He wants to break Alexa, but why? Theres something about having your choices taken from you that is equally liberating and frightening. Handing over control to a person is a big deal. A showing of trust. And sometimes, I would like to be taken on a ride rather than drive. Alexa My Sweet and Sour My Sweet  I enjoyed how Belle Aurora gave us snippets of personality with the internal monologues. I found it witty and entertaining. My Sour  Well my first choice is too spoilerish so here is my second choice, mean Twitch... I did not like mean Twitch at all. This is the first time secondary characters made the book for me and the main characters just seemed to give me a splitting headache. I was so unsure on how to rate RAW. Why? Well for one, I struggled with the hero, Twitch and his motives towards Alexa. More so the reasoning behind it. Second, Alexa and her internal battle with allowing Twitch to Dominate her.. It seemed like she fought it throughout the entire book and I just did not get that about her. Either your down or not. Her actions spoke volumes though..She was DEFINITELY down. So why internally fight it, just accept it. Maybe that is easier said then done, dont know. My Thoughts Basically I was unhappy with the reasoning Twitch used for going after Alexa. Yes, I understand his anger but I feel as if he chose Alexa without just cause. His anger was completely misdirected. So maybe it was just me. I dont know, it just felt wrong... Some may argue that that is the point, it was misdirected, thats the tragedy of it all. And I guess shrugs a shoulder I can see how people feel that way. I sort of thought there was a few plot holes.  How was Twitch able to just set up shop like that in a whole new country with a cover company and so on and so forth? Drug empires are not built over night.  Why did Twitch wait so long to enter Alexas life. He said it took a year to find her, ok so how soon was he in Australia after that?  If he was watching her for so long how did he fail pick up on the fact that she is such a sweet, good hearted person. Was he blinded by his rage? Possible. Why not explore that a bit more? Or is all this a result of his brain injury? Why did she not further question Ling living with him? That irked me the way she dropped it. His stealth missions in and out of her house? How? Guess that falls in to his mysterious ways category huh? My Rating and Why 4 STARS I wanted more. I felt these things could have been explored upon maybe cut out a few sex scenes. OH MY, I cant believe I just said that... I NEVER opt to cut out sex. However, it would have upped my rating if I had these answers of this I am sure. My Ratings Characters Likeable Writing Style Good PlotStoryline Guy wants to break girl, girl wants to be controlled. Can these two find love? Real love? Steam Factor HighVery Steamy on a scale of 110 I say 9 Overall I liked it! My Recommendation: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! Now go forth and read. Then come tell us about it on Goodreads!

This book, man. This book. I never expected this series to mean this much to me. I mean, I only picked up The Raven Boys because of Tumblr! My expectations were not very high. But those low expectations turned into one of the most enjoyable series Ive ever had the pleasure to read. As I hadnt gotten back into reviewing when I read the first three books, this review will probably end up being an ode to the entire series. There will be spoilers galore. Please read past this at your own risk. All credit to the lovely Maggie Stiefvater for the quotes Richard Gansey III had forgotten how many times he had been told he was destined for greatness. Following are, in no particular order, a few of my favorite things about this series: THE UNIQUENESS. This was undoubtedly one of the most unique books and series I have ever read. Everything  from the atmosphere to the characters to the plot. There were so many elements in this series that, separate, might have seemed derivative, but together created a riveting story. Blues psychic family, the hunt for a Welsh king, money vs. poverty, the smalltown America setting, the coming of age of Blue, Gansey, Adam and Ronan. The head is too wise. The heart is all fire. THE PLOT. A girl cannot kiss her true love or hell die  according to her psychic family. A boy was dead, but was brought back to life because another was dying when they shouldnt. The ghost of the boy who was dying when he shouldnt becomes friends with the boy he inadvertently saved. Due to this, the saved boy has spent the last seven years looking for a Welsh king. Another boy becomes a magician, being the eyes as ears for a forest. Another boy can pluck things out of dreams. The five of them visit this other realm  a forest called Cabeswater, where time is not linear and strange things happen. This realm is caused because of a ley line. The living boys attend Aglionby Academy, in the sleepy town of Henrietta, Virginia, and are the eponymous Raven Boys. Weird stuff, yet the series pulls all of this off effortlessly. He was a book, and he was holding his final pages, and he wanted to get to the end to find out how it went, and he didnt want it to be over. THE OTPs. Tumblr wasnt wrong when it suggested these books would have me shipping like crazy. I shipped LIKE CRAZY. The relationships in this book were so well developed and well executed, both platonic and romantic. In the Raven King, though, the romantic relationships had their time to shine. Blue and Gansey: I was looking at my reading activity from the previous books and saw that at some point during the first one I shipped Blue and Adam. I was quite disappointed in past me, honestly. Blue and Gansey were so obviously in love from book 2 on that it hurt to see them sneaking around behind the others backs. It hurt to see them knowing that a kiss meant death, yet loving each other anyway. I loved how we saw them falling in love, how the author didnt rely on physical aspects of their relationship like so many other young adult books but instead showed the compatibility of their souls. When their kiss finally happened, it warmed my heart. Then I read a few lines down, and my heart was quickly unwarmed... I would have been mad if Gansey lived, because it would have gone against everything set up in the previous books. And yet I was heartbroken when Gansey died, kingly though he was. At first, I thought the whole Cabeswaterbeingsacrificedforhislife thing was kind of tacky it kind of was but the more I thought about it, the more I was satisfied. Blue and Gansey get their happily ever after, in a way that was neither a copout nor a complete tragedy. Although I do wonder: was the kiss a onetime thing? Can Blue kiss Gansey, her true love, now without him, you know, dying? Adam and Ronan: gahhhhhhh. Adam smiled cheerily. Ronan would start wars and burn cities for that true smile, elastic and amiable. As much as I loved Blue and Gansey, this was the ship that stole my heart. This was the ship I cried over and truly felt for. This was the best part of the Raven Cycle, in my own humble opinion. Much like Gansey and Blue, the reader had the privilege of seeing Ronan and Adam falling in love. We got to see both of them juggle with these feelings they werent supposed to have. We got to see Ronan risk his future to save Adam from his father. We got to see Adam come to terms with himself. Again, the author didnt use sensuality as a crutch. Ronan and Adam both had to prove their love to each other using looks and words and actions. When their kiss finally came, I cried of happiness. Their kiss was not treated as a kiss between two men but as a kiss between two lovers  and that was very, very important. PYNCH FOREVER, AMIRIGHT? Im not asking him to stay, Ronan thought. Only to come back. I hate to be that girl, but as I was reading I couldnt help but compare Ronan and Adam to Alec and Magnus, and their almostidolized relationship. The former had buildup; the latter did not. The former was treated like a main relationship in the series, not as a gay relationship; the latter seemed to be in the books BECAUSE they were in a gay relationship and diversity. The former were individuals first, partners second. This cannot be said of the latter. Again, I hate to compare, but thinking of everything Adam and Ronan were that Alec and Magnus were not helped me to appreciate the rarity as far as Young Adult fantasy goes that is Adam and Ronan. He was a king. This was the year he was going to die. All in all, 4.5 stars. My only complaint is the ending felt a little rushed what happened with the Gray Man? What about Orla and Jimi? What about Blues newfound and awesome tree powers? but everything was wrapped up satisfactorily, so I cannot count too much off for that. Blue and her Raven Boys stole my heart. I cried, I laughed, I felt  but most of all, I loved. The Raven Cycle, its been an honor.
I want to start off by saying that while I am a fan of Clare and her work I try not to encourage the extreme hype and controversy that surrounds her. However, Lady Midnight deserves all of the praise it gets. Expertly crafted, beautifully written, and surprisingly dark, Clare weaves a magical mystery with family drama and romantic drama seamlessly. Her writing has improved so much its astounding. I have stayed up all night finishing this. More thoughts when Im not half dead! Okay, Ive slept a few more hours and I am ready to begin. Warning, there wont be heavy spoilers but I will be revealing little details about characters so if you dont want to know anything about the book, dont read. It is NOT necessary to read TMI, TID, The Bane Chronicles, and Tales of the Shadowhunter Academy in order to read Lady Midnight but you WILL be spoiled for certain events that happened in these books except for TBC and TotSA. I highly recommend reading them because they are awesome I personally love TID and TotSA the most and because youll understand certain inside jokes in the book. As you can tell from the synopsis, this takes place five years after the events of TMI. Its 2012 and we follow Emma Carstairs and the Blackthorns  Cristina as they try to solve the murders in Los Angeles of both mundanes and fae, and who Emma believes to be behind the murders of her parents. A fae convoy comes and says that in exchange for the LA institutes help they will let Mark choose to either stay with his family or return to the Wild Hunt. Lady Midnight is part detective story, part family drama, with plenty of romance and magic. We meet new characters who I LOVE. Honestly, I love the Blackthorns, Emma, and Cristina. I love their dynamic and how close their family is. They are ruthless. Namely, Julian. Hes had to take care of four kids since he was 12. Yeah, Uncle Arthur is there but theres something about him that is pretty much useless when it comes to the kids. In the wake of their fathers death, Helens exile, and Marks capture by the Hunt, Julian is essentially their father. Emma has been by his side the whole time and shes watched him learn how to take care of young Tavvy, cook, clean, buy groceries, etc. all while easing their nightmares. Hes had to grow up very quickly and there is nothing he wouldnt do to keep his family together, nothing. He wanted to be parabatai with Emma because he was so afraid the Clave would send her away to the Academy, and he needed Emma to stay. Emma is his rock, and its understandable. They are childhood friends who would do anything for each other. And they are certainly NOT a new JaceWill or ClaryTessa. Their personalities are wholly unique and it was great being in the minds of kids who knew who their parents were, have grown up in the Shadowhunter world all their lives, and live in the aftermath of a war. The plot is amazing. You have the overarching plot of solving the murders and finding out whos behind them for Emmas parents and hopefully getting Mark back. Then you have the subplots of Emma and Julians feelings for each other, Kieran  Mark  Cristina  Diego and that whole fiasco, and whether or not Mark will actually choose to stay. Lemme tell you, I was actually suspicious of Diana for quite awhile. She disappears on her own for long periods of time, shes obviously done something illegal, and she holds a lot of secrets. It took me awhile to figure out whos behind everything, and I was pretty sad. It is honestly a pretty heartbreaking story. I think what I love most about the book is how diverse it is. Cristina is Mexican, Diana is black, Mark is bisexual like Helen, and Ty is confirmed by Cassandra to have autism. I wish he could get the professional help he needs. Arthur is obviously mentally ill. Hearing about other shadowhunters who have dyslexia, depression, ADHD etc. and getting hidden away is just so sad. For everything the Clave can do they are not progressive people. They should know that mundanes have medical help for them and should see them as just any other illness that should be treated. I really hope this will be explored more as the trilogy continues, especially with Ty. I do love all of the support he gets from his family, especially from Julian. Marks sexuality isnt really a big thing to him, its just a part of who he is and Im so glad because thats how it should be. Honestly, I love how Clare was so influenced by Annabel Lee took Poes poem and turned it into a shadowhunter thing. The English Lit nerd part of me who loves Poe realized the chapter titles were lines from Annabel Lee and I got so happy. Clare weaves the poem into the plot so well, its amazing. I also loved how Clare hinted that Poe somehow found out about Malcolm and Annabels story and thats who the poem is based off of. SHIPPING MARK AND CRISTINA SO HARD. I just love how Cristina grounds Mark, especially in the beginning when he was readjusting to the human world and being around his family. I dunno, I just have such a soft spot for Mark. Hes been through so much, and I just want him to be happy. Diego is a dummy and can go away because honestly if he really loved Cristina he would have defended her to Jaime. Also, his brother Jaime sounds like a sociopath if he really has no compassion and empathy in his heart. Im really hoping everyone works their love lives out. Emma and Julian need to be saved somehow and Mark and Cristina need to be together. The whole parabatai problem is obviously very worrisome, and Im hoping there will be SOMETHING to make this all work out in two books. As for Kit, I knew there was something about him that had to be important since he has a POV. Once he started doing cool moves I was like okay this kid is the lost Herondale. And then Jem and Tessa come in and are awesome together. I really think Kit and Ty will be a thing because remember, far in the future Clare said The Wicked Powers will be about two gay shadowhunters in love and I have a feeling it will be about them. There is a big emphasis on family in this, and I love it. Exploring Julian and Marks relationship, their roles have essentially reversed. When Mark was taken, he was the older one in charge who knew how to take care of the kids. Now, his time in Faerie has made him forget how to care for them and be stern with them, thats Julians role now. You can see they really love each other, but Julian gets frustrated by Mark and how hes not how he expected him to be which is sad. That whipping scene! Oh man, broke my heart. I sobbed. And then with that last chapter things will clearly not get better. Oh Mark, you just had to say it. And Emma may just go through with it because its not like she can explain why she wants a pretend boyfriend and ughh this is not gonna go well. Everyone has such unique personalities, but they all work together so well. Things I want exploredanswered: More knowledge on the parabatai thing, MORE JEM AND TESSA we barely saw them and I was hoping they would be more involved with Emma and co., Dianas secrets, Cristinas history and past with Diego and Jaime, mental illness among shadowhunters, Kit and his perhaps budding friendship with Ty, how Livvy will feel about this, and the aftermath of that Why lie? and epilogue. I just knew that epilogue was gonna happen, I knew it! Also, I refuse to believe Malcolm is dead until I see the body. Honestly, I think what you realize the most above all is that for the Blackthorns and Emma, family is everything. Oh, one more thing! THAT SPECIAL STORY AT THE END. SIMON AND IZZY ARE ENGAGED!!!! MY BABIES ARE OKAY!!!!! JACE PROPOSED TO CLARY BUT WE DONT KNOW IF SHE WILL SAY YES!!! Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Clares writing is spectacular and the characters are amazing. I still love TID the most, but who knows I may change my mind yet. Damn this is a long review... so sorry guys lol. Oh I almost forgot. Mark, youre a book boyfriend.
I read this book as an advance galley, long before it became a Thing and I did not read this book because I wanted Vance to explain Trump, though hes somehow been chosen by liberal media as the person to do just that though the handful of interviews I saw seemed more like Chris Matthews wanted to pat himself on the back for having a guest with hillbilly cred than actually listening to what Vance had to say. I didnt think this book would have mass appeal because no one outside of Appalachia seems to give a shit about Appalachia, and its success has surprised me. Its not a perfect book, but I do think its a good starting point as long as you remember that this is just one guys perspective on his own experiences. I picked this up because Vance is from the same part of the world as me and I wanted to read about something that I could relate to. That cover photo looks like it could have been taken on the road that I grew up on, in one of the poorest places in Ohio where Appalachia and the Midwest intersect. It was so poor that a girl who made me cry in first grade was featured on a CBS news story on American Poverty. I always knew it was different from the cities and suburbia reflected in pop culture, but moving away and realizing just how different it is from other places was still a weird experience for me. Its so rural that I struggle to describe it adequately to the people Ive met since living in Philadelphia and the DC Metro area. It matches stereotypes to some extent, but the stereotypes also often miss the mark. People not from Appalachia really dont get it, and theyre often way too quick to dismiss it. I never really fit in in Appalachia, for so many different reasons, but Ill also fiercely defend it. Put me in a room of EastCoast natives making jokes about uneducated rednecks and I will probably grow a second head. Poor rural white people are the last group that you can make fun of without being considered unPC, and I think thats a huge problem that creates a lot of divisiveness. Books like this one show a culture that is underrepresented. Vance grew up in a small town between Cincinnati and Dayton. TBH, I never really thought of that as Appalachian because Cincinnati is on the opposite side of the state from me, but Vances family moved north from Kentucky so of course it is. His family experienced many of the same migration patterns, cultural touchstones, and povertyrelated struggles that describe the lives of my extended family and the families of my highschool peers. His father was never a consistent presence in his life, his mother struggled with drug addiction. His grandparents were the greatest source of normalcy in his life, but they taught him to live by a hillbilly code of loyalty and selfsufficiency. Though they encouraged him to take his education seriously, wanted a better life for him than theyd had, he didnt do well in school and didnt seems to think hed ever have a future outside of Appalachia. But then he joined the Marines and it turned his life around. With a new sense of selfdetermination, a broader perspective of the larger world, and developed leadership skills, Vance enrolled at Ohio State University and, eventually, went on to Yale Law Schoolan unheard of achievement for someone from his family, his hometown, and his struggling public high school. A lot of the experiences he had in New Haven frustrated him, and that was definitely something I could relate to. However, I think those experiences caused Vance to dig into his conservative values in a way that I can not relate to. Theres been some sociocultural analysis of Appalachia, but I dont think anythings ever focused so specifically on Appalachia Ohio. Thats something that I definitely appreciated as a native. Im also unaware of any exploration of the region thats actually been done by a native and therefore possesses an insider understanding of what makes the people tick. There really are a lot of very specific personality traits that are unique to the ScotsIrish people who settled in the Ohio River Valley, and these traits make no sense to outsiders. When people talk about how ridiculous it is that West Virginia tends to vote Republican even though it seems to be against their interests, they are fundamentally misunderstanding a lot of these traits that are so ingrained in the psychology of the state and that frustrates me to no end. Vance focuses primarily on his own personal story. He does cite some research about the region in generalbut this is mostly for context and is not meant to be exhaustive. I think its important to remember that Vance is conservative, though he doesnt seem to be as far rightwing as the Tea Party, so his ideas may not appeal to the point of view of many liberals coming to this book trying to make sense of Trump. By giving this book four stars, thats not to say I necessarily agree with his political point of view but I think its important to hear different voices. Vance makes an attempt to extrapolate from his own experience to explain why simple social welfare is not enough to help address the problems of Appalachia. The short answer is: there are no easy solutions, because so many of the problems are circular. People dont succeed because they dont see anything to be hopeful about, and they dont see any room for hope because so few have succeeded. Without hope, no one bothers to take baby steps towards the kind of changes that can move the region into a better economic reality. I think some people see that as blaming the poor for being poorwhich is a thing that happens and is a gross oversimplificationbut I do think there are both internal and external factors at play here. I do wish Id come away from this book feeling a little more optimistic, that it offered up some more concrete solutions, but I suppose that wasnt really Vances stated purpose. And its not really something that falls squarely on his shoulders. Hes still youngjust 31, he likely only finished Yale two years before this book was written, if Ive done the math correctly. Perhaps concrete is something that he can bring with some more time? Or maybe hes just not the guy thats going to be bring concrete. Regardless, I do think its important to listen to the voices of Appalachia. Change is never going to happen until we all start listening to each other and not just applying our own prejudices to each others words.
Well, its been 4 months since I read and finished Six of Crows, so I think its about time I reviewed it. Or at least, TRY to. I still remember a lot about it, which is great, but I dont remember everything. So I hope I can still do this book justice, especially since over the course of those weeks, Ive thought about it often. And even started to reread it before its release date, but then I got into a really bad slump, and I sort of gave up on it. But I do want to reread it again, SOON, because its so worth the second look. I LOVED Leigh Bardugos trilogy, even with my lukewarm feelings toward Siege and Storm. I thought the ending to it was perfect; I adored the characters. I fell in love with the way she wrote, how she detailed everything and made it feel as if the world was real. And I was there. That didnt change at all in this companion; it was just a whole other area to such a fascinating world, one that I never knew about. Ketterdam is super different, yet also really similar, to Ravka. And this book can totally stand on its own; you dont have to read The Grisha Trilogy first. I do recommend it, just because itll give you so much background toward the places, and it even references two people, I think, from the other series. But its definitely not required. And I really liked that Six of Crows didnt need to be read after the trilogy. It was easy to separate what was happening in this, to what had happened before. And it was easy to fall in love with a new set of characters. Not that it was hard to fall for them. Not. At. All. If anything, these characters are so much easier to love than the ones in the trilogy. And not because theyre better, or more likable lolol this makes me laugh, but because there is just something about them that make my heart happy and give me so many feels. I fell HARD for them all, but especially Kaz Brekker. Its no secret that I love my broken bad boys, that I love the guys who are damaged and hurtful but who have softer sides to them. But hes so much more than that. His background shaped who he is, pushed him in so many ways, and became the driving force that turned him into the best thief in Ketterdam. And when you start to get to know him, beyond the manipulations and calculated ways in which he keeps his emotions in check and the thirst for power, you start to see exactly who he is. Not just a thief or a conman or a, lets be honest, a jerk. But someone who is just trying to survive in the only way he knows how to. I see that, and so does Inej. 3 She is, aside from Kaz, my favorite of the characters. Inej is a true badass, a boss queen who makes people bow down to her. I love this girl so much, and I just love that shes so powerful on her own. That she doesnt need anybody to save her. She is intelligent, quick on her feet, and deadly. Shes the heroine of her own story, a story that I NEED more background on since I feel like we still dont know her completely. But I loved the way she took control of her life, the way she didnt settle for anything less than what she deserved, even when she knew it could cost her. Her feelings for Kaz werent like a big deal; they were just a part of her. She didnt need romance or a guy to save her. And I needed that, because I feel like that doesnt happen often in YA books. The Wraith has such huge importance in this book, and I cannot wait for more of her. She is that AWESOME. The rest of the characters, Jesper, Wylan, Nina, and Matthias, all have big roles in the book as well. And I loved them too, but Kaz and Inej just hold my heart. Anyway, onto the others. Jesper is hilarious! Hes a sharpshooter who just lightens up the tense situations which makes him a little stereotypical, being THAT character, the comedic one, but hes not. Hes more than he appears, and hes not afraid of just being himself. le sigh I sure do love that guy. And so does someone else. cough Wylan, the privileged runaway, doesnt get as much time on the pages as everyone else and if I recall, he also doesnt even get a POV. But thats okay, because I have a feeling hell have a larger role in the sequel. Also, hes adorable, so well keep him. :D Nina the Heartrender and Matthias the convict had a bit of a history before this, so the sexual tension and unresolved issues between them was played to perfection. I adored how they werent a couple, but they were basically. The whole cast made for such fun and heartwarming dialogue inbetween all of the action. And there is A LOT of action, but the beginning is pretty slow. Leigh builds up the world carefully, and so detailed that it can make for a boring start which Ive heard from several people. But I was actually hooked from the beginning, and I think the largest part in why I love this book so much is because of the characters. They really make the story come alive, with all of their differences and backgrounds and personalities. The multiPOV is never a problem, because theyre all so unique, and the 3rd person narrative does make it easier to tell them apart, but I digress. Throughout the story, the characters are put to the test, and I just went crazy for the plot. The heist storyline had me intrigued, and I couldnt wait to see how it all came together. But man, that ending is a fucking killer and I am DYING for the sequel because I just have to know what happens to my beloved characters! Well. This was surprisingly easy to write, even after 4 months. So I think that goes to show just how much of an impact Six of Crows made on me. All I want is to dive back into this, but Im gonna make myself wait until closer to the sequels release date. But guys, this book is brilliant. It is rich and real and heartbreaking and funny and holy mother of God I just love this misfit group of characters SO much. 3 This is probably making me sound really crazy, but I JUST HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS FOR THEM OKAY PEOPLE?! Rating: 5 Paw Prints!
Becoming Calder Mia Sheridan 5 heart flooded stars!! I cant even begin to talk about this book. This book, ohhh this book!!! Be still my Calder heart. Ok let me take you on my roller coaster ride. Strap your self in...Im not sure how bumpy this ride may be. So I was lucky that when I emailed Mia and told her about my signed Archer book, that I won in a contest on her page, that my grandmother, who is still on the Im not lending you my books list, donated to the cancer center since she wanted them to read such a beautiful story..Yeah yeah yeah I get it , I understand, but it was my signed book!!!! So Mia talked me off the ledge of disowning my grandmother, and well she made me feel better by sending me Calder..Ok so she saved Nanny, but it was touch and go there for a second. So now I have Calder and Im petting my kindle, and talking softly to him...I was calmly telling him that Archer he has my heart, he made me a bowl full of folded chips, and even though he has my heart I shall be open to him, but dont get your hopes up, because I heart Archer..I swear I felt Calder smirk and I think in my head, or rather Mia wicked brain he said and I quote, Bring it on! There is a place in modern day America with no electricity, no plumbing, and no modern conveniences. In this place, there is no room for dreams, no space for selfexpression, and no tolerance for ambition. In this place, there is a boy with the body of a God and the heart of a warrior. He is strong and faithful and serves his family honorably. But he dares to dream of more. In a secluded community isolated by the real world, filled with no electricity, no plumping, no hot water basically they live in the past. Calders people, they are filled with a faith of their Gods, and devotions to their leader. Their leader is constantly teaching and telling them how they should live their lives, I mean he is the chosen one right? Or so he said so... It is in this world that Calder exists. We meet Calder when he is a10 years old boy, and a water worker in their world. It is here that he meets Eden. I craned my neck to see what everyone was looking at and thats when I saw her. A little girl, even smaller than Maya, walking slowly down the aisle, a look of terror on her face. I felt my own eyes grow large as I took her in. She was wearing a white, lace dress, like a tiny bride, and her pale blonde hair fell over her shoulders and down her back . And her face....I felt my heart lurch in my chest at the beauty of that small face. Her lips were full and pink and I could see that they were quivering slightly as her eyes darted around. Suddenly they fell on me and my breath hitched as our gazes met and held, her blinking and me starting. It is here where this friendship starts, but not without reservations, you see this angel, is their new mother even if shes eight. Well the Gods said so. As time goes on, and both grow up, this friendship is slowly stripped and a love of pure greatness is put in its place. But true love, you cant hide from it, you cant run from it. It takes over your body, your mind and your soul. As they grow up, hidden meetings by the spring, hidden teachings of math, science and floating, little butterscotches candies left behind, flowers left as a I miss you, secret kisses, and every single moment together grew into a all consuming love. Eden, Id kiss you long and Id kiss you often It is a forbidden love affair that will rock them to the very core of their existence I stared at her. She was captivating, amazing. And Gods help me, the seed of love that had taken root, the seed that I had vowed not to nourish, started to unfurl anyway. I swore I could feel the velvety tendrils moving through me, wrapping around the vital parts of who I was. I was helpless to stop it. She had invaded me. I was the field and she was the morning glory. I had been overtaken. Just like that. Or maybe not just like that maybe it had been growing for years. But in that moment, I recognized it for what it was. So what do you do, when you know that your heart beats with another, You know that you cant breath without him, you cant sleep without dreaming of his face, you crave his touch, you yearn for better, you want to wake up with him holding you. You chose to go against all Gods and pray that you make it out there alive and together. Im going to take you away from here, to a place where my bed is your bed, and my home is your home. And in that place, Ill never be more than an arms reach from you. I swear my heart was beating erratically through every single turn of this book. The words on the page literally sucked you into their world and you couldnt help feel them in your heart, you couldnt help hope that their love would overcome every thing. It also made me so frustrated I emailed Mia about 30 million times a day, begging her to tell me why why why they had to suffer without electricity and hot water, and why cant the path to true love be paved with morning glories and you just want them to live happily ever after!!! She denied all my questions and said just keep reading. It didnt help our friendship, but I prevailed.. I read every single word of this book and my heart; well my heart swelled with a love I thought belonged to another. Calder wedged in so tight I didnt even see it coming. Ive wanted you for so long. So long. Every waking minute, in my dreams, too. I want to bury myself in you, drown in you, and never come up for air. I want you to be mine, and only mine... You trust me, right? Swoon.... Calder kissed me in a way that made me believe I had not only always been his, but I would be his forever. In this life or any other. In his kiss was the promise that wherever he and I existed, we would belong to each other. Calder and Edens love was so freaking passionate, so mind blowing, so forbidden, so earth shattering and so whole hearted that you couldnt put it down. Once again Mia, and her evilness of her words have sucked me into this journey, and Im not sure I can survive it. But I cant let go, I cant look away, I have to know, I have to see if true love really survives. Becoming Calder is the story of good versus evil, fear versus bravery, and the truth that the light of love has always found its way into even the darkest of places... From the beginning of time, to the end of the world
Video review here:  Dont let the bastards grind you down. I read this in two days, nonstop. It started out a bit slow, but then 10 into, I couldnt put it down. Its a quiet kind of book that turned into such a compelling read that I found desperate to find out what happens. The Handmaids tale is set somewhere in America, a place called The Republic of Gilead, in an imagined dystopian future in which the book of Genesis and The Bible are implemented and followed pretty much word for word. The story follows our protagonist, Offred, thats not her real name but shes called that because she belongs to Commander Fred who shes assigned to, ergo Offred, and we never really find out what her real name is for the entire book. Offred is a Handmaid meaning that as a fertile woman, her only purpose in this world is to beget a child for another couple. Handmaids are uniformed in red and are covered from head to toe and are allowed no liberties of any kind. Her rights as a person are completely stripped from her. First of all, the writing. This is my first Atwood and I actually really enjoyed her writing style and think that this is the kind of book that would benefit from a reread. The writing is very beautiful. Its quiet, but the more you sink into the story the more complex you realise the whole depth of the story is. There were so many lines and quotes that took my breath away. Throughout the story, our protagonist would apologise to the reader for creating a scene that didnt happen because imagining an alternate madeup scenario is a remnant of her hopeful nature as well as a way for her to cope with the reality of what happened. Thats when the pain was at its keenest. There were so many beautiful lines. The atmosphere she creates, the feeling she leaves in you, its all very eerie and chilling and very disturbing. Thats another thing about this book. We could have had the point of view of a more determined character who wants to fight the system, a hero figure, like Offreds friend Moira, who attempts and succeeds at escaping for a while at least and has managed to still have a little bit of her fire. Instead, we have the point of view of Offred, who lets face it, could be any one of us. Not everyone is prepared to face and act heroic in the face of the constant threat of death and punishment when faced with strict rules of life. Most people just adjust to the life, miserably. And thats what Offreds character has done. She is not the typical hero of the story. This is just a story about a woman who has felt the repercussions of rebellion the first time she tries and fails to escape with her family, and who feels fear and actually buckles under the pressure of society. That makes her a scarily relatable character. Nevertheless, we do see her try to win small victories in the form of small rebellions, be it stealing butter and using it as lotion, which she is not allowed, leaving her room in the dark of night and strolling around the house, holding a mans gaze longer than she should... And this still shows that there still a little bit of her true self left. Even with everything taken away from her. There is a lot of pain in Offreds life because, Offred lives in a society where nothing belongs to her anymore, not her career, her money, her family, her independence, her body, or her name. She doesnt know what has become of her family and gets no closure that we know of. Not her mother, her daughter, or her husband. She does find out about her daughter, but even then, shes not allowed to feel anything because she has no claim over her daughter at all. And she also goes on to describe how painful it is the simple truth of not knowing where her husband, Luke, is alive or dead. She is left with imagining all kinds of vivid scenarios of what might have happened to him since the last time she saw him during their escape attempt and wishes that she was certain he was dead because then at least she would actually know what has become him and get the closure she is denied. Because a part of her will always, always wish and hope that someday he will come looking for her and her daughter and whisk them far away. There are several timelines in the book, you get her present day, you get her old life with her husband and daughter at the brink of all of these changes, and you get a look into her transformation into a handmaid. The change in the world happens bit by bit. Women are denied their jobs, their money, their independence, their families, and their bodies. The more you get glimpses and flashbacks into her past, the more you realise how much of a normal life she had before society changed. Reading it, I wasnt sure how long ago this new society had been around for. She had a job, a family, a child, a husband, her freedom as we know it today. And you get all of this in contrast to her present situation where she has nothing and any reminder of her old life is a memory she recalls distantly like nail polish, wearing sandals, smoking, reading Vogue she remembers it as something she hadnt thought of in years, something she hadnt seen or felt in a long time, so much so that she has forgotten the sensation or frivolous purpose of those things. This truly made me think, would I forget the feel of this or that if I had been deprived, nay denied, them for that many years? It really does plunge the reader into the story with the smallest particularities and made me think of the smallest details in my life, the smallest freedoms I take for granted and never give a seconds thought. The ending took me a second to grasp. During the very last bit, Historical Notes I didnt realise I was still reading the book. For a second I thought I was reading the authors note to the reader about the inspiration behind the story of something, but that chapter is a transcript of a lecture and it turns out that the entire book is a transcript from a recording that Offred left about her life as a Handmaid and everything weve read was her retelling. Historians are studying these tapes are trying to piece together what happened to this handmaid and make assumptions on who the people she mentioned are based on. So its kept very openended and we never quite find out what happened to Offred. Similar to the sense that offred never really gets her closure, really. Ive read some reviews comparing this book to Saudi Arabia or the Middle East and I just want to state in Islam and the Arab world, its not the norm to treat women like this, and its not a representation of a religion or a country the same way this book isnt a representation of Christianity or America in the future. I also feel like thats how the media portrays Islam and the Arab world, and I just want to say that this book, while fictitious, exemplifies extremism and fanaticism. In this sense, I feel like its an important read. A fictional cautionary tale. When I was reading it, I kept thinking, how the hell could something like this actually happen to a society? Its near impossible in this day and age, and yet, maybe its not. These things happen slowly until you dont realise its happening. Im only saying that extremism and fanaticism is prevalent in every religion if you choose to take it to the extreme. Any religion can be distorted and abused by fanatics and people who abuse their power. Recent events have only highlighted the extremely ugly side of what fanatics with guns can do to the image of a religion and slowly turn something you would read in a dystopian novel into a reality, and I suppose that is why most people who have reviewed this book stated that it is not as farfetched as we would like to believe.
Weve previously met Jane Tindall in Season for Surrender , shes Xaviers cousin and a bit wild. Now Jane has reached her majority and received a major disappointment: she has been informed by her cousin that he does not trust her with the sum of money that he has been keeping in trust for her. Xavier has, instead, reverted the amount to a dowry and Jane can only access the money when she gets married. But who would marry her? Shes a poor relation, with very little social connections and is socially awkward  so Jane does what Jane always does: she makes an outrageous plan to win herself a sum of money that would guarantee her independence. Except, the plan goes awry and Jane is now ten thousand pounds in debt  shes already gritting her teeth in anticipation of a lecture from Xavier, further confirming her unreliability. She would have to tell her cousin Xavier what she had done. He would pay the debut, but he would box her up forever. She had proven him right; she could not be trusted. Like a lapdog, she would be leashed and admonished, and she would have no money and never travel away or be anyone else besides poor and plain Jane.  Chapter 1 Edmund Ware, Baron Kirkpatrick, was not in the market for a wife. He just happened to be at the same house party as Jane was and had stepped in when the situation was getting out of hand. In order to save Jane, Edmund announces their betrothal  and, in order to honor Janes debt, Edmund offers to marry her in truth. It should have been an easy arrangement: Jane and Edmund enter into an amicable marriage, pay off Janes debt and live contently ever after. Except that Jane has always loved Edmund and makes the mistake of telling him of it  this in itself shouldnt be a problem but, apparently, for Edmund, it is. So this was what the truth would do. She had meant to keep her feelings a secret until she was sure of his, but she hadnt expected the revelation to kill his pleasure so completely. She shivered with what should have been the remnants of passion, but instead felt like a bonedeep chill. He pulled in a long, deep breath, pressing a fist against his abdomen. I didnt know. Then he turned back to her, drew the sheet up over her nude body, and sat back against the high wooden headboard. I didnt know, he repeated, eyes fixed upon the bed hanging. Im so sorry. Jane had not thought anything could increase her humiliation. It had grown so large and palpable, it was almost like a third person in the room. Lying between the,, laughing at her. Oh, you foolish girl. But she was wrong: the apology made the humiliation worse. The apology meant that he had not expected her to love him. That he didnt want her to love him. And why would that be? Because there wasnt a prayer of him returning her feeling.  Chapter 4 In most romance novels, love is the answer but, for Theresa Romains Season for Scandal, love is the question because Edmund Ware doesnt believe he deserves love. Our hero is burdened by his mistakes and has spent his entire adult life atoning for such sins. He has become the perfect gentleman: attentive to the quietest wallflower, solicitous to the unpopular ladies, and gracious to the everyone else. All of London loves him for this, but Jane hates being at the receiving end of such kindness. This forced goodness, this cruel kindness, this suffocating politeness isnt what Jane needs from her husband  what she needs from him is honesty. Jane wants to see Edmund and know Edmund beyond what he shows to the world but, while Edmund shares a little bit of himself with the world, he is unwilling to give more to the person who deserves it: his wife. I enjoyed the irony of Edmunds life: the epitome of generosity and goodness is also the most selfish person in the world. While he is busy atoning for the mistakes of his past, making time for everybody, he is overlooking Jane and creating a newer problem. But Jane isnt a victim or a martyr, either  at the beginning, she struck me as a bit selfserving with no sense of the consequences of her action. It irritated me that, when her plan failed, she immediately thoughtassumed Xavier would save her. Shes perfectly fine making rash decisions because theres always her cousin to fall back on. Jane needed to learn that she was liable for her own mistakes: and she learned it in the most spectacular way through her marriage to Edmund. This was a wonderful story about two characters, growing, developing and discovering themselves. True connections and discovery of self are the central explorations of the story: while Edmund was content with his regular doses of adoration, they never seemed to satisfy him. All the good he was doing, all the acts of atonement were all an attempt to fill an unfillable hole  and the only way to escape it was forgiveness. But whose? Janes been trying to find her place in the world, a place where she can rest her own possessions, which are few. She was making strides in this direction when she was allowed to paint Edmunds hall green but, her progress was stopped cold when Edmund went back to his old ways and left his wife alone to her own devices. Edmund counted to ten before he spoke. Do you mean that you were trying to please me by agreeing to attend tonight? And that I have not yet found an activity that will please you? Not an activity, exactly. She looked up at him, her eyes tawny as topaz. You give a piece of yourself to everyone who sits at the edge of a ballroom. But ... Edmund ... you married me. True. So. Dont you think we ... She trailed off. When she spoke again, her voice was carefully flat. I thought wed be together this evening. Not for the whole evening. Just part. Im with you right now. Are you?  Chapter 7 It is also interesting how the word self is used to prefix many other words, both with positive and negative connotations: selfassured vs. selfconscious, selfbelief vs. selfdoubt, etc. In that we see that the human self is a dichotomy: that we straddle a line between right and wrong. Though there is a villain in the story Turner, the greater conflict is internal: Edmund must face the demons of his past and Jane must battle with her present emotional needs if she and Edmund would have a chance of a good future. There is a sadness to Edmund and Janes situation and a helplessness: because only the two of them can fix their marriage  and it isnt something that can be fixed by a grand profession of love. Season for Scandal reflects on what makes a marriage work: love is a decision. This was another wonderful, wonderful addition to Theresa Romains Season series. There is one line in the whole novel that continues to haunt me and wring my heart a little bit each time I remember it: If only she didnt love him, he could have made her so happy.  Chapter 7
 spoiler alert  I have been reading this book again because a group on GR decided to tackle it. I thought that, despite the fact that this must be at least my third reading since college, I should surely develop a better understanding of what this book is about. Ultimately, I believe that I did.. Yes, the story is somewhat basic, a love triangle between three women. The pivotal woman, Robin Vote, over whom the other two distress themselves, never speaks. Instead, we are given indications of her activities, from the time she accepts a marriage proposal from a pseudobaron through her two female relationships and to the end of the story. One cannot help but believe that this book is based on the biographical dilemma experienced by Djuna Barnes, herself. Indeed, Barnes is one of the characters, Nora Flood, and her lover, Robin Vote, has been said to be Thelma Wood, Barnes real life love interest. The third woman, Jenny Petherbridge, is a remarkable character in the book and perhaps the most recognizable as possessing clearly identifiable human characteristics and activities. The other two women, along with the other supporting characters, all seem vaguely like a Freudian dream. This is both what makes this book intensely interesting and, at the same time, very difficult. Barnes writing is so very effective that one finds great difficulty in extricating oneself from these opioid reveries that seem to occur with regularity and take the place of conscious action. The writing was so effective that one never questioned why a character was unable to extricate himherself from some fate, but rather curious to look deep into a mirror, as it were, of ones own subconscious and wonder whether there were similar secrets at its core. I have often wondered if Jenny bore any similarity to Henriette Macrea Metcalf, the woman for whom Wood left Barnes and with whom she had a 16 year relationship. However, whether correct or not, this reading of the book has finally sharpened my focus as to, at least, the subject matter of this book. While it is confusing due to Barnes jumping from character to character and situation to situation, I read somewhere that Barnes described the book as something like ones lonely thoughts through the night. If we take that as the night part of the title, how should we not be able to add Thelma Wood as the wood portion of the title? Hence I tend to think that this book is not only a kind of quasidream of Barnes concerning Thelma Wood, but it demonstrates the significant progress the character which Wood makes through her life. Barnes said once that she was not a lesbian: she had only loved Thelma Wood. While Wood herself complained that Nightwood misrepresented her and thus ruined her life, one might be hard pressed to agree with her completely after reading her bio carefully. Still Nightwood is far from being a story about 3 lovers. For example, while Nightwood is about the very specific progression of the character of Robin from the beginning, in which we find her both desperately in need of being owned, it is also, at the same time, about a woman who is vehemently unhappy at losing her personal freedom. One might say that Barnes is just drawing on character flaws of a human being, but I sense that she is drawing a portrait of so much more than this. She is depicting the counterintuitive nature by which freedom of the soul is both required and a previous sense of being is crushed. Further, we find the historical theme, especially one of not only pessimism but of lies and dishonesty expressed from the very beginning when the false baron wishes to marry. These are not dreams, but fantasies, the desires of someone who is reaching back into the past for something to make real once more. He believes: Old Europe: aristocracy, nobility, royalty. . . . He felt that the great past might mend a little if he bowed low enough, if he succumbed and gave homage. Immediately after seeing Robin, Felix confesses to the doctor that he wished a son who would feel as he felt about the great past. It is a wish for a history which is essentially manufactured in memories and objects, but whose reality remains terrible and frightening. When Robin finds herself pregnant, she takes Catholic vows. We sense that she is searching for something against her nature, something she doesnt directly want but perhaps by doing such things, the inquietudes will cease in her own head. When she visits many different cathedrals to pray, we sense the desperation, but to know it, we have to understand it from others perspective. She talked to the nuns and they, feeling that they were looking at someone who would never be able to ask for, or receive, mercy, blessed her in their hearts and gave her a sprig of rose from the bush. Even those who meet her know that she is seeking something she cannot have. Later we find Robin asleep with the memoirs of the Marquis de Sade and a line is underscored: Et lui rendit pendant sa captivite les milles services quun amour devoue est seul capable de rendre. In this I think we are given the greatest insight into Robins character and distress, both the necessity to be bound through love and the overwhelming need to break free from bondage. Yet Robin must continue to do these acts of excess over and over in order to get her, excuse the expression, fix of freedom. But Robin, to her credit, finally figures it out. The last scenes, with Robin getting down on all fours and interfacing with the dog never made a great deal of sense to me, but it is ultimately the return to her animal primitive nature by which she finds, finally, a permanent sense of freedom. Then she began to bark also, crawling after him barking in a fit of laughter, obscene and touching. The dog began to cry then, running with her, headon with her head, as if to circumvent her: soft and slow her feet went padding. It is difficult, especially with so many bizarre characters in the book and on first reading, not to imagine that this is something akin to a prelude of animalhuman sex. Yet clearly this is nothing of the sort and it remains perhaps Barnes disappointment with the way in which others interpreted the book. It is, ultimately, not a book about perversity, although certainly there is enough legitimate perversity throughout the world in plain sight. This is, instead, in my opinion, a book about a woman going aginst the grain and seeking to find freedom through a new connection with a pure and coarse basic instinct of femininity. In some senses, this is a frightening proposition and in others it is liberating in the extreme. Perhaps Barnes intended it to be a little of both. Concerning Jenny, Barnes says, When she fell in love it was with a perfect fury of accumulated dishonesty; she became instantly a dealer in secondhand and therefore incalculable emotions. As, from the solid archives of usage, she had stolen or appropriated the dignity of speech, so she appropriated the most passionate love that she knew, Noras for Robin. She was a squatter by instinct. I interpret the term squatter in two ways, the first denigrating Jenny because she is taking everything which belongs to someone else without concern and second, that she is only female in the sense that she exhibits the ridiculous and the frenetic. It isnt that she saw her turning away from Barnes, but that she saw her turning away from herself. I have thought a great deal whether this was a sense of frustration over her inability to choose properly, at least according to Barnes, but I believe that she was saying a great deal more about the fear of those who will not make those choices to move forward in their lives and permanently avoid what Sartre called bad faith.
FINAL RATING: 4.40 STARS CATCHALL First off, I should start off by saying that while I liked Shatter Me, I didnt fall hopelessly in love with it or anything. It was a fun, unique story, but it had a lot of plot holes and ended up falling flat for me. Unravel Me, however, was an entirely different story. From the very first page, I was sucked in and I ended up loving it far more than I ever thought possible. The story grows deeper than ever and theres so much character development. THE HEROINE JULIETTE Juliette is so much stronger in this book than the last, and she continues to develop in this book. While before I found her whiny and annoying, in this book she really grows a backbone, stands up for herself, and makes her own decisions. I definitely found myself admiring her and I cannot tell you how much I love that she managed to find her courage. She only grew stronger as the book went on. She knows what she wants to believe, but she still finds the strength to question it. THE LOVE INTERESTS WARNER We find out Warners first name in this book, and let me tell you, it is damn sexy. Now that thats out of the way, well move on. In Destroy Me, which you really should read before Unravel Me, we get a deeper look into Warners character. In this book, we start to see that same view through Juliettes eyes, as she comes to see him differently than she did before. Hes still harsh, and possesses a lot of the same instincts as before, but he can be gentle and even kind too. Hes a very complex and complicated person and I feel like we may never truly know all of him. I love him a lot, if you cant tell. ADAM Adam has absolutely zero backbone, and hes really whiny and irritating. When Juliette has to tell him something he doesnt want to hear he starts acting like some lovestruck, clingy, hormoneridden teenage girl. It was really frustrating and while I do feel for him I thought he really needed to just move on and stop being so dependent and childish. I dont really have strong feelings toward him either way and he just kind of exists. THE SOLDIER KENJI Everyone loves Kenji, which is why there is no way I could not write about him. He has a very open and humorous personality, but in this book we also see a different side of him. Hes loyal to his cause, almost blindly so, and hes compassionate but doesnt put up with more than he feels he has too. I really like him, and feel that hes a good addition in particular because he offsets Juliette. THE PLOT Shatter Me and Unravel Me have entirely different plots, and I mean that in a good way. Shatter Me felt almost on the formulaic side, as if not too much effort was put into it. But Unravel Me felt so much better, with a fully fleshedout plot and much more development. There were also so many fabulous plot twists that I never saw coming. It starts off kind of slowly. Not too much happens at the very beginning other than us finding out a lot of new information. Theres very little action at first, and though it was pleasant to read it still kind of dragged a bit. I actually had a really difficult time getting into it at first. Once the action began, though, I was hooked. I couldnt stop reading it. Something new seemed to happen on every page, and it was especially interesting to see how it tied in with Destroy Me. There were a lot of unexpected directions taken and I was definitely impressed by the way everything fit together. The side plots were fantastic, too. I loved that you could actually see how they tied into the story, and they felt important. Sometimes, though, the powers of the characters, particularly those of Juliette, started to feel really ridiculous and overly done. I get having powers, even being stronger than others, but dude, youve got to draw the line somewhere. Unravel Me was so, so much better than Shatter Me. Theres so much more plot development, and the story is much more complex. Its truly a masterpiece, and something I loved despite my many reservations. THE ROMANCE Ah, the romance. Sweet, sweet romance. I love Warner, so I was so very, very happy to see the development of a romance between him and Juliette in this book. I love the chemistry between them, and its hot and heavy romance that I love. While I have read things steamier than the infamous Chapter 62, that was still one sexy scene. I like where this romance was when the book ended, too. Theres not some sort of perfect place to be in. And while Im not an Adam fan, I do feel for him, but he needs to move on. THE WRITING This is the most complicated thing to talk about. Taherehs writing has definitely improved from that of her first book, and shes clearly very talented. The thing is, her writing style is very unique. Thats all very well and fine, but its almost too poetic and abstract and can get confusing which leads to frustration. I truly do like it, but at times it got really annoying. Her word choice is excellent, and her dialogue sparkles, but her description in particular can be phrased in this really roundabout way. Still, it was more straightforward than before, which was nice. THE ENDING You know when you want a a book to end a certain way, but youre sure it wont, and then it does? Isnt that kind of the best feeling ever? Thats how I felt with Unravel Me. I was praying for it to end a certain way but I didnt think it would and when it took that unexpected twist I was so, so happy. The ending was perfect, and I have no complaints here. Its definitely a cliffhanger, and definitely meant to torture us while we wait for the next book. It leaves you desperate to know what happens next but theres not too much unfinished business at the same time. WRAPUP I loved, loved, loved Unravel Me and I will most definitely be waiting impatiently for the final book of the trilogy. I cannot wait to see where this story goes, and what Tahereh comes up with next. Would I recommend this? If you loved the first book or were on the fence about it like me, then yes, yes, yes! If you havent read the first book yet then based on how good this book was I would definitely recommend giving it a shot. Its a unique dystopian with some familiar elements but overall a wonderful second book. FINE. Read more of my reviews on Sparkles and Lightning!
Wow! Just wow! I honestly wish that I could give a book more stars. In my own personal opinion, that may have been the best ending to a series that Ive ever read. Ok, lets get down to business. Tess. I liked her a lot better in this book than in Prodigy. You can definitely see the growth in her character since the first book to the last. Her interaction with Day when she apologized to him was great, and I like that she realized that she doesnt have to rely on him for everything. She deserves a happy ending, and Day wasnt going to be able to give her that. Thomas. He has always been a character that I couldnt really stand, and he didnt disappoint in this book. I still cant believe that he was trying to earn Junes forgiveness or understanding. He killed her brother! He killed his best friend!! He knew that Metias loved him and he killed him anyway, and used that love against him. That is just messed up! On top of that, he was too loyal. Blindly loyal. Loyal to the Republic as a soldier, but not to the person who made you a soldier. Eden. My has Eden matured into a great character! His relationship with Day was truly heartwarming and he was absolutely adorable. Hes definitely learning from his big brother. The fact that he offered himself to be the Republics lab rat is something Day definitely would have done. Even after everything the Republic did, it was the noble and right thing to do, and he did it. I felt proud of Eden when he did that, like hes my own brother. But the twist with Eden was interesting. The fact that he wasnt patient zero, and that June was, was extraordinary. I didnt expect that and it showed that Marie knew what she was doing the whole time. Days illness. This is absolutely one of the most terrifying things Ive read in a book. Like, Ive read Fault in Our Stars, but there wasnt that much detail into the feelings of her lung cancer, besides that she had real breathing troubles sometimes. Ive read Maze Runner, but there is no pov from anyone with the Flare. But Day. Wow Day. His brain tumor was some scary stuff. Especially when he would have the attacks and not be able to even see. That was some vivid writing Marie! Anden. For some reason I felt that he was shady in Prodigy. But his only real crime is liking June. He can be ruthless sometimes, but thats whats needed from a Elector. June wouldve been a good Princeps because she knows how to keep him in check, but I want her to be happy, and so does Anden. I sincerely apologize for thinking you were shady, but I still dont like you 100. The Colonies Everything about them is just wrong. Thats all I have to say about that. Antartica. Antartica is a very interesting civilization. The video game living is an interesting concept, as well as being able to live on Antartica in the first place. It annoyed me that they were refusing to help and being condescending to Anden. The Day and June dynamic. Im just going to talk about them together since theyd overlap anyway. They are such a dysfunctional couple, but the fact that they work so hard to not be is adorable. I think they might be the ultimate book OTP. June struggles with forgiveness, and with letting Day forgive her for what shes done. On the other hand, Day struggles with trying to let her go when he gets sick. Day fails miserably, but he wasnt meant to succeed. That was the time that he needed her the most, not the time that he should be pushing her away. Im so happy that June finally told him she loved him, and the paper clip ring she gave him melted my heart. I loved seeing them reunited and stronger than ever. Even though June felt terrible for what she did, she knew that Day mostly forgave her and tried not to let that get in the way of anything. The final 40 or so pages includes last few chapters and epilogue I was literally on the verge of tears for the duration of these pages. No lie. I took breaks every five pages or so to compose myself so I wouldnt be one big puddle of feels. It didnt really work, I was still a mess. 1. Commander Jameson and June fight: This had been building, mostly inside of Junes head. She had to face her demons, and they were all embodied in everything Commander Jameson was. She finally got the upper hand and won. 2. Day getting shot: that was beyond sad and I couldnt process the fact that he was actually shot. TWICE! WHAT? I was really scared that Marie Lu was going to kill off the main character like some authors do... Im just happy that he was able to protect Eden and that Eden didnt get shot. 3. Junes desperate plea to the Heavens: this was one of the saddest scenes that Ive ever read. At the same time, I was mad at June for never showing Day how much he meant to her. From her prayer you were able to see all of the true feelings that logic kept her from telling Day, and I was really sad that he would never know the extent of her love. 4. Day meeting his mom: Ok, I stand corrected. THIS was one of the saddest scenes Ive ever read. But besides that, I like how his mom didnt welcome him. That may sound really cold, but I love how she wouldnt let him die that easily and how she told him to go back to Eden. 5. Day in the coma and Day waking up: Even though I titled this about Day, its really about June. I WAS CRYING SO HARD DURING THIS PART LIKE NO JUNE DONT LET HIM GO!!! Marie Lu outdid herself with that scene there. He didnt remember the pain, and so June tried to keep him from it by excluding herself. This was the most selfless thing June has done throughout the whole book series. I felt like June; I really didnt want her to do it but it was the right thing to do. 6. THE EPILOGUE!!!!!!!!!: Honestly, if the epilogue happened any other way, I would have thrown the book out the window. There was some serious foreshadowing in Prodigy that I give Marie Lu uber props for. June says that if she became Princeps Elect that they would have 10 years of barely seeing each other, and thats exactly what happened, but for different circumstances. I like how June tried to date Anden, cuz she really did like him, but that they broke up. Anden really does deserve someone who can love him better than she ever could. June at Metias grave was heartbreaking, but something she had to do. Her life will forever be changed again, because now she will have lived longer than he ever did. Tess and Pascao keeping touch with her was nice, and I love what Tess did for her. I was gonna yell at June for passing Day in the street and not saying anything. I jumped for joy when he went back. Though he didnt remember what happened between them, he knew that she was his missing piece. I dont think he could be sweeter if he tried. And Eden recognized her I think. I liked Edens ending. After everything he went through Im happy that it didnt stop him from getting the engineering job he wanted. AND DAY WAS STILL WEARING THE PAPER CLIP RING!!! That was literally the sweetest thing ever. And WHEN HE REMEMBERED HER!!! That was amazing. And they remet just like how he wanted them to have met in the first place. On the streets with a simple hi. That was absolutely amazing. SO. All in all, this book was one of the best endings Ive ever read. This series has went straight to the top as one of my favorite dystopian books of all time. Props to you, Marie Lu
This book was an amazing roller coaster of emotion, action, romance and fantasy. I LOVED IT! And now, I need to control myself after that ending and to clear my emotions to write all the things I loved about this book :  This book was epic! Amazing! I love how magnificent and perfect this books are. I have been waiting for this book since I finished CoHF, and right now I dont know how Im going to survive until 2017. I was fangirling all the time. I couldnt stop reading since the first page of the book and since then I was in a roller coaster of emotions. First of all, I love that we get to see more of the Shadowhunters world and more about the Faerie Realm; and also how is the life in other Institutes. I love that Cassie writes in such a beautiful way that the action and the mystery keeps you reading and reading until you finish the book. I love to have love, drama, mystery, funny parts, action and adventure. This book is perfection. And obviously I loved to have TMI characters intervention. I missed them so much. And about the characters... I loved Emma: shes so brave and badass and so funny. I love how in dramatic and tense moments she is capable of making jokes. I love how fierce and fearless she is. Jules, what can I say about you? My feelings towards him are so complicated. I love him but theres a little part of me that is kind of afraid of him; but I love how caring and loving he is with his brothers and sisters, and his passion for painting. Then is Mark...and my god! I just love him too. I love him. I simply loved Christina and one of the things I loved about her was her bravery and her kind personality. She is loyal and kind; and simply love to read phrases in Spanish and to read about Mexico in the book. The Blackthorns are an amazing family: I love how Dru is obsessed with horror movies, how Ty and Livvy are the nerds in the Institute and know everything about computers and Tavvy is so adorable... When you love someone, they become a part of who you are. Theyre in everything you do. Theyre in the air you breathe and the water you drink and the blood in your veins. Their touch stays on your skin and their voice stays in your ears and their thoughts stay in your mind. You know their dreams because their nightmares pierce your heart and their good dreams are your dreams too. And you dont think theyre perfect, but you know their flaws, the deepdown truth of them, and the shadows of all their secrets, and they dont frighten you away; in fact you love them more for it, because you dont want perfect. You want them. I cannot wait for the next book. I simply cant. Theres so much drama and suspense going on in the book and, even tough I tried to read it slowly, I finished this too soon. And now, I must fangirl all over the book because i really need to express my feelings: WTF!? sorry for the expression but theres no other word to express what Im feeling What was that?! That freaking ending. I literally wanted to enter the book and scream at Emma. She says to Mark that they need to pretend to be dating and then Mark says Why pretend? and I was like.... WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? I ship Mark and Christina so hard since the beginning. I want them to be together, I dont want to see her with Perfect Diego but at the same time I want her to be with Diego. And i dont know why, but the only thing Im certain is that I ship Mark and Christina. I think that she can heal the part of him that is suffering and broken, and I want so bad to see Mark being happy. Is there a name for this ship? Because in my mind the ship name is kind of weird. And I want Emma and Jules to be together. I dont care what the Law says I want them together. And when I was shipping so hard Mark and Christina and you read the scene where he is kissing Keiran, I was shocked. What in the world? Is Cassie trying to kill me? Then, when Kieran sees Mark talking with Christina and the next day he appears with the Leader of the Wild Hunt and he is going to be punished, and Jules interferes and he takes the lashes but then Emma knocked him out with a rune and then she takes the lashes... That was one of the hardest scenes I have ever read. Because just before the Faeries appeared Mark was saying to Julian that he was his brother and that he loved him. And Jules and Emma had knwoledge of each others feelings ... So yeah, Cassie wants to kill me. Jules and Emma. That scene in the beach is like Whoa, it took Jace six books and Will three to have sex and Jules less than a book. And also, since im talking about them, when Jem told Emma of what might happen if two parabatai fall in love was shocking. I have might suspected something like that because when Jules is hurt by the arrow and Emma remember her life with Jules and saves him and the rune has this weird glow; but still is shocking. I want them to be together and I think they are going to find a way to be together without getting mad and destroying themselves in the process. I absolutely loved the scene in the Lottery when they are dancing and they can feel each others feelings and when Emma is breaking up with Julian and he says that he wont give up on her... My poor heart And my complicated towards Julian are that I love the kind and loving part of him but like someone said because right now I dont remember who said it, he was a fierce heart... I never in my life imagined that Malcom was going to be the villain. He seemed so kind and funny, and the way he treated the Blackthorns was really nice. I actually tough it was Diana, because she was so mysterious and she rarely appeared in the Institute. But it shocked me. And that he was trying to bring to life his love that died many years ago. I actually thought that someone was trying to rise a demon or bring to life Sebastian and I was like not again, please. But now Annabelle is alive and we dont know how she is and what might happen. Then, you are casually reading the book and then this appears: On your feet, Christopher Herondale. Weve been looking for you for a long time. OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! THE LOST HERONDALE IS FINALLY HERE! AND TESSA IS THERE! AND JEM TOO! AND THE LOST HERONDALE! Too many feelings. I loved many things about this book. I cant even recall all the things I love, because if I do, this will be a loooong review. So now, I have to wait until 2017 to read the second book. So yeah, I finally finished my fangirl episode and the other thing I can do, other than wait until 2017, is give this perfect book 5 stars :D
Hands down one of my favorite freaking series of all freaking time!!! Such a satisfying ending to such a wonderful and fun story. Loved every bit of it. Cant wait to see what the writer has to offer after this gem. mild spoilers ahead My expectations were extremely high for this book, and it lived up to each one of them. I even voted for Winter on the goodreads choice awards before even reading it because I had that much faith in the writer. Few series have left me so satisfied. Writers always somehow manage to ruin the ending in one way or the other. And killing off your main characters has become a fashion nowadays. But, Im a sucker for happy endings, and this is why I love this book so much. It was joyful, fun and exciting AND had a happy ending. Happily ever after, hell yeah! All couples were great in their own way, but I especially loved ThroneCress more than any other couple. Have loved them since book 3. CinderKai come next. They are like a lighter and fun version of VinElend from Mistborn Trilogy. I couldnt bring myself into liking JacinWinter and ScarletWolf because of Winter and Wolf. I have problems with them. Crazy, Canine problems. But no character was unlikeable or hateful. I liked all of the characters. Even the bad ones. Their being so bad is what made this story so good, along with other things. That being said, behold the list of my favorite characters of this series, in descending order. Levana: Yes, the vicious, beautifulfromtheoutsidebutuglyinreality Levana. A good villain is the one who you wouldnt want to be in the same room with, and in her case, I wouldnt even want to be in the 100 miles radius from her. Shes so cruel, so very cruel and cunning and manipulative and evil that you cant help but just LOVE her evilness. Not like Joffery though. Joffery had no style and will go down in history as the most hated character of all time regardless of whether he was a good guy or bad. Levana makes a great bad guy and I just love that about her. Scarlet: I really liked Scarlet in this book. She went through great character development and really had time to shine, as opposite to book 2 and 3. She managed to boss around wolf soldiers, had the courage to lower her gun and let Cinder and Wolf go, had a heart to befriend Winter, and had the resolve to help Cinder in winning the war and not give up on Wolf. I really admired her character, and her potential was not wasted in this book. Kai: I just love Kai. He was nonjudgmental towards Cinder and the rampion crew. He was rebellious towards Levana, did not get intimidated by her and looked for moments to annoy her. It takes a lot of courage to stand up to the enemy who could manipulate you to do anything they wanted without batting an eye. Kai had that courage and that makes him a great character and emperor. Iko: Ah, who wouldnt love the machineyetmorehumanthanmosthumans Iko. She is the one way ticket to laughter and joy when things are starting to look glum. She is a friend everyone wishes they had. Her sarcasm knows no limits and her pervertedness has standards. I just love her so much and she is the star of this series despite being a side character. You go Iko! Cress: I loved Cress the moment she called Thorne Captain. Shes the sweetest girl of all but dont let that make you think that she isnt a strong one too. Shes extremely possessive regarding Thorne and yet blushes so adorably when hes around. Shes the smartest one of the crew but she doesnt acknowledge that fact. And when she sacrificed herself TWICE to save her friends, that was her definitive moment. Cress had the best character development in this series and she turned from a timid girl to a strong and brave one. Love her to the moon, space, Rampion and back. LOL! Cinder: Cinder is the kind of girl that Ive always wanted to see as a main character. I dont like passive aggressive heroines who are no fun, like Katniss, Tris or June. I mean I like them fine, but I LOVE heroines like Cinder, who are fun to be around and dont rely on other comic relief characters to make jokes. And I absolutely loved her friendship with Thorne. Honestly, if this werent a fairytale retelling, I might have shipped her with Thorne instead of Kai. Which I still kinda do. Maybe. And I just loved her when she decided not to take revenge from her step family even when she had the power, and instead fairly pointed out the chance of making money to them from her step fathers technology. Shes a strong and honest character with great leadership skills. And one of the best protagonists I have come around. Thorne: Oh, who would be my favorite character if not Captain Carswell Thorne. The best character of this series. The superstar. No, the Mega star. The ultimate definition of fun, friendship, loyalty and optimism. I admit I didnt like him much when he first appeared in book 2, but by the end of that book, he had become my favorite character and remained so throughout the series. He may appear like a fool or tactless, but hes one of the smartest of the bunch. He and Cinder made a great team in Book 2, and Cress made the best match for him. I just loved when all his confidence went out of the window when it came to Cress. Its hardest to say those words when you actually mean them. Although, I was anxious to see that him and Cress werent together even after the events of book 3, it was all so worth it in the end. And when he was being held hostage by Levana and lost his cool after stabbing Cinder, THAT was his definitive moment. It made us all see that hes not a heartless prick as people make him out to be, though I never believed that was heartless for a moment. But it was touching to see him freak out over Cress and Cinder, who are probably his most favorite people in the world. Captain Carswell Thorne, everyone! Im a bit sad because this series has ended. Though I am hoping we will get novellas and other stuff. I did read somewhere that there will be a book 5. I would love to have another book. This series has been the most fun. Like, THE most fun. I would love to see it adapted into a TV show. It would do great.
For more reviews and giveaways, go to Reviews from a Bookworm. I have to start this review by saying that I pity all those people who had to wait for Crown of Midnight. The wait would probably have killed me, I was so happy I could read it straight after Throne of Glass. I am petrified by the thought of having to wait for any books in this series. I need them all, now! I have so many feels when it comes to this book that it will be pretty hard to articulate them, but I will try my best! Me during part 1 of this book! This is only book two, people. Book two! And I am already completely obsessed to the point where its not even healthy. I even looked up Chaolaena fan art. I never look up fan art. I am turning into Cath from Fangirl and Throne of Glass is my Simon Snow. I would seek professional help but I dont want it. I just want Throne of Glass. Honestly, how am I expected to wait for future books in this series. How is anyone expected to go through that kind of agonising wait? HOW!?! Sometimes sequels of books you absolutely love can be ridiculously disappointing. Maas delivered me a sequel that was even more amazing than the first and that hit me in all of the feels. So, because I know youre all wondering, what is Celaena up to this time around? Shes now Kings Champion and its her duty to follow the Kings orders. Shes basically got to go kill whoever he tells her to because thats how he rolls. Plus, shes an assassin so its kind of her job anyway. But, not wanting to follow the orders of a man she despises, Celaena doesnt kill her targets. She warns them and then fakes their deaths. This was revealed to me in the blurb of my book so I was losing my sht before I even picked the book up. The King had warned her that he would basically kill Chaol and everyone she cares about if she didnt do what he asked. How dare she risk Chaols life? Does she not know that he is the fictional love of my life? Clearly not. But, Im getting distracted, the point is that she doesnt kill the targets. Instead she tries to help them escape whilst still convincing the King shes doing her job. Along the way shell find out about rebel groups and so much happens that it will make your head spin. Its amazing. READ IT! I looked back on my notes I made whilst reading this, to help me write my review, and laughed so hard. I have never seen so many OMGs, what the fucks or exclamation points in so few pages. So much happens in this book and it really does kick you in all the feels. The happy ones, the sad ones, the OMG ones and everything in between. It made me unbelievably happy only to then go and gut punch me and make me want to cry. And I loved every second of it. What is Maas doing to me? Chaol and Celaena in this book were almost too much for me. Almost. It is just rather obvious to me that they are totally meant to be, I was just waiting for them to realise it. The sexual tension between these too is ridiculous, it felt like the anticipation for those two to finally kiss might actually end up killing me. Chaol is just so determined not to cross the line with Celaena and it just makes the whole thing so much more fun. In all honesty, the first half of this book was completely dominated by those two. It was all Chaol and Celaena to me in the first half, I didnt see the second half coming at all. One thing I absolutely have to mention about this book is how much more hardcore Celaena is. In the first book she was all talk a lot of the time, but we didnt really get to see how good of an assassin she was. I always wanted to see for myself why she had earned the title of Adarlans Assassin. She didnt completely live up to the name for me during Throne of Glass. But she certainly makes up for it in this one. A flashback to a time in the Endovier mines blew me away. I finally saw just how dangerous, powerful and badass Celaena was. I was beyond impressed and I no longer questioned why people feared her. The emotional numbness set in at the start of part 2. As I have mentioned, this book has two parts. Part one was full of so many happy feels that I was floating on a giant cloud of happiness. I was wrapped up in the good ship Chaolaena, completely oblivious to what Maas was about to throw at me. Part two pretty much broke me, how I continued reading is beyond me. My feels were just not coping very well by that point. Maas had thrown so many plot twists at me that I was pretty sure what I was reading wasnt actually happening. I thought it was all a trick or something. Maas couldnt be doing this to me, could she? This sums up most of my part 2 feels: The first half of this book has all of the intrigue and mystery that you need. It keeps you guessing, shows you how hardcore Celaena is and is so good that you cant put the book down. It was everything I had hoped it would be and more, and it helped that it was all about the good ship Chaolaena to me. Maas delivered on everything and I had nothing to even complain about if I had wanted to. Then came part 2. It was gutting and devastating, it just about destroyed me. I am not quite sure how I continued reading it. A part of me didnt trust what I was reading. Maas is a genius when it comes to plot twists, so I naturally thought there was another plot twist around the corner that would piece my broken heart back together. The second half just had more twists then I could keep up with. I had a bit of a minimeltdown when reading it, I think my boyfriend began to suspect I had lost my mind. I had. 4.55 Butterflies I loved this book from beginning to end, but messing with my Chaolaena loses it 0.5. I also do this because 1. I will still give it 55 on Goodreads, as I round up 2. I know I need to save that 5, I will be needing it. These books are absolutely amazing and I cant express all the love that I have for them. All I can say is that Harry Potter will always be the ultimate series to me, nothing will ever touch it. But, Throne of Glass is the only series that has ever come close to it. I am obsessed! I can see myself at midnight releases for these books, breaking down the door to get the next book! I cant recommend this series enough. You need all the feels in your life!
This book was amazing! I loved it so much!!! I will do up a super duper proper review soon but you all need to know that this book was amazing and you need to put it on your shelves now. I LOVED the ending! I loved that it wasnt about the guy and the girl but about the girl becoming powerful and confident. This book was a Hunger Games for fantasty fans. I loved it so much! Heres the full review I posted on whatchYAreading.net: I loved this book. I shouldve said that sooner. The Girl of Fire and Thorns was fantastic and amazing and I really felt as if I had gone on a complete journey with Elisa by the end. I loved so much about this book, I dont even know where to begin. My thoughts are tripping over themselves so that my fingers remain motionless on the keyboard. Im going to split this review into three sections. The Plot, the Writing, and the Characters. The Plot. Isnt anything we havent seen before in fantasy. Though, is anything? A country on the brink of war with a chosen savior? Its a classic. I like the twist though. That the chosen person wasnt a warrior or beauty, or even a very motivated person. Elisa really is fat and lazy at the beginning. And she despises that part of herself and can think of nothing else. And one is left wondering how she will transform, how she will become what her country needs her to be. Which is, of course, the true plot of the book. The emergence of the chosen person and the sacrifices it takes to save a country on the brink of war. Theres a journey, sneakiness, poison, magic, battles, desperate escapes, and loss. Its everything a book about war should be. A Hunger Games for fantasy fans. Lets talk a little about what the plot isnt. It isnt a romance. Or a love triangle, though I can see where it might be marketed that way. There were two different men in Elisas life and they both had a profound impact upon her, in two different ways. Actually, I would argue that there are three men in her life but one isnt put forth as any kind of love interest...yet. Im kinda hoping that happens later. If there are going to be more books? I havent looked into it. Which is great as well! This could be a standalone but it could also be the first in a series. I love books like that. A book does not need an evil cliffhanger to leave me, and most readers, chomping at the bit for more. I loved that The Girl of Fire and Thorns wasnt about the guy and the girl but about the girl becoming powerful and confident. The Writing. It will make you want pastries. Almond flavored, preferably. I want one now. I want one a lot. I really just wanted to mention that I loved how the writing would speed up and then slow down. Its a tricky thing to do. Or, a risky thing to do. You will always have readers who feel like what they want to see is glossed over while the bits theyre not too interested in have too much detail. But I thought the balance was done well in this one. Some of the war scenes are in detail and some are...summarized is the only word I can think of, though it doesnt feel quite right. And, in the same manner, some of the character scenesromantic scenes are in detail while some are told in a more reflective manner. The balance felt right. I loved how everything was based I assume on Italian languageculture or possibly Spanish. I am woefully ignorant about both. It gave the book a feel reality and history and age. The world felt real because I could relate it to something I already thought of as having a long history. Again, assuming it is based on Italian culture. Also, I love the strong presence of religion in this book. It too gave the culture a real feel but didnt ever feel like it was preaching anything, you know? There is a lot of religion in this book but never did I feel like I needed to go and find this religion. The Characters. Were awesome. Mostly. There was one I didnt like. Elisa is just the right balance of selfdeprecating and determined. And all of the changes she goes through feel natural and you can really see how the quiet, lost girl at the beginning of the book became...well...became what she becomes at the end. I hate this nospoilers thing. I cant even mention one of my favourite characters because I dont want to spoil the neat twist there. Lets just say that Elisa has a female character that is her perfect foil and it is there relationship, not any of the romantic ones, that really made this book for me. The way these two characters regard one another throughout the book goes through so many incarnations and tests, and is really the most interesting of the relationships in the book. Alejandro, the king, was an intriguing character. Im still not sure what I thought about him. There were things I liked and things I didnt like. I did like the way the book ended with him. And theres nothing else I can say and remain vague. The one character I didnt really like, or well, didnt like the role he came to play, was Humberto. It might be awful of me to say but I really didnt like his name and that just biased me against him. And I didnt find that there was enough depth to him for me to believe that he became what he became to Elisa. Similarly to Alejandro, though, I did like how the book ended with him and I really enjoyed how his story affected the relationship between Elisa and her Foil character. And as for the character that Im hoping makes a bid for Elisas heart later...well...I dont want to reveal his name. But lets just say he reminds me of my favourite character from another political fantasy I read recently. Theres so much more to this book, but I feel like I cant say more without revealing more and what I loved the most about this book while reading it was that I honestly didnt know where the author was taking it. And I dont want to spoil that experience for anyone else. Im off to find some almond pastries. Read this book. PS: I really dont see what the title has to do with the book. Though I do like the title.
Excellent story. Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog Heartless by Marissa Meyer Publisher: Feiwel  Friends Publication Date: November 8, 2016 Rating: 4 stars Source: ARC sent by the publisher Summary from Goodreads: Long before she was the terror of Wonderland  the infamous Queen of Hearts  she was just a girl who wanted to fall in love. Catherine may be one of the most desired girls in Wonderland, and a favorite of the yetunmarried King of Hearts, but her interests lie elsewhere. A talented baker, all she wants is to open a shop with her best friend and supply the Kingdom of Hearts with delectable pastries and confections. But according to her mother, such a goal is unthinkable for the young woman who could be the next Queen. At a royal ball where Cath is expected to receive the kings marriage proposal, she meets Jest, the handsome and mysterious court joker. For the first time, she feels the pull of true attraction. At the risk of offending the King and infuriating her parents, she and Jest enter into an intense, secret courtship. Cath is determined to define her own destiny and fall in love on her terms. But in a land thriving with magic, madness, and monsters, fate has other plans. What I Liked: This book was incredible! Twisted, a bit dark, fascinating, and very heartbreaking. It is fabulously written, brilliantly told, and wonderfully executed. I know this a standalone but how cool would it be if Meyer wrote a follow up? This novel definitely stands on its own, but I would love to see where Meyer takes the story, if that were possible. More stories from this world would be so interesting! This is a prequel story to Alice in Wonderland, an imagining of a story never told. Who was the Queen of Hearts before Wonderland? It turns out that she was the daughter of a marquess and marchioness who liked to bake, and dreamed of opening her own bakery one day. But her parents have her on a tight leash. When the bumbling King of Hearts begins to court her, Cath feels despair and desperation like none other. But she also feelings the stirrings of passion, towards the new court Joker, Jest. Jest is magnetic and charming, kind and funny, and there is something that binds them to each other. But even Cath cant run from fate, and we all know the end to this story... I loved the world that Meyer has created! Since this is an imaginative prequel to Alice in Wonderland, Meyer has drawn a lot of aspects from Carrolls story. However, Meyer has really made things her own. This world resembles a regency London setting, with the ton and the dresses and the rigid control on daughters. But there is so much whimsy and fantastical creatures and happenings that are really cool too, that make this book so nonhistorical. I love how casually the fantastical aspects are put into the story! The caterpillar with all of its legs, the talking pumpkins, Cheshire the cat who can turn invisible... nothing seemed out of place or strange. Almost like magical realism in a historical setting! Brilliant. I admit, I wasnt Caths biggest fan initially. I liked her, but shes so spineless. Sure, shes a great baker and a good person, and she tries to make everyone happy. But that is her problem  her mother chooses her outfits, her daily outings, her facial expressions, her suitors. There were SO many times that I wanted to shake Cath or yell grow a spine! But I think this is all part of the story, all part of the process. Meyer deliberately makes Cath this way initially. But Cath grows little by little. At the end, Cath makes her own decisions finally! It took the whole book!, and I liked her even more. So many secondary characters worth mentioning! Jest, the court Joker and Caths love interest. He is sweet and charismatic, and I liked him. But he felt a little onedimensional, a little too perfect. I didnt love him in a book boyfriend kind of way, but I liked him. I liked Cheshire, as strange as he is. Hatta the Mad Hatter is awesome, as is Raven an actual raven. Caths parents are awful, and the King is an actual idiot. I thought I liked Mary Ann Caths maid but shes not that great, in the end. The romance is sweet, and its very slow. I thought there might be a love triangle, but the King is years older than Cath, and hes also like two feet tall, and basically Cath hates him and does not want to marry him. Jest and Cath are cute together, though not swoony. I would have loved to see more of what happened in Caths earlier dreams happen in real life... wink Oh goodness, where do I even start, with the story? There are bakeoffs and festivals, weird nonfriends and a Jabberwocky. There is an entire subplot involving the other kingdoms Red Queen, White Queen, and why certain things are in motion. This isnt just a story of how Cath got to where we know shell be  its a story of how Wonderland got to where we know it will be. The ending! Oh my heart. The ending is cruel and heartbreaking and I almost dislike it, except that it is perfect. It is horrendously cruel, but exactly what this story needed. So fitting, for the prequel. You all know how much I like a strong HEA, but this story ended exactly as it should have. Cath transforms into the character we expect the Queen of Hearts to be, which was heartbreaking but also very fitting! What I Did Not Like: I would have loved to see more in terms of Cath and Jests physical relationship! Like in Caths earlier dreams. More swoon would have been great. I found Jest a little onedimensional, so that could have contributed to the lack of swoon. The romance itself was sweet, and very shippable, but it wasnt swoony! Would I Recommend It: Dont read this if youre deadset on reading a book with a happy ending. However, this book was excellent. I definitely recommend it if you liked Alice in Wonderland. And if youre like me and have never readwatched Alice in Wonderland, I still recommend the book. Its a great prequel! Just not one with a happy ending ...which we expect. Rating: 4 stars. The hype is real, and deserved! It would be so cool if Meyer wrote a retelling of Alice in Wonderland from the Queen of Hearts perspective. I imagine it would be extremely different, and very fascinating!
There are good days and hard days for meeven now. Dont let the hard days win. A Court of Mist and Fury exceeded the first book in this trilogy in every way, the plot was intricate, entertaining, beautiful and I found no faults. I recommend this series to everyone! Please note, quick disclaimer: this is not a young adult book. If young adult is what you are looking for, or you are a young reader, I do not recommend this for you. This is a new adult series for mature readers and has mature content Since this is a review, below is spoiler central, if you havent read the book, dont read any further. You have been warned. A Court of Mist and Fury is the second book in the Court of Thorns and Roses TrilogySeries not sure which it keeps changing and it delivered over and above what A Court of Thorns and Roses did. A Court of Mist and Fury picks up in the Spring Court after Feyre has saved the Fae from Amarantha under the mountain. Feyre is dealing with the aftermath of what she did to save Tamlin, and as we begin three months down the track she is not fairing well. Rhysand has not collected on his bargain yet, but we follow Feyre and her life trying to deal with who she is, what she has become and where she belongs in Prythian. This Book is everything and more! Captivating, exciting, unique, funny, beautiful, romantic, heated, emotional and packed with so much action! You name it, ACOMAF has it! Sarah J. Maas has a way with world building, and her writing is full of descriptions that allow us to really see the world she has created and appreciate it for what it is. I appreciate the time she took to describe the beauty of Velaris, and why it was so important to Rhysand to protect. I liked the idea of Velaris as a whole, a beautiful piece of Prythian left untouched from the hands of Amarantha, and a place where Rhys and the inner circle call home. The plot was so fast paced in A Court of Mist and Fury, and it was astonishing how much happened in 624 pages. I felt we learnt endless amounts about so many people and places in such a quick time frame, as well as that, we had a full developed plot that was getting us closer to the endgame of the story... Even though I dont even know what that is currently. I couldnt of asked for a more perfect plot to the second story. There was no second book syndrome up in here! Feyre Darling Feyre was really suffering in A Court of Mist and Fury, she was in such a dark place at the beginning and the development she had in this book has to be recognised as nothing less than amazing. She went in broken, beaten and in pain, and at the end she was a weapon and a survivor and nothing could take that away from her. Shes such a wonderful character, and shes so powerful that I cannot wait for her to unleash on the world. Then we move on to the beautiful Rhysand and thankyou to Queen Maas for giving us such a character that is not only powerful but gentle, sexy and layered! He was someone I went it thinking I would hate, but wow was I wrong. I enjoyed seeing he wasnt one dimensional, Sarah could of easily made a sexy character that we would all swoon over. Instead she made Rhysand, who was just as broken as Feyre, who had endured and protected his people for 50 years while he was a whore to ensure their safety. He sacrificed himself for his people, he did unspeakable things for his people, and I think that shows what a exceptional leader he is. He was nothing less than perfect, I would almost say he was more than perfect if that existed. Tamlin. Tamlin Tamlin... Now I will rant about him in a moment but I wanted to touch on his character first, and the fact that Tamlins love for Feyre literally made him stupid. In ACOMAF he became overbearing, possessive and irrational. He didnt see the relationship for the toxicity that it became, it definitely wasnt like that in ACOTAR. He was exactly what Feyre needed at that time, however in A Court of Mist and Fury she didnt need a protector, she needed someone to help her deal with what happened under the mountain, she needed someone to help her understand and control her powers and he did nothing but sweep them under the rug, and act like problems werent there. The biggest problem I had with Tamlin was that he declared that Feyre was his property and that he would consort with enemy forces that are set to destroy them just to ensure she was back with him. One of my biggest pet peeves is men who think they own a woman, and Sarah really tugged on my hate of that in this one. A great addition to the character development though, I do like how she flipped our feelings completely, from a lovable character to one I now despise. Other than Rhysand, there was another group of people that won my heart in A Court of Mist and Fury, and that was the inner circle... I am 100 fangirling on the inner circle, I love all of them as a unit, and when looked at individually they all hold up perfectly as indepth characters. Not one of the inner circle was carried by the others, they were all perfectly crafted and created a fantastic dynamic together. Honestly, I could read about the inner circle for a whole spin off series. I adore them. Now, this is the moment you are all waiting for. This is the moment my friend Jade from Jadeyraereads is waiting for also, so you can join Jade in this enjoyment of me eating my words. Abandon fucking ship. I was happily sailing my Feylin ship, and then shit got real. Feylin died within me, I really held on but Tamlin destroyed any hope of anyone staying on his side. Here begins my rant, so I apologise for a few brief moments. HOW DARE TAMLIN BREAK MY HEART LIKE THIS! HOW DARE HE THINK FEYRE IS HIS PROPERTY! HOW DARE HE TELL LUCIEN TO TAKE HER AGAINST HER WILL! HOW DARE HE LOCK HER UP! and then he went next level HOW DARE HE SELL OUT HIS OWN COUNTRY, HIS PEOPLE AND PRYTHIAN! HOW DARE HE BREATHE AFTER THE SHIT HE PULLED! Also side shade for Lucien, because right now he is also on the traitor boat, that I hope gets blown up. My friend through many dangers. My lover who had healed my broken and weary soul. My mate who had waited for me against all hope, despite all odds. As one door closes another one opens, enter the absolute god of a High Lord Rhysand! The whole fandom squeals with excitement and yes I am with them also! I appreciated everything about Feysand and their relationship. I like that it wasnt instant and it was a long burning development throughout the whole book, it was wonderful the development and fully appreciate that they were perfection together. He didnt hold a leash on her, and more than that he appreciated that she was a force to be reckoned with on her own. He also didnt shut her out of the workings of his Court, he brought her in and showed her his world. He didnt want to run his Court and have her as a wife, he wanted them to run it together. I love it. I ship it. I apologise for not reading ACOMAF sooner. Overall, this book was everything I didnt know I wanted. I was skeptical because I loved how ACOTAR ended, but Sarah J. Maas pulled me in and filled my soul with everything I said I didnt want, and I ended up LOVING IT! And so Tamlin unwittingly led the High Lady of the Night Court into the heart of his territory. Now, off you go High Lady of the Night Court and destroy them in ACOWAR. I am out for blood. Favourite Moment: EVERY MOMENT. Cannot even answer that. Favourite Quote: I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again I would not, could not be broken. Tamed. Rating: 55
You know that feeling, she said, when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing close around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage, and you cannot let go or turn the course aside. This was essentially how Tessa and I approached the last book in Cassandra Clares Infernal Devices series. If you follow my blog at all you know that I have a pathological dislike of love triangles. I think the third book is where they usually fall apart, and I was upset by another triangle series that recently concluded that I had previously adored. Because this series has the trickiest love situation I have ever seen, I was very wary about starting Clockwork Princess. Thankfully, I have thus far had tremendous faith in Clares writing. I know she plots her series mercilessly, so I was hopeful that she would give her characters the ending they deserve, and that while undoubtedly painful, it would also be satisfying. In the end, I believe she accomplished exactly that. Of course, Ms. Clare doesnt make anything easy for her readers. Going into the final book in this series, she had created an impressively complicated knot of love between Will, Jem and Tessa. Lets break it down. Beware of SPOILERS for the previous 2 books in the listing, skip to the paragraph below this section if you havent read them. Jem loves Tessa. Tessa loves Jem. Will also loves Tessa. Tessa loves Will too. Will and Jem are best friends and parabati. Jem and Tessa are engaged. Jem does not know that Will loves Tessa. Will does not know that Tessa loves him back. Jem does not know that Tessa loves Will. Jem is dying. There is no cure for his disease. Jem dying will destroy Will. Jem dying will destroy Tessa. Will is determined not to benefit from Jems death and will not be with Tessa when Jem is gone. I dont think the fact that Tessa and I thought that she was barreling towards an enormous precipice of tragedy is that unreasonable under the circumstances. However, for me, the more important point about this complicated love triangle, and what has set it apart from any triangle Ive read before, is the fact that it is a true threeway relationship. Will, Tessa and Jem all love each other. If one of them falls, they ALL loose something. Throughout this story, I was continually amazed at how strongly Clare was able to emotionally tie them all together  and me to them. Even more, none of them had absolute power over the others, which is the case in most triangles where the girl is the one holding all the cards and essentially has to pick which heart to break. Every decisionoutcome came with a sacrifice for all of them. Another part of this story that I loved, for itself and also for how it enhanced the love triangle, was the Victorian setting. Clare for the most part kept her characters mentally within the confines of that world. People living in Victorian England lived under a very different set of social rules than we do today, including a strict code of propriety and decorum. I think the historical time period helped me to focus on the high emotional content of the triangle, without suffering through some of the more annoying features of most love triangles i.e. a constant back and forth between the two guys. Dont get me wrong, there are some great kissing scenes throughout this series, involving both guys. But that wasnt the focus of this series, as much as how their love for one another impacted each individual relationship. I think the story worked better because of that. Although for me, the main focus of Clockwork Princess  at least emotionally  was the love triangle, that is in no way all that happens in this book. These characters face very stressful life and death situations outside of their own personal dramas, especially from Mortmain and his Infernal Devices. If youve read the first two books and want a reminder about whats going on when this one begins, click here: At the start of the book, Mortmain is still out there plotting evil things with his mechanical devices, Benedict Lightwood has demon pox, Jessamine is in prison, Charlotte is pregnant and her position is being threatened by the Clave because shes a woman who thinks for herself, Gideon has left his family home and is in love with Sophie the maid, Cecily has just shown up at the institute, and of course most importantly Jem is dying, and there is no cure.  Amazingly, Clare ties off all the loose end from the previous books including questions about Tessas origins, and answers new ones from this book. There are also lots of incredible secondary characters, who have their own relationship issues, all of whose stories I was highly invested in. One of my favorite parts of this book was seeing the small connections between this series and the Mortal Instruments. You arent missing anything if youve not read both series, but it was a fun addition to the plot. Clockwork Princess is Cassandra Clares strongest written book. The story took me longer than it should have to read, because I was focusing so much on her characters incredible words and thoughts. Clare has said that this series is a loose retelling of A Tale of Two Cities, and the way that Dickens story weaves into this one, was particularly moving. One thing that continues to impress me about this author is how well she knows the inside of her characters, and as a result how very complex they all are. But most of all I appreciate the grace she has shown to Tessa, Will and Jem. Although this book is incredibly heartbreaking at times, and each of the three carries burdens and faces impossible sacrifices, I felt like they all would be proud of their place in this story and in each others lives. Love Triangle Factor: HIGH all around  but I still loved this book! Cliffhanger Scale: Series conclusion. Loose ends are tied. No room for a sequel for these characters. A personal note: As much as I loved this book, I still dont really understand love triangles. Although I got caught up in Tessas world, and can completely understand how you can love multiple people in your lifetime, I rolled my eyes a few times at how much Tessa was equally in love with both guys at the same time. I truly wanted it to work out for all of them  which is a testament to how well Clare crafted her characters and their story, but I think my heart will always romantically choose one over the other. But that just explains how amazing this series is, because I still believe that this triangle was extremely well done and satisfying, and that you should read it.
OHMYGOD I SHOULD NOT HAVE READ THIS!! This short story was sweet and had all of the wonderful characters from The Mortal Instruments and then some. I am so glad that Simon and Isabelle are finally getting married. Who would have thought these two would end up getting married after reading City of Bones? Not me, thats for sure. I totally shipped them when the idea became possible, but I never would have thought they would end up together during the beginning. Theyre perfect together. Im also really happy for Magnus and Alec! Things are so great for them. I only fear what will happen to Magnus years from now, when something happens to Alec. It makes me so sad that Magnus will live forever while Alec will die someday... Also.... WHY WOULD CLARY HESITATE?? She WANTS to marry Jace so why did she hesitate? WHY CASSANDRA WHY?! I CANT WAIT UNTIL MAY TO FIND OUT www.ashleyearley.com www.ashleyearleybooks.tumblr.com www.ashleyearleywrites.blogspot.com Ashley Earley Merged review: Usually, I talk about the writing first. However, seeing how the book is by Cassandra Clare, there really isnt a need. I think we all can agree that her writing is pretty consistent and wonderful. Her characters are equally as wonderful, but were going to talk about them. Unexpectedly, the book started up from the perspective of a brand new character named Kit. This surprised me because I was expecting to be reading through the eyes of Emma Carstairs. I jumped into this book not knowing much about it. I didnt know what the plot would hold. The only thing I was sure of was that there would be some sort of relationship between Emma and Julian that went beyond their parabatai bond. There were a lot of things that caught me off guard about this book. It could have been because I refrained from finding out anything about the book, but regardless, I was still surprised a few times. The Cold Peace, for instance. The law went as far as to punish any Shadowhunters that interfered with Fair Folk business. Mark and Helen Blackthorn are both part Fey, so this concerned me. But we were quickly caught up to speed in the first few pages of Lady Midnight. I was expecting Mark Blackthorn to return, but not in the condition that he was in. I had no idea he would have been tortured and put through so many harsh things. I felt awful for him, especially when he would rock himself in a corner, crying and screaming. Another shock was that he had fallen in love while living with the Wild Hunt. After Mark spoke of the cruel ways of the Hunt, I was shocked to find that he had found someone to love, and someone that loved him in return. This person for Mark was Kieran. The Fey love just as aggressively as they can be fierce. Kierans sad betrayal toward Mark was disappointing in the end. He hadnt meant to hurt anyone. He had only wanted Mark returned to the Wild Huntand to him. He only wanted Mark back, but instead, he had nearly risked the lives of Emma and Julian. This left Mark unable to forgive him, breaking off their relationship. Now, lets talk about Emma and Julian. Julian is a really sweet person that is strong enough to take care of all of his siblings without the help of anyone else, aside from Emma, at least. Jules carried the weight of learning how to take care of his siblings Livia, Tiberius, Drusilla, and Octavia at the age of twelve, along with dealing with his lunacy uncle and leading the Institute. And now, he has to care for his changed halfbrother, Mark. Emma is just as strong and fierce as she was when we first met her in City of Heavenly Fire, if not more so. She is brave and looks after those she loves, though she does feel slightly out of place among the Blackthorn Family. She feels lost without knowing what truly happened to her parents during the Dark War, refusing to believe that Sebastian and his army was the cause of their demise. She cares for the Blackthorn children just as much as Julian even though she feels out of place sometimes. Together, they definitely have chemistry. There IS something there, and there were some parts that were really hot and steamy! I loved it! I especially loved the scene where Julian got hurt and Emma was having trouble healing him. It was SO HOT! What Emma plans to do now is hard for me to swallow. I dont want her to hurt Jules, even though I know shes trying to protect him. I have no idea what is going to happen next. If their romantic relationship starts up, what will happen? If theyre found out, theyll be stripped of their Marks. I really have no idea where this could go and its driving me mad! I NEED TO KNOW!! The Blackthorn Children are older now and getting to know them was nice. I love how they interact! I loved how Edgar Allan Poes poem, Annabel Lee, was entwined with the storyplot. Im not a huge fan of Poe, but I really like Annabel Lee. It was genius how Cassandra Clare mixed it into the story. Malcolms betrayal toward the Blackthorns is sad. His story is even sadder, for he lost his love Annabel Blackthorn. He wanted to bring her back after her own family had killed her, all because she had fallen in love with Malcolm a warlock. It was a bit of a shock for me. After reading about how he interacted and cared for the Blackthorns, I hadnt seen him as anything but a sweet and caring person. A Magnus Bane of this series, if you will. I think thats why Cassandra Clare made Malcolm the socalled bad guy. She knew that her fans would be expecting Malcolm to be another Magnus Bane and look to love him in the same way. IT WORKED. The plot was carefully planned and carried out excellently. Seeing older characters from both The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices was amazing! It made me ridiculously happy to see Alec, Magnus, Clary, Jace, Tessa, and Jem! I love them all, especially Jem. Every time I read Jems name, I literally smiled, because he is my favorite character out of all of Cassandra Clares books. However, I was really sad when Jem got up to leave the room during speeches at Emma and Julians parabatai ceremony. Hearing others talk about their parabatai had been too much to bear after losing his parabatai, Will Herondale. I hope to see more of these characters in the future books in this series. JEM! COME BACK TO ME! I only really have one complaint about the book. The last chapter was slightly rushed. It jumped from the perspective of one character to another. And, more importantly, I felt that Emma didnt have time to process that shed learned of who had killed her parents. She found out who killed them and didnt have time to think about it! She didnt process and she didnt get to see how she felt about taking the revenge shes wanted for the last FIVE YEARS. And the last thing I have to say is.....I CANNOT WAIT FOR LORD OF SHADOWS!! The cover is amazing! BRING. IT. ON. www.ashleyearley.com www.ashleyearleybooks.tumblr.com www.ashleyearleywrites.blogspot.com Ashley Earley Song: Capsize
4.5 The problem with wanting, he whispered, his mouth trailing along my jaw until it hovered over my lips. Is that it makes us weak. Oh the Darkling.... So this book starts off with a bang and jumps right into the enchanting world of Ravka. We follow our lead girl, Alina, who is an orphan as she struggles with a newfound power. Basically this country, which is very reminiscent to Russsia, has been a split up by something called The Fold. The Fold is this stream of complete and utter darkness that spans across a part of the country and has hidden monsters inside. When Alina shows this crazy ability when they enter the fold, shes whisked off to join the Grisha. The Grisha live like utter royalty and they each have different types of abilities. From there the story takes off and goes to some pretty epic places.  Ive been wishing for you a long time Alina, he said. You and I are going to change the world. Leigh Bardugo does a fantastic job of throwing you completely into this world. Right away were giving new words, a map, and shown how this world works. She throws us in, but unravels the world in such a way that its explained as it goes. Its so intriguing that its hard to stop reading and the world is absolutely mesmerizing. However, I was a little confused even though I was enjoying it? I really loved the world building and how she decided to explain it to us but I was still kind of confused and wish it had been explained a little more clearly. Like by the end of this book, I understand most of it, but some of the terms Im still a little confused by. Hopefully that will be cleared up in the next book. Youre shaking. Im not used to people trying to kill me. Really? I hardly notice anymore. Now the highlight of this book for me was the characters. I will say that I did find Alina a little bit annoying, but I can see a lot of potential for character growth, which we already started to see by the end of this one. I didnt like how she was always so down on herself. But I did grow to like her as the story went on. And I loved her friendship with Genya! I thought that was a really nice touch, since she never really had another friend besides Mal. Oh Mal... I missed you every hour. And you know what the worst part was? It caught me completely by surprise. Id catch myself just walking around to find you, not for any reason, just out of habit, because Id seen something I wanted to tell you about or because I wanted to hear your voice. And then Id realize that you werent there anymore, and every time, every single time, it was like having the wind knocked it of me. Ive risked my life for you. Ive walked half the length of Ravka for you, and Id do it again and again and again and again just to be with you, just to starve with you and freeze with you and hear you complain about hard cheese every day. So dont tell me why we dont belong together. He said fiercely. swoon I loved Mal! At first he was just okay to me but throughout the second half the book he really grew into his own. And I love him with Alina!! Im not like you Mal, I never really fit in the way you did. I never really belonged anywhere. You belonged with me. Theyre so cute together! Mal just says all the right things! Ahh! And that ending I was completely dying. I dont care if you danced naked on the roof of the Little Palace with him. I love you Alina, even the part of you that loved him. Now lets talk about THE DARKLING. This was his soul made flesh, the truth of him laid bare in the blazing sun, shorn of mystery and shadow. This was the truth behind the handsome face and miraculous powers, the truth that was the dead and empty space between the stars, a wasteland peopled by frightened monsters. Am I crazy for still loving him? Hes so MYSTERIOUS AND COMPLEX. So many different layers. Hes so twisted but such an interesting character. I went from swooning over him to being nervous around him, then swooning some more, and then frustrated and mad at him. All of the emotions over one character in a book thats just over 350 pages. All the awards to Leigh Bardugo on that one. The Darkling slumped back in his chair. Fine, he said with a weary shrug. Make me your villain. Hes definitely just someone that you love to hate in the best way. I cant wait to find out more about him and hoping for some awesome character development. Did you tell him what I showed you in the dark? ugh why does he have to be so evil and so hot Then that EPIC ENDING!! I loved how the beginning came full circle to the end of the book. It was so perfect! Leigh Bardugo really did an amazing job with twisting your emotions all over the place. I was actually terrified of the idea of the Fold but then towards the end my emotions did a complete 180 towards it. Why can a Grisha possess but one amplifier? I will answer this instead: What is infinite? The universe and the greed of men. Overall this book was a great start to what is definitely going to be an awesome and epic series. Cant wait to read more! Mal, I whispered into the night. What? Thanks for finding me. Always.
Actual Rating: 3.75 I actually had to sit this out a little bit before I decided to rate and review it because while I definitely enjoyed this book, there were some things that were really...bothersome to me. Overall this is a pretty solid read. I will admit, I was expecting a little bit more from it considering people are going so crazy over this series at the moment, but it is the first book and so I dont doubt that the others will improve. For me though, this just wasnt as good as I would have liked it to be, even though I did really enjoy reading it. Falling Kingdoms was an interesting story to read. There were many different elements at play that kept me involved and wanting to read. Theres politics, fighting, love, death, betrayal and magic. This first book was definitely a building block for the rest of the series but a lot of what happened was predictable and I could see the outcome of a given situation chapters before it actually happened. Ive read other fantasy series like this one before and while they were all YA, I just feel like they had a much more mature tone and feel to it. Falling Kingdoms definitely FELT like it belonged in the YA category and Im not used to that happening with these kinds of books. Its weird because, while I definitely enjoyed this book and what was going on, I didnt really connect with anything. Not the plot or what was happening in the world, the characters or what was going on with them. I was interested in the characters because they all had some very weird and heavy stuff going on with them, but as far as having an emotional connection to the story or caring about what happened to each character, there was really nothing. I think that has to do with the fact that Morgan Rhodes has NO problem whatsoever killing off her characters. In the first three chapters someone died...In EACH chapter. It was crazy. As soon as I would get a little bit comfortable that some of the characters I was reading about were safe, or as soon as I thought I was being introduced to a character that was going to be important to the outcome of the story, she killed them! Also the story is told from multiple POVs and there are quite a few main characters so I dont think I was given enough time to care about each of them individuall. Now that Im thinking on it, there was really only one character that I even liked. Not saying that I disliked any of the characters, I just didnt care for them. There were times when something would happen to a specific character or to someone they loved and I would literally feel nothing. The connection just wasnt there. Magnus, Lucia, Jonas, Cleo, Aron and Theon are a few of the main characters in this book and theyre what really kept me invested in the story because I wanted to see how all of their paths were going to cross and what was going to happen when they did. Magnus is the characters that I actually liked in this story even though hes kind of a messed up individual. Hes the son of King Gaius who is also known as the king of blood and he resides in Limeros with his sister Lucia. Magnus gives off this indifferent demeanor. He walks around life as if he doesnt care about anything but he does. Its really just a defense mechanism hes had to develop, hone and perfect in order to survive living with his sociopathic and abusive father. Cleo is the princess of Auranos and the daughter of King Corvin. Shes pretty much a brat throughout the entire story and Im only now starting to realize how much she really annoyed me. Shes 16 years old which can explain away some of her behavior but some of the things she does and says just rubbed me the wrong way. I always get what I want no matter what, was one of those things. Jonas is a poor kid living in Palesia. His father is a winemaker and he and his brother have lived their whole lives trying to provide for their family in a kingdom with nothing to offer. Jonas is a revolutionary who wants to see a change and has a grand idea on how to make that happen. Each of these characters interact and meet with one another in some way or another and these meetings arent always pleasant or even wanted. Princes and princesses, lords and peasants all crossing each others paths. And with hate and vengeance simmering just below the surface theres bound to be some blood shed. Im not going to lie, this book wasnt the best and I was quite annoyed while reading it sometimes. There was the instalove that hit me right in the trachea because it literally came out of nowhere. There was the stupid conclusions made by some of the characters that really made no sense given the actions and actual WORDS that were said to them. There was a lot of flip flopping as well. The kingdoms all worship a different goddess or person and for Limeros in particular, magic is looked upon as an evil sin. Yet...when a particular person just blatantly does magic, no one bats an eyelash. It just didnt make sense to me. It didnt add up and I feel like fantasy series are already so complex and there are already so many questions that need to be answered to begin with. Theres no need for there to be MORE confusion and continuity issues added on top of that. Overall this was a pretty solid read. I DID enjoy it even though it was just a tad bit juvenile for my tastes. I am interested in seeing whats going to happen and I will be picking up the next book in the series. Falling Kingdoms did end on a cliffhanger and I feel like if I actually cared about the characters or had some type of connection to them, Id be ordering the next book in the series right now. But because I dont, Im really not in a great rush to pick it up. There are other books I want to read first. Alot of people say that if youre new to the fantasy genre and you want to get your feet wet before you dive into the really complex stuff, Falling Kingdoms is the way to go. But Im going to have to disagree. It is very simple and easy to understand but not in a good way. Juvenile. I would say if you want to get into a fantasy series, start with Graceling or Poison Study or Finnikin of the Rock.
Ive been a fan of Sarah MacLeans brand of romance since I first discovered her work with Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake which remains a favorite. She has set a very high standard with her stories, and while Ive loved some of her books more than others, the key point here is that Ive loved each and every one of them, and the first book in her Rules of Scoundrels series, A Rogue by Any Other Name, is no exception. Penelope Marbury hasnt had luck with love. She was once engaged to a Duke, but that ended badly with him marrying someone else for love, consequently tainting her reputation. Though her heart was not broken along with her engagement, she mourns the loss of the potential for love, companionship and a family of her own. Given a second chance she decides that it will be love or nothing and she refuses to settle for anything less. She wants more out of life...and that idea of more is cleverly and brilliantly prevalent throughout the entire book. She was once very dear childhood friends with Michael, who would eventually inherit the title of the Marquess of Bourne. They had a very special and close connection, until he lost everything as a very young man in a game of cards to his guardian, a person he was supposed to be able to trust and guide him, but instead humiliatingly betrayed him. His destitution left him deeply embarrassed, scarred and desperate to survive by any means necessary to try and one day gain back the life that was stolen from him. Revenge has become his entire existence up until he reunites with his heroine. After many years Michael and Penelope meet again, and while she fondly remembers the boy and friend that he used to be, he has returned to gain her hand in marriage by any means necessary, including her planned ruination in order to win back his beloved home Falconwell; her dowry. During their time apart Michael has become a ruthless man, sometimes even cruel, who will do anything necessary to fulfill his goals. Hes driven by revenge which has consumed him for so long, that he feels he is completely lost and irredeemable. He doesnt like who he has become, in fact he loathes his ruthlessness, but feels that as long as it gets him what he needs to prove his success, that the ends justify the means...at any cost. Including Penelopes love, her esteem and her reputation. Penelope has a hard time reconciling the boy she loved with the man he has become. Thus begins the emotional, and sometimes heartbreaking journey of their love story. Michael is a very interesting hero, in that at first he does not seem to have any redeemable characteristics. Hes completely reprehensible. The author pulls no punches in letting you know that revenge has consumed and blinded Michael to anything other than what he feels he needs to do in order to gain back what was lost, no matter the expense to himself or anyone else. Yet, he also fully comprehends that it comes at a very high cost to his soul and humanity, but that it is a price he is willing to pay. So while he gains back what he has lost in possessions, he will ultimately lose more than what he did in the long ago fateful game of cards. Michael sees no hope for himself, so when Penelope reenters his life, and brings with her the possibility of love instead of revenge, he fights it. Because to lose her again...especially now that his feelings for her are more, would be a loss so devastating that he might not survive it. Some people have hated Michael, and feel that he is not a worthy hero. However, I have to disagree. I loved him as a hero. He actually reminds me a bit of Lisa Kleypass Derek Craven from Dreaming of You, and as hard as it is to believe, I think Michael is even more destitute. Consequently though, it also means that his redemption is even that more satisfying. Each chapter of the book begins with a letter that Penelope has written to Michael, so that the reader can understand their friendship and their deep connection to each other even at such a young age. And as each chapter progresses you feel Penelopes loss of that friendship...from the letters going unanswered after Michael loses everything, to eventually her not even mailing them, but still continuing to write her thoughts to him in a journal. So when they meet again you can understand, despite his cruelty and who he has become, why she doesnt give up on him. Why she is willing to fight for his love and save him from himself. However, she is also not a glutton for punishment. She is given hope, in small but meaningful ways, like when he slips and calls her Sixpence a childhood nickname he gave her when everyone else called her Penny, because to him she was worth more than just a mere penny, or when he hands her his marker, which to him represents the man he used to be...one who has integrity and is honorable...she knows all is not lost. That there is hope, that if she has enough courage for them both, that they can have everything and win at the game of love. I also have to mention that while A Rogue by Any Other Name is maybe not my favorite of this authors works its a close second though, I thought that her writing style in this story was nothing short of brilliant. I dont think Ive ever read a book that used one word, in this case more, that evoked so much meaning and emotion in different ways...hope, pain, regret, bliss. This word is used repeatedly throughout the entire story with different intentions, and while it is such a simple word it conveys very complex emotions with simplicity and elegance. I thought it was just....brilliant! In this book she has also written some of the most emotionally intimate loves scenes that Ive read in quite some time. They were passionate, and poignant and everything that I love in a great romance. Again, brilliant! So if I loved A Rogue by Any Other Name so much, why didnt I give it 5 stars? It was the epilogue...the last parting insight into the characters lives to give you the happily ever after warm fuzzies...had exactly nothing to do with the hero and heroine from this story. Instead it was essentially a preview chapter for the next book in the series. An epilogue is supposed to be a conclusion to a story, not the beginning of a new one...end of story. However, despite the epilogue I absolutely fell in love with A Rogue by Any Other Name. It will most certainly be one of my favorite romances of 2012! Ratings: Overall: 4.95 stars it would have been perfect except for the epilogue...but since the epilogue didnt have anything to do with the hero and heroine from this book I didnt feel right about taking off any more...but I really really wanted an epilogue with Penelope and Bourne! Sensuality level: 3.50 the hero is passionate, but he fights his attraction to the heroine...darn it! A copy of this book was provided to me via the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review, and was reviewed for the Seductive Musings blog.
I.... Im done. And I have NO idea what Im supposed to do now... I dont even know how to feel.... I honestly just want to cry because its over... Wow. This has got to be some of Cassies best work, in my opinion. I dont even know where to begin! Theres just a lot I need to say. I might ramble quite a bit throughout this review, so I ask that you be patient with me and let me ride it out. Im feeling a LOT of things even after having processed my thoughts for two whole days. First of all, let me say. I absolutely LOVED this book. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Of the 100 things I needed this book to do, 99 of them were fulfilled in this conclusion. And I am on my knees in gratitude for Cassandra Clare. No one has rendered my mind, body, and soul to nonfunctioning capacities like she has and I really doubt no one will again. There were so many happy moments, so many sad moments, so many frustratingly annoying moments coughthe CLAVEcough. It was just really well done! Initially, when Cassie released the length of the book page numbers, I was like Oh no, this will either be really bad or really good. Typically when books are that long, there tends to be a lot of filler or moments of lull boredom. Let me tell you, Cassie is talented and skilled enough to keep you on your toes for all 700 pages. There was not a single moment where I didnt find myself emotionally invested in this book. I was on the edge of my seat. Now before I get into my review of plot, I will say  I am a diehard TMI fanatic. I loved it more than TID. I prefer Jace to Will; Alec to Jem; Clary to Tessa. Thats just my clear and honest opinion. BUT I absolutely ENJOYED The Infernal Devices. I just didnt cry buckets over it once it was over. I just appreciated it as being part of the beautiful Shadowhunter world that Cassie created. Now, onto City of Heavenly Fire... It was so good to see my favorite characters, my dream team, back in action. Jace, Clary, Alec, Isabelle, Simon  all of them hold such a dear place in my heart that I cant believe I went without them for so long. Seeing them banter, tease, and just love one another. It was just so heartwarming. The thing that I love about Cassandra Clare is that even in the midst of battle  a HUGE war  she will still find times for her characters to just love one another. To have fun. And thats so beautiful. Its human. THATS where my focus was in this story. How much humanity still remained, even after Sebastian was trying to steal it all? Cassie teased us about how many deaths there would be in the book  she said six. Six named character would die in this book. I counted more than six, but the word named seems to be subjective. But I think I got named confused with main and just assumed that a lot of the main characters would be biting the bullet. So I read this book with intense trepidation. I just couldnt see any of them dying. I was so in love with all of them  Clary, Jace, Alec, Izzy, Simon, Magnus, Jocelyn, Luke, Maia  and many more. I was so scared reading this book. Im not going to talk about scene after scene because I just dont feel that its necessary. If youve read the book, then you know what Im talking about. If you havent, then I havent spoiled much for you. I just want to discuss the handling of the book over all. Sebastian was always an extremely sinister guy, because he was evil. He had demon blood throughout his body, yet he was still a Shadowhunter. The guy was fucked up  for lack of a better phrase. He didnt care who he hurt or killed as long as his ultimate outcome was achieved. Thats some scary crap. Cassie did a fabulous job making my heart drop whenever he appeared in the book. You just never knew what he was capable of. I mean he KILLED Jordan, for goodness sake . Simply to make a point to the Downworlders! Throughout the book, Cassie continues to show us how heartless Sebastian is, but also how flawed he is. His understanding of the human heart and its capacity to love is clearly skewed, which came to light any time he dealt with Clary or Jace  even with Jocelyn, who he claimed to hate. There were small moments where I found myself feeling sorry for him. I pitied Sebastian. All of this anger and hate, yet youre still searching. Thats a very human reaction. I know a few people like that, except not so hellbent on the destruction of people. Clary constantly struggled with her feelings for Jonathan, her brother and Sebastian, her nemesis. Jace struggled with that damned heavenly fire; Simon with his feelings for Izzy and Alec  who was probably one of the biggest highlights of the book for me  with his relationship or lack thereof with Magnus, as well as his personal philosophy of what the Clave represents. Especially with a Daylighter amongst your closest ranks. Izzy still struggled with Maxs death. I never really realized how much she struggled with it. But its definitely understandable considering how it happened. The romantic relationships continued to grow and develop throughout the book, in spite of a HUGE war at their doorsteps. And I loved that. Dont stop living because of war, life still goes on. From Simons drunken love confession to Magnus inability to keep his lips to himself to Jaces propensity to have condoms while in hell  Cassie thought about her fans when writing this book. There were extremely sad moments, extremely painful moments, extremely angry moments, and extremely happy moments. It was honestly the best emotional roller coaster that Ive been on. I got to fall in love with new characters  Julian and Emma  who were SUCH badasses. I loved them. And Im so happy that theyll be taking us into the next Shadowhunter series, The Dark Artifices. The Downworlders from Raphael to Luke to that damn Seelie Queen were so crucial to the fantastic execution of this book. The final chapter and the epilogue were pure perfection for me. As a TMI fan, I got closure. As a TID fan, I got feels. I honestly felt that everything happened for a reason. And I was fine with it. I was happy. I cried when I turned that final page and closed the book, but I was happy. Id say this was an extremely satisfactory ending to a wellloved series. Cassie loves us her readers and she loves her characters. She did us and them justice. You could FEEL that she thought about us as she wrote this book. Was there enough tragedy in this final installment? My answer to that is: Yes. because death is easy; its living thats hard. And to add onto that, surviving a war and living with those scars the loss of a loved one is one of the most tragic and most difficult things to do. That was apparent in this book. The road to recovery is NOT easy. Cassandra Clare, I hear you. I thank you. I love you. You gave me SIX beautiful books NINE, including TID and I will never be able to repay you. I cant wait to be taken on another fantastic journey into the Shadowhunter world. I am humbled. P.S. I would talk about all the feels I got from seeing my favorite TID characters mingling and interacting with my favorite TMI characters, but that would be a little too much feels for me and Ill talk for ages. Just know that it was EPIC and everything I needed it to be! I LOVED it all!
FINAL RATING: 4.25 STARS CATCHALL I have always, always loved the whole Sliding Doors concept, the idea that the two paths of a choice can give you entirely different lives. Wouldnt you want to see where each path would take you? For Addison Coleman, thats her reality. Pivot Point was a gorgeous work of hypotheticals that I fell in love with. With strong characters and an absolutely beautiful and original concept, Pivot Point is certainly a work that is going to stay with me for some time. THE HEROINE ADDIE Addie is our heroine who is constantly torn between her different futures. She tries not to search her choices too much, but it is her ability and sometimes she cant resist. The problem is that sometimes the lines between her choices blur and she has a difficult time remembering which choice was the searched one and which one she actually lived. Shes sensible and smart but shes also prone to listening to her heart, just like any girl. She finds herself torn between two boys and two futures, and sometimes her choices arent all easy, but she still does what she needs to. THE LOVE INTERESTS DUKE Though I love both boys, I have to admit I think I love Duke just a little bit more. He has some serious issues and he doesnt always do the right thing, but I think in the end his heart is in the right place. Hes messed up, but thats a lot of his attraction. I think he really does care about Addie, and hes sweet in his own way. So I do love him, I really do. I think he maybe just needs to grow up a bit. TREVOR Trevor is seriously swoonworthy. Though at the beginning Addie isnt sure if hes going to be just a friend or not, its clear that theres chemistry between them. Hes open about his intentions and doesnt have any darker purposes. Though he was hurt in an accident, hes still in many ways a very ordinary although super hot guy. I absolutely love that he always seems to be in a very goodnatured mood, and hes willing to let almost anything go. Yet he still stands up for himself, and Addie. THE PLOT Originality is quite possibly the number one thing I look for in a book. I like knowing that an author is developing a new concept. While the Sliding Doors concept isnt exactly brandnew, its also not something I can recall seeing in YA. I also love paranormal contemporary, which is what this was. So even after just the first glance, I fell in love. I wasnt disappointed when I read it, either. Addie is a smart heroine who told her story with a reliable voice and is an entertaining but factual account. Its not a sugarcoated story. We get every stunning high and every devastating low, making it a very emotionally charged story, much more of one than I ever expected it to be. Because of this I formed a deep connection to this novel and its characters, all of whom I loved. My main problem with this story is the worldbuilding. It doesnt suck, but its also not spectacular. I didnt get to know Addies world without the compound as much as I wanted to, and I felt a deep disappointment in that. Hopefully well get more of that in the next book, but even so, I felt like there should have been more to it in this one. There was a bit too much mystery behind it, and I didnt like that. Even so, despite this, I still found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable novel. We cant always be sure what is going on. Though some things were predictable, I was still kept guessing enough that I didnt feel cheated. I also liked the way Addie isnt content to just let things sit the way they are. She wants to try and figure things out, even if she cant always see the danger behind the choices she makes. It wasnt a perfect book, but it was fabulous and nothing could keep me from loving it. The plot was executed wonderfully and it was a memorable, fun, and deep read. I really enjoyed it, and its definitely worth the time and easily among my favorite reads of ever. THE ROMANCE There isnt exactly a traditional love triangle in this book. Addie is torn between Duke and Trevor, but in two entirely different lives. Both boys are hot, and both care about her, but she can only choose one of them. Though it isnt entirely about love, that is a major part of it. Trevor is sweet and ordinary, while Duke is popular, a major hotshot. Both are very different, and so are their romances. With Duke, its heated from the beginning and he doesnt hide his interest in her. Trevor starts off as a friend, but that only makes the romance all the more smoldering. THE WRITING Kasies writing is gorgeous. Truly, purely gorgeous. I love the uniqueness and vulnerability in Addies voice. Shes young, but her ability has lent her a type of wisdom that comes through the pages. I love the way the chapters are titled, too. Its clever without being overly precious. Also, I adore the sharpness of the description and the imagery it evokes. Its like Im actually there. I think sometimes the vocabulary gets a bit simple, but its not that big of a deal. THE ENDING The ending was definitely not what I expected, but I mean that in the best way. Neither of Addies choices are ideal, something I didnt expect but loved. In the end, theres only one future that she can accept choosing. I loved that it wasnt simply a happyeverafter. Theres still a huge mess to clean up and a lot that needs fixing but I think that Addie made the right choice, no matter what kind of bad things happened. WRAPUP So yeah, I absolutely adored Pivot Point. It was a touching story of choice and sacrifice, and this is gonna sound so cliche an ordinary girl with extraordinary powers and the ability to see her future. I would definitely recommend it to fans of sweet romances and a love of the paranormal but also to pretty much everyone else. I will certainly be going Kasies fan club and reading her future works in the sequel to this book. FINE. Find more of my reviews on Sparkles and Lightning!
5 Stars! My life is mine. I live it. I control it HOLY SHIT!!! Can somebody just tell me W.T.F. just happened?! Okay, so lets rewind a little. You want a book a book that is the perfect blend of YA and NA with you so much angst that you can literally feel it buzzing in your body? Want to read a book with so much sexual tension that you just want them to just go ahead and do the dirty, already? Love to hate the fade to black sex scenes? Look no further because THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! I have no idea when was the last time a book got me so addicted to it. I had lost all sense of time. I started this book a very slow weekend and a terrible long week of book slump and them BOOM! Hellooo, new favorite! Where were you hiding all this time? I had papers to write but I literally dropped everything to read this and the only time I put the book down was when I could no longer fight to keep my eyes open. This book had the best angst I have read in a very long time and it was absolutely brilliant! The heroine of the book is tough as nails and will, in no way, bow down to anybodys whims and fancies. She is thrust into a family of complete jerks. But dont worry about them.You will like them in no time. Hopefully... Just kidding. Some kids dream of travelling the world, owning fast cars, big houses. Me? I want my own apartment, a fridge full of food and a steady paying job, preferably one that is as exciting as paint drying. Ella Harper has led a tough life. At the age of 17, she never knew her father and the only parent, her mother lost a battle against cancer and is now left all alone in the world where is doing everything possible to make it on her own and just survive. Her determination to succeed stems from a mother who was flighty and moved from boyfriend to boyfriend to support herself and her daughter. Her mother even though flighty was in no way a bad mother. She loved Ella with everything she had. Out of nowhere a man, Callum Royal, ends up at Ellas school claiming to be her legal guardian and takes her home with him where his 5 sons await. You should know whatever game youre playing, you cant win. Not against all of us. If you leave now, you wont be hurt. If you stay, well break you so bad that youll be crawling away. The Royal boys are led by the elder brother, Reed Royal and all 5 of them are brutal! To say they were not happy to see Ella invading their home is the understatement of the century. The Royal rule over everything and their school, which Ella has to now go to, is their Kingdom. A person is nothing until they have received a Royal Decree which would state their future in the school. No one wants to be ruined. We all want to be saved. Ella is one tough cookie. No matter what the Royals throw at her she faces all the obstacles head on. I loved Ellas strength and courage and how she handled them. She is literally the most bad ass heroine I have had the privilege to read about. The tension between Ella and Reed is off the charts. Though both of them harbor an intense dislike towards each other, you can feel the undercurrent that passes around them every time they are around each other. As the novel progresses and Ella gets to know the Royal boys, she finally starts to see them for what they really are. The authors have done an absolutely fantastic job with this book. When you will start reading the book you will HATE the Royal brothers. Reed, the leader of the pack, was the worst but I still loved him Im crazy that way, I guess? but you will, for sure, fall in love with Easton Royal. This guy is everything that Reed is not and he became a friend to Ella when she was in a desperate need for someone in her corner. The book kept me on my toes and all that angst and twists and turns, the highend drama, the love the hate, the friendship, the question of who to trust and who to not AND the mother of all CLIFFANGERS!!! I mean... What? Why would you do that?! How could you even think of such a thing?! I... NO! I can NOT wait until July for the next installment. That is absolutely cruel! That last chapter will have your jaw on the floor and you will and it will break your heart and it will also question your mental state as well as the authors. No kidding! If you want a book that is all consuming and a soul sucking dementor in the best way possible, of course then is it! This book is the one! This book is exactly what the authors described  a love child of Cruel Intentions and Gossip Girl. I cant even begin to describe how apt this is. READ IT!! These Royals will ruin you. Maybe I want to be ruined. BUY Paper Princess Paperback BUY Paper Princess Kindle  You can follow me on: Facebook Page Main Blog Twitter
 spoiler alert  This review can be found on my blog The Rest Is Still Unwritten The Host by Stephenie Meyer is a sensationally written and beguiling book. Its complicated and intricate storyline will captivate and its tangible characters will beckon as readers become lost in its emotional depth and romantic beauty. This is one story that is sure to stay with you long after youve turned the final page! Having literally just finished this book Im in all honesty not sure I have the words to encompass how I really feel about The Host. Nothing I can say will do justice to how much I love this bookIm just a mass of jumbled emotions right now and still find myself very much lost within the story. Have you ever waited a long time after a book is released to actually read it, only to find yourself wondering why in the world it took you so long to pick it up in the first place? Thats how I feel about The Host. Despite the fact that Stephenie Meyers Twilight series kick started my love of reading after my tween years, its taken me more than 5 years after The Hosts release to actually read this book. And now for the life of me I cant figure out why! This book is phenomenal! Honestly. Say what you what about Stephenie Meyeryou either love her or hate herbut as far as Im concerned The Host proves in my mind once and for all that Stephenie Meyer can write. That she is without a doubt a talented authorwhat shes created with The Host is nothing short of amazing! Launching into a thrilling story from almost the opening page, Meyer introduces us to a world where human society we have always known it is nonexistent. Earth has been taken over by an alien life form that takes possession of their hosts bodies and who now inhabit the bodies of almost everyone on earth. Normal humans are almost extinct, with these alien souls now controlling the worlds population. Brimming with danger, angst and romance, Meyer explores the complexity of the human spirit and what it means to be human in The Host. One of the things I think I was so surprised about this book was its unexpected depth. Stehpenie Meyer really does delve into what it means to be human and what it means to love in this well written and detailed story. Spanning more than 600 pages, I found so much unexpected beauty and emotion within its pages. The concept in this book is thrilling; I really like how Meyer explored so much human emotion and managed to have me completely besotted with an alien life forma life form that really should be the enemy! The Host follows Wanderer, an invading soul whose life is forever changed when her host Melanie refuses to relinquish possession of her mind and body without a fight. Though Wanderer thinks she is happy as she is, she cannot ignore the yearning she feels as Melanie bombards her constantly with thoughts and memories of the people she left behind; people who are still hiding. As Melanies feelings slowly become her own, and the danger to these people both she and Melanie love, Wanderer has no choice but to follow her heart as she begins her journey to find them. Personally, I think Wanda is quite possibly one of the best characters Ive ever seen written. I ADORE this girl, I really do. Wanda is, simply put, a beautiful soul. As our main character and heroine, Wanda is beyond amazing to follow. Meyer writes her so well that you cant help but come to adore this selfsacrificing and loving individual. I think the biggest difference between The Host and other scifi books where aliens have invaded and have taken possession of the human face, for me, is that we witness The Host unfolding though the eyes of one of these life forms. Wanda is just a good person, and as she struggles to reconcile what she is and what her species has done, and will continue to do, with the love and friendships she builds whist living in Melanies body, Wandas ability to care, and care deeply, is something that will continue to steal your heart as the book unfolds. All the characters in this book were brilliantespecially all the humans Wanda comes to see as her family. Each was tangible and real; full of life, each with different personalities, flaws and insecurities. Ian, Jamie, Jared, Jeb, Melanie.....I adored them all so much! Sometimes when reading this book I found myself almost as in love with Ian as what Wanda was. Ian was such a fantastic character; honorable, kind and true....able to see Wanda for who she was not whose body she was wearing. Every little kindness he did for her and the fierce way he came to love her just won me over; his patience and understanding were such balms to the harsher aspects of the novel. I loved the intense way Wanda experienced emotions and the way in which Meyer explored this through her very different relationships with other characters. The complexity regarding Wandas feelings for Jared having experienced Mels memories and her love for Jamie was intriguing things to witness; beautiful even. Admittedly, it was odd at times seeing her unable to distinguish her feelings for Jared from Mels, but I thought it was different to see explored in a book. I LOVED the strong and endearing relationship and love Wanda experienced with Ianthats a givenbut I thought it was a stunning touch to the story for Stephenie Meyer to have both Wanda and Mel bond as they did. They went from being enemys to allies, then to friends and sisters. Theirs was a beautiful relationship. The Host is undoubtedly action and science fiction based, but the elements of love and friendship that I found bursting from its pages were spectacular. The Host is superbly written and perfectly explored. Romantic, riveting and addictive, The Host is simply unforgettable!
I love this book so much. It is currently 2:18 AM in my neck of the woods so I will have a review up tomorrow. But for right now all you need to know is this book is amazing and YOU NEED TO READ IT. Minor Spoilers Ahead The presence of gold fades with distance, but never leaves me. Maybe, in California, it will infuse me constantly, like the warmth of my own private sun. This is the first book Ive read by Rae Carson and it certainly will not be the last. I loved her writing and the characters she created. She did not hold back in this book when it came the history and the events that occurred within the story. Life, death, violence, anger, HISTORY, all of these things came together to create a truly magnificent story. This nugget is nothing, Lee. Even your magic is nothing. Youre a good girl and the best daughter. And that? Thats something. Yes, Daddy. The story is told in the perspective of our buttkicking heroine, Leah Westfall. We first meet Leah in the woods of Dahlonega, Georgia in January of 1849. The MexicanAmerican War has just ended a year earlier and one of the results of this was President James K. Polk acquiring the California territory. This would forever change the United States as well as Leah Westfalls life. Leahs parents are tragically murdered in the beginning of the story. After this event Leahs Uncle Hiram comes into the picture. He intends to take over Leahs home and life, and Leah sees that the freedom she experienced with her parents is quickly being taken away. The only way she can truly be free is if she heads west to find her best friend Jefferson and escape into California where her Uncle Hiram has no power over her. So Leah disguises herself as a boy and she starts on a journey that will be extremely tough but also fulfilling in Leahs search for herself. So its now, with my own fire crackling, my lips greasy with the squirrel I just ate, and the night echoing with the distant yip of a coyote that I miss Daddy most. He should be here with me. We should have been on this adventure together. One part that really struck me was when Leah was travelling alone in the beginning of the novel. She is such a strong character and person but the reader still must remember that she is still grieving for both her parents and the life she had before. Rae Carson made Leahs emotions so real and her grief actually made me emotional. A lot of this book made me emotional actually. However, we see Leah eventually find Jefferson and find people that she comes to care for and care for her. Trust someone, Mama said. Her dying words, burned into my heart. But she was wrong. When theres gold to be had, you cant trust anyone. Not a single soul. Leah has a secret power. She can sense gold, whether its in the Earth or its a necklace around someones neck. It is a dangerous ability for any person to have because of the lust for gold during the California Gold Rush. This lust is partly what drove her Uncle to murder her parents and she knows she has to keep this a secret from everyone, including her best friend Jefferson. Although Leah begins the story unwilling to trust anyone, she learns along the way that there are people she can trust. Her growth throughout the novel is shown in her interactions with Jefferson and the other families that she travels with to California. I loved the entire journey that Leah was on. It brought me back to my Oregon Trail days. I was OBSESSED with that game when I was little kid. My mom allowed me to play on our dinosaur of a computer for only an hour a day and Oregon Trail was my go to game. Rae Carson made me feel like I was there on the trail with Leah. It was so realistic and actually really historically accurate. I am a history major and Ive learned my fair share of American history. Its never been my favorite history to learn about but Ive always loved learning about this era with the California Gold Rush and the move west. The scene that really killed me was the buffalo scene because that kind of thing actually happened. The measles blankets also really made me angry, because again its something that people actually did. Rae Carson does an amazing job of including real history in this story and it was such a breath of fresh air. Seems like Ive been waiting for you to come around my whole life, Lee. But a man cant wait forever and stay a man. I just want to say a few things about the relationship between Leah and Jefferson. First of all, I loved their relationship. They have been best friends forever but now that theyre older it seems like it could be more. Rae Carson made their relationship develop very slowly and that was so great. We hardly have any romance in this novel, its not the main focus and thats what helps make this novel great. I totally thought Jefferson and Therese were going to have something and I was going to get annoyed but thats not the case. I cant wait to see where this relationship goes. Theres not a place in the whole world where everyone isnt willingno, eagerto give up a girl to a man. Can we talk about the feminist undertones in this book? Obviously, we can talk about Leah and her independence but we can also really analyze Becky Joyner as well. I even like Mrs. Joyner now! She was a youknowwhat in the beginning but she really grew on me. Her unpleasantness stems from her husband, in my opinion. And once he dies I think she is able to find that independence that all women in their lives want. Leahs transformation is really at the forefront of the novel but as a reader I also loved watching Beckys transformation as well. She is a mother who cares only for her children and she does everything in her power to protect them even if that means to be rude and harsh to people like Leah. However, over the course of this journey Becky Joyner learns more about being a woman and that theres more to life than being a wife. This book is one of the only books where I havent been annoyed with a single character. Yeah I didnt like some of the bad guys but they all worked in the story and I enjoy reading about them. I just really cant wait to read the next book. I love all of these characters and their relationships with one another. I would recommend it to everyone, especially if you love American history and are in the mood for a journey because this book really takes you on one. I feel like Ive written an essay but this book has really had an impact on me. My only regret is that I wish I read it sooner! Ive never felt so far from Gods grace. I suppose I am a stranger walking on Earth, but Im no son of God. Im no son at all. Happy reading, friends! You can also find this review on my blog here: 
I harboured deep skepticism with regards to this book. I wanted to read it only because it was highly recommended by one of my favourite writers of one of my favourite T.V. shows. However, as you must already know from my previous reviews that is you have read some of my earlier reviews recommendations dont really work for me and so I opened this book with trepidation and zero expectations. At that time, I was also lamenting the fact that I had bought this book in its hard cover first edition with the authors signature and I was wondering as to why I would ever do that and if this book would ever be worth all that! Im a great fan of paperbacks However, I was pleasantly surprised to notice that I was actually enjoying reading this book when I started out and then by the end or very near it, I was very nearly sobbing. Yes, the book moved me, it is extremely poignant and gut  wrenching to say the least but just because it is a sad book and makes us cry, is it supposed to be necessarily a good book? This question came to mind whilst reading it. Ordinarily, we come to love a book if it makes us cry and makes us feel very deeply about things but I think a great book is one which makes us feel and think as well, both. And that is precisely why I have given this book five stars  Im usually very meager with them , this book made me feel  cry, laugh etc. and also made me think on a deeper level about things, which I will elucidate for you in just a minute. The first question that comes to mind is that why cancer? Why has the author chosen such a difficult and painful subject? Is it because he thought that a book on cancer would garner a lot of readers and many people would like the book because you know it would be sad and heartbreaking? Why do we as readers read such sad books and why do people write them? I guess the answer is some of the above and some of what my next line will reveal to you. It is important to write such books, books about people suffering and battling diseases because that is a part of human existence and experience. The question also is that why do we only like or read books about healthy, heroic people? Are these people not heroic who suffer from such life threatening diseases? Whose every day is a battle? So, I would say that Green does well by writing about a condition that no one wants to really write about. Sure there are stories of people, articles, research and medical journals about the subject but seldom do writers venture out on such an unlikely territory such as basing a book around cancer. Also, Green should be commended on the fact that with such a difficult subject like cancer, he truly does wonders. He does not make his novel in to a sad, soppy , sugary saga as he could have instead he turns it around and makes it in to this bittersweet, life  affirming novel about being brave and remembering that the little things are more important than the big things. Green is a brilliant writer; I will certainly give him that. He has his unique voice which is confident and strong. He shows us how heartbreak and pain can have an antidote in humour. Everything is easier to handle or just a little easier to bear when humour is with us and within us. The narrative tone of the novel is funny, ironic, sarcastic all rolled in to one and this is why this novel works. Green does not preach from a morally high pedestal, he merely shows us the potential of human beings to brave anything and to be the best they can be with humour on their side. I am so glad that Green is writing for the Young Adult genre as youngsters and teenagers needs to read such novels to understand not only the power of humour etc. but also the power of literature. Green by creating this world of art, literature, poetry and books in this novel shows us how literature has immense power, the power to heal in the case of Hazel and Augustus or to destroy as in the case of Van Houten. Green not only uses his intelligence and gifted powers of storytelling to write this novel but also writes with a lot of heart and which is why it tugs at the readers heartstrings. This is a very honest book, if you know what I mean. It is as others have called it very raw and therein lies its appeal. He does not sugarcoat things for his readers and give it to them as it is and that is why it becomes so powerful and compelling at the same time. I must add though for all its excellence and brilliance the novel did seem a little formulaic to me. The formula that came to mind was  two star crossed young lovers afflicted with cancer, fall in love, have an idyllic utopian and paradisiacal time before tragedy strikes with a twist and more tears and heartbreak follows, followed by something lifeaffirming and redeeming at the end of the novel. The major twist that I have mentioned in the previous line is one that I had already anticipated halfway through the novel so I guess there were lesser waterworks and lesser gasps of surprise as compared to other readers who probably might not guess it. It does not really matter that much though as this is not a crime thriller wherein one needs to know the murderer. What I am trying to convey is that basically because it came across as a formula to me, I think I found myself a little detached from the novel as well as the characters. I was not heartbroken as I should would have been. I mean the novel is designed in a certain fashion to elicit tears, which had the reverse psychological effect on me. That is perhaps why I wasnt as moved as others perhaps might have been. One may argue and say well that all novels are formulaic. One might perhaps be right in that but not in its entirety. I think mostly crime novels or thrillers are formulaic, though of course this contention of mine remains debatable. Having pointed this out, I must add that I have still given the novel five stars simply because it is a novel which does a lot of interesting things and tackles a lot of important themes. It brings on to the table the important questions that we all ask ourselves at some point or the other  will we be remembered? Have we been heroic enough? Have we left an indelible mark in this world? Are we deeply and truly loved? These are such important questions to us humans and these questions existential or not have been deftly discussed and explored in the novel. The novel also talks about the power of Literature as I previously discussed and the power of human emotions like love and compassion. It is a beautiful love story no doubt and the character of Augustus Waters will remain in our memory for the longest of times, this is how men should be  I think  , along with Alexander Belov The Bronze Horseman. Even though I was not able to completely identify with the characters or be completely in the book if you know what I mean, I will still say go ahead and read it. This is a brave novel about brave heroes. As Green puts it You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice: And most importantly this book makes us realize that Some infinities are bigger than other infinites. I am no longer complaining about the hard cover first edition and I will do a re think about recommendations from now on. Thank you, John Green.
Reviewed by Willow  Donna  5 Stars I think the fact that I misjudged him pisses me off more than the fact that he cheated on me. If I cant even accurately judge the people closest to me, then I cant trust anyone. Ever. I hate them from taking that away from me. Now, no matter who comes into my life after this, Ill always be skeptical. Donna: Well what can I say, can Colleen write a bad book? Well the answer is a big fat resounding no!! I totally and utterly adored this book. It made me happy and sad, made me cry buckets but it took me on an amazing emotional journey that I will not forget in a hurry and made my mascara run and run and run. Willow: I will admit that this book had the ice queen melting  yes it did have me crying quite alot too. Colleen is an amazing writer, it is so effortless reading her words and she really makes you feel every single one. Ridge has been trying to write songs for his brother and their band, but is having writers block. Seeing Sydney from across the court yard connecting to his music and creating lyrics for them, Ridge realises he needs her help. With the betrayal Sydney has just faced, she now has no home and no job. Ridge comes up with a solution that helps Sydney and gets her helping him write the songs that he needs. With this book you get the added bonus of the free soundtrack. I think that having the music linked to Colleens and Griffins written words adds a whole new level to the book, whilst I didnt listen to all the sound track whilst reading, I can certainly see that adds so much more of an experience to the book. Donna: Yes music and words always go hand in hand and in the book it was the way in which Sydney and Ridge communicated the most honestly. It was during these interactions that Colleen had my heart melting. It was beautiful to read and I always felt as if I was there watching them make beautiful music together that is literally, get your minds outta the gutter lol! Willow: lol! The sessions where they were writing together really felt intimate and I felt like I was intruding on these beautiful moments.The book isnt all hearts and flowers though, there is cheating in this book and a lot of heart ache too, and these were the moments that really had me crying. I could feel the pain emanating off the pages! Donna: Ridge does have a long term girlfriend called Maggie. I wouldnt have said it was cheating between Sydney and Ridge though, they had a stolen kiss but stopped it going further. You really felt his inner turmoil surrounding his feelings regarding Maggie and what he felt for her. I couldnt help but be affected and as I said before was living through the angst with him. As much as I wanted Sydney and Ridge to be together I understood his relationship with Maggie and didnt want anything bad to happen either. I really was in a catch22 situation. Ridge with Maggie: I spend the next half an hour reminding myself how much Ive missed her. I remind myself how much I love her. I remind myself how good it feels when were together. I keep reminding myself over and over, because for the past week, it felt as if I was starting to forget. Willow: The situation Sydney and Ridge were in was a difficult one. They obviously were developing feelings for one another and this was clearly shown through their music, but Ridge clearly loves Maggie, and thats the difficulty for the reader, Maggie is not some bitch girlfriend, she is a nice girl, that as much as you try, you cant help but like too! I did really feel for her, and wondered how would she feel if she found out what whats happening between Sydney  Ridge, no matter how much Ridge was trying to hold back and respect Maggies feelings. I was totally torn though, wishing that Sydney would get her Maybe Someday with Ridge. Im also thankful that she appears to have more will power than I do, because whenever Im around her, Ive never felt so weak. Donna: I was the same, I really felt the pain, anguish, conflict and turmoil. I did feel that there was something hidden with his relationship with Maggie and was glad when we did eventually get more of the back story as that did help somewhat in trying to get my head around the situation. Maggie was an extremely strong woman, despite what life had thrown at her and was glad that when all was said and done she could be objective and see the bigger picture Willow: The fact that Colleen wrote Maggie as a beautiful, nice, kindhearted girl packs much more of a punch in my opinion. The reader cannot find fault with her, cannot find a reason to blame her or justify why Ridge would develop feelings for someone else. As much as I would like it to be true, I personally dont believe that there is just one person, one soul mate for you. I believe that you may have more than one love through out your life, maybe this love will change as you grow as a person, or are faced with different situations, but that does not diminish the love you felt before or for someone else and I think that is it great that this book reflects that. Donna: I totally agree, I believe that the love he felt for Maggie was totally different than the love he felt for Sydney. Whilst both all encompassing and he struggled, I am like you and believe that you can get that chance to love more than one. It just sucked that they both came along at the same time but the sweet was that it a it was present in the first place and b I think it all worked out perfectly in the end, despite everything. For her I bend, for you I break. I have to say that I also loved Warren, Ridges flat mate, he deserves a book too! Willow: Yes Warren added a brilliant bit of humour to the book. He was looking out for Ridge, Sydney  Maggie all together trying to ensure that no one was left with too much pain. Will Ridge  Sydney get their Maybe Someday? There isnt a doubt in my mind that we could be perfect for each others life, Sydney. Its that our lives arent perfect for us We will leave you to find out but we cant go without mentioning that there is a twist to this story, but it is a spoiler so we cant say what, but if what we have already said isnt enough for you, this twist totally adds to the whole story. Donna: Yes, there is a definite twist, not one that I have encountered before and it made this book so much more! I cant wait for everyone to read it and savour, live and breathe every single word. This is not a book to be skimmed. It should be read slowly, savoured and devoured! You wont be disappointed, it truly is a work of art. It is my tied number one read so far this year! Willow: A totally beautiful book! Beat, beat, pause. Beat, beat, pause. Beat, beat, pause. Its absolutely beautiful. The way it sounds is beautiful. The way it cares is beautiful. The way it loves is beautiful. He presses his lips to the top of my head. I close my eyes...and I cry.
For more reviews and giveaways, go to  This is far too accurate! This review is, I truly believe, the hardest review I have had to write on the blog so far. How do I even begin to express all my feelings about this book? This is where I know that whatever I say will in no way truly explain the amazing, the exceptional, the heartbreaking thing that is We Were Liars. I just dont have the writing talent that Lockhart does, Im not going to be able to do her book any justice in this review. But I am certainly going to try and I am going to hope that it leads you to pick up this book and experience it for yourself. The summary of the book is one of the greatest I have seen in a long while. Its very intriguing and it piqued my interest straight away. Then I saw all the love pouring in for this book and I knew I had to hurry up and get to me eARC of it. That one line: And if anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.  that is beyond accurate because this has an end that you just dont want to spoil for anyone. I didnt know what to expect from We Were Liars, but it delivered everything I could have wanted and so much more. It earned a place among my favourites, a place among the list of books that has made me sob and became the first book to ever make me cry whilst reading on my lunch break at work. This was ugly crying, this was the kind of crying that made me 5 minutes late back from my break because I had to get my crying under control. I didnt know what to expect from We Were Liars, but I honestly didnt expect that. This packed a definite punch, it was gutwrenching and heartbreaking and I hated it but couldnt stop myself from loving it. Our narrator is Cadence Sinclair Eastman, the first grandchild of Harris and Tipper Sinclair, and heiress to the Sinclair family fortune. The Sinclair family are old money, they own their own private island and I might just be completely in love with them. They provide everything you need in a book; intrigue, love, mystery, drama and everything in between. Cadence looks back on her summers on Beechwood Island, which she spends with her family, including the Liars. The Liars consist of Cady, her cousins, Johnny and Mirren, and Gat, the nephew of her aunts boyfriend. And I enjoyed every second of getting to know them all and finding out about their summers on the island. Cady was a brilliant narrator for me because I couldnt trust her. This book is about discovering what happened during summer 15. This is where Cady suffered a traumatic head injury and washed up on the beach, where she was discovered by her mother. She has no recollection of what happened, why she was swimming in the sea in nothing but her underwear, or why her family refuse to talk to her about it. After she misses summer 16 on the island, Cady is determined to go back this summer, summer 17, and find out what happened to her that year. The mystery aspect of this book was perfection. You were as completely out of the loop as Cady was, you feel as completely lost as she does and it makes it so easy to sympathise with her. Her family arent telling her the whole truth and shes suffering daily pain that makes her almost wish she were dead. All she wants to do is uncover the truth and find out what happened that summer. I was just as desperate to find out as she was because I knew it was going to be something big. Cady and Gats relationship develops slowly as they spend their summers together on the island. I thought Gat was a hilarious character, but a very complex one as well. He spends his summers with them but doesnt feel an accepted part of the Sinclair family. Cadys grandfather does not accept him, or the fact that he and his uncle are both Indian and this bigotry begins to have a big impact on Gat as he gets older. He was hurting and he was an easy character to feel for, I really felt for him and the fact that no one else seemed to notice the treatment he was receiving. I loved and laughed at his hilarious one liners and moments like this, which he writes in a note to Cady: Someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments. I get the same thing spending an hour with you. Also, here is a green toothbrush tied in a ribbon. It expresses my feelings inadequately. Sweet and funny, how could I not just fall in love with that boy? Lockharts writing was exceptional and its made me ache to get my hands on more of her books. She writes in such a beautiful way, her writing was something I had to get used to. I had a moment of reading where I stopped and put the book down because of how shocked I was about what had just happened. After a second of collecting myself, I picked the book up again and realised what I had read was a metaphor and Id had a heartstopping moment over nothing. This occurred a lot for me in the book, but soon you get used to it and I loved this style of writing. I honestly couldnt put the book down, I could read this book on repeat for a week and be just as in love with it. Me after the big reveal. I didnt see it coming, I just didnt. I had no idea what I was expecting to be the big reveal about summer fifteen, but I was ill prepared for the truth. It was heartwrenching but exquisitely done. I wanted to start back at the beginning of the book and look for any hint or clue about what was to come. I still do, its only the fact I am behind on my ARCs that has stopped me doing just that. I loved this book and hated it for what it did to me. Its been a long time since a book made me cry out in utter shock, but this did it. I cried like a child whilst on my lunch at work, and I had to go back late because I needed to collect myself. Was it the end I wanted? Hell no. Was it utterly amazing and exceptional in every way? Hell yes! Look at that, Ive wrote an essay length review of this book and been absolutely unable to express how I feel. I have been unable to show how truly amazing I found every minute of this book. Ive been unable to put across my absolute heartbreak from the moment this book utterly crushed me and made me sob like a baby at work. I havent even covered everything I wanted to cover, need to cover and thats just because I cant. As hard as I try, I honestly cant seem to put into words every little thing I love about this book. 55 Butterflies More like 5 Butterflies. I adored this book, hated what it did to me and loved it regardless. My interest never waned and I fell in love with Lockharts writing style. This is one of the best books I have read and I know I will be reading it again. This book and the reading experience will stay with me for a long time, this is a book I will be forcing upon others and begging them to read. The mystery aspect was perfect, I saw nothing coming and I loved how in the dark I was to what was going to happen. I am in awe of Lockharts story, her talent, her writing. I know I have done this book no justice, but I beg you to give it a go and experience it for yourself.
Every morning I wake up and tell myself this: Its just one day, one twentyfourhour period to get yourself through. I dont know when exactly I started giving myself this daily pep talkor why. But still, I find the need to remind myself of the temporariness of a day, to assure myself that I got through yesterday, Ill get through today. Have you ever read a book thinking Do I really want to read this? Is it really going to be a good book or a waste of time? Well I have a time or two. But when you finish a book have you ever thought God, that was the best book Ive ever read!!! Why did I wait so long to read it? Again, I have a time or two. Let me just say, O.M.G.thats how I felt about this book after the last page was turned. The sequel to If I Stay by Gayle Forman, lies Where She Went an incredible not really needed sequel to the much anticiapted New York Times Best Seller. And just like the first one, I finished it in 24 hours of starting the bookright after I laid If I Stay on the table. I couldnt wait. I can not tell you how I managed to read it through blurry eyes, because this one was so much more emotional. I cried through the whole thing. SPOILERSIf you havent read If I Stay yet, dont read this review. Lets get started..... Its been three years since Mia lost her family in the tragic accident that almost claimed her own life. But this time, the story is told from Adams perspective. Which I think is why I love this book so much more than the first. I love stories told from the guys perspective. After the release of Mia waking up, she has recovered well and pretty quickly. Adam by her side the entire time. She decides to go to Julliard afterall. Once she leaves Adam in Oregon at the air port to go to New York, she never returns. They keep in contact for a few months maybe then after no contact at allhe soon realizes its over. Without so much as a warning from her or explanation, in which she ignores his calls, texts, emails. Eventually, he gives up. He soon falls into a deep depression. Quitting the band and moving back to his parents house, he sinks even deeper. Until Kim, Mias best friend stops by for a visit from her life in New York as well. And only then does the anger set it. Kicking her out he starts writing songs again with more resentment, power, angst, hatred and lovehis band is back together in no time and at the top of the charts with a 1 album and awards for Best New Artist and album. His career takes off again so quickly. But it doesnt fill the void. None of it does. Not even his smokin hot new celebrity girlfriend. None of it matterswithout Mia. As hes getting ready to tour London, he stops in New York for interviews and re record a single to be re released for the album. Instead of heading on a plane with his band to London, he reschedules his flight for the following day. He needs a break from the spotlight for a night. So he goes into the city where he stumbles upon a poster with Mias picture showing she is performing at the Carnegie Hall for a concert that night. Coincidence? I think fate. But who knows. Before talking himself out of it, hes buying a ticket to watch. Afterall, he always loved watching her playits what brought them together in the first place. Before he leaves, he is approached by an usher telling him Mia wants to see him in her dressing room. When she sees him, she is surprised to see that its really him in NY after all this time. When they decide to explore the city that never sleepswhich they never do either being out til 7 am or later, alot happens. Questions get answered, hearts get broken yet again. But most of all, we find out the most important question: Why did she leave him? Wow, Im reliving it all over again. This was a powerful continuation of If I Stay. And to be honest, it didnt need a sequel. The first one was perfect. So I thought. Gayle Forman once again captivated me from the start. With her beautiful words. I cried again the whole way through. At one point, I had to stop, wash my eyes out and take a deep breath only to do it all over again. I didnt think I would get through it. I was sobbing out loud, a little embarrassing. The thing is, I loved hearing Adams story. It moved me in ways I never thought possible. I got to see his vulnerable, emotional side and I loved it. Not that I liked him being in pain, but guys are always so macho when it comes to feelings and such. They think that if we see them cry, we think they are weak. So. Not. True. Its so sweet. And especially after being dumped by your girlfriend who you stood by for 3 years and through so much pain and turmoil, only to have your heartbroken and left to pick up the pieces. Of course he should cry. Why hold it in? He lost his second family that night too and then her shortly after, so she wasnt the only one going through this. She made me so darn mad. But I liked how he alternated every chapter between the past and the present. So we got a view of his experiences with their early blossom of love and family and of course their problems they faced. I laughed and cried and just smiled at the reminiscences. It still hurt me that her family was gone. I felt I really knew them just by Mia and Adams rehashing of the past. And they sounded like awesome parents. But still poor Teddy. That got me the most. But as they relived the past more and more and took a look at the future, you realize their love for each other never died. They took me on an incredible journey of so much emotion and passionI was a bystander watching it in person. I will never forget Mia and Adam. They will always hold a special place in my heart where I will always come back to them to relive their lives all over again. As Im writing this review, I am retelling myself the story as I have it all memorized. Tears welling up in my eyes all over again like I just turned the last page for the very first time. Now I ask, are you gonna read this book? Obviously you will have to read If I Stay first. But you wont regret you did. Because while most sequels lack the ability to keep your attention as much as the first, I swear this one is so different in the way that its by far better. So do they get their happy ending or let each other go? The answer is.......pffffft, Im not telling. Go buy it and find out. I promise youll devour them. Always.
Finally! I read this book and I am almost caught up with this series! I did finish the series but there is a nouvella collection that I NEED to read! I have been putting this book off for so long, I kept avoiding it because I just didnt want to finish the series. I just didnt want to say goodbye to the characters. But in the end, it was worth it, every single thing that happened in this book was so great. The last book in a series is the hardest to write but Marissa Meyer did an amazing job. She gave the readers exactly what we wanted and she handled everything so well! Yeah, but broken isnt the same as unfixable. If you havent heard of this series, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?! This series is called the Lunar Chronicles. The first book is Cinder, followed by Scarlet, then Cress and finally Winter. The book Cinder starts off in New Beijing where the plague is spreading. Cinder is a cyborg who works as a mechanic. She lives with her stepmother and two stepsisters. After fixing something for the young Prince Kai, she is suddenly pulled into the craziest adventure. Discovering more about her familys past, Cinder begins to figure out who she really is. Did you see any rice in there? Maybe we could fill Cinders head with it. This book was everything that I needed. It had everything that I wanted, all of my favourite characters, it had my favourite otps, and it had so much adventure. There was so much going on that I couldnt stop at a page because I wanted to know what happened next! I didnt pick this up for 6 days but yesterday, I somehow convinced myself to start reading and all of a sudden I am finished and I started writing this review! She was prettier than a bouquet of roses and crazier than a headless chicken. Fitting in was not an option. This book had all of my favourite characters. If I HAD to pick a favourite character out of all of them, it would have to be Thorne, he is just so funny and different. Him and Cress are just so cute, I love them both! Thorne kinda reminds me of Flynn Rider from Tangled. My favourite animated character in Disney is Flynn Rider. Cress was different and I loved how shy she was. She reminds me of how I react to different things. Scarlet was great but she wasnt in my top favourite characters. I still think she is awesome but she isnt up there with Cress and Thorne. Cinder is amazing, she is so brave, I just love her! Kai is strong and supportive as well, he is so helpful and would make a great friend. Iko was awesome, she made me laugh so much! Wolf was great but he can be super scary at times. Jacin was great, I understand why he had to act the way he was. Winter was so crazy I loved her, she is so optimistic! What did you bring me today? Delusional mutterings with a side of crazy? The bonds between these characters was another strong point that made me love this book. Kai and Thorne had a little bonding moment. Thorne and Cinder were so sassy with each other it was hilarious, and I loved how they had each others backs. Kai and Cress was another great bond, I love how Cress empathizes with others. Cress thought about Wolf and knew what he was thinking which was great. Winter made awesome friends with Scarlet and I loved how they were together. Jacin and Cress were also awesome but didnt have as much of a bond compared to the others. But it was still a little strong. I loved how connected all of the characters were to each other, I felt so happy with everything! See that eye roll? It translates to, How am I possibly keeping my hands off of you, Captain? The character development was so well done, there were so many differences from when we first saw the characters until now. All of the characters have gotten stronger, they have gotten more used to each others presence and learned to trust each other. They all have a connection and make a great team! Cinder has gotten much, much stronger compared to her old self. Scarlet has also become more independent, along with Wolf. I dont know much about Jacin and Winters character development because we dont see them in the beginning of the series but they were awesome anyway. It seems that they have changed in a few ways though. Thorne has gotten much more stronger and is willing to make himself better for his future and for the ones he loves. : Cress has gotten out of her little bubble and is more interactive with others! Iko did an amazing job in this book as well! They make an awesome squad and it would be awesome to read more about their adventures in the future. Epic Squad! She definitely has a crush on you. Its about the size of Jupiter. All of the romantic relationships in this book were awesome! My favourite is Cresswell! Wolf and Scarlet are alright, but I love Cress and Thorne! And Cinder and Kai feel are swoonworthy too! Winter and Jacin are so cute! I loved all their tiny little moments together, I just wanted to get it out there that I love Cresswell! If you already read the book, who is your favourite ship? All the couples were so cute! One should never save cake for later when it can be eaten now. One of the other strong points that made me love this book was the writing. This book was told in the povs of almost every character. And the writing for each character was different and it was perfect. I could distinguish between the different povs which was great, it makes the characters more realistic. It also showed how each of the characters felt about each other and how they supported each other. Tapping a finger against the flesh of her elbow, she deadpanned, Jacin Clay, there is an assassin under my bed. The pacing of the book was perfect, there was the right amount of romance and action. I didnt feel like this book had any slow moments to be honest. Others may disagree but I felt like this book started off with craziness which kept me reading til the very end. I knew that one of the endings had to happen in order for the series to end but there were so many shocking moments where I would gasp. I still cant believe I am finished this series, I enjoyed it immensely and cannot wait to read The Stars About! If you havent read this series yet, I highly recommend it, it is so different and unique! You are missing out on a lot of different characters that you will grow to love. If you have read the series and are hesitating to pick it up, I understand how you feel! But you should read this because you are missing out! Trust me, it is worth it!
GUS Bright Side, 2 by Kim Holden 5 stars!! Grief. Anger. Grief. Anger. Grief...Anger. After you have read something as perfect as Bright Side you are always going to be nervous reading the sequel, I mean, how can something so perfect ever be matched or even topped? Well, I neednt have worried at all. As soon as GUS landed on my kindle I was all in from the first to last word. Kim Holden does Gus proud in this book and she has given us a story that was honest, real, emotional, intense and so heartbreakingly genuine that you just fell in love with these characters all over again. Kim Holden has once again touched my heart, I felt it all, the grief, the desolation, the turn around, that eureka moment and all the happy that follows. This book was perfectly balanced and I was so thankful that it rang true to life, losing someone that you are extremely close too is not something that you get over easily and it was never brushed aside, it was raw, but it was perfect. Gus as you could imagine really struggles in the beginning and this is where I felt Kim Holden really hit her stride. As I said above, I felt his pain, I felt his emotions, and I felt his devastation. Gus really struggles to find himself. Bright Side was his other half, his soul mate, how could someone possibly go on when one half of them is missing? I have to say I was really worried about Gus, I knew that this was going to hit him hard, but to see how vulnerable and broken he was, was soul crushing at times. I always knew that he would have to hit rock bottom before he could start his painful clamour to the surface and the way this book was written made that journey all the more honest, genuine and unequivocally believable. Bright Side wasnt only my best friend; she was like my other half...the other half of my brain, the other half of my conscience, the other half of my sense of humour, the other half of my creativity, the other half of my heart. How do you go back to doing what you did before, when half of you is gone forever. Gus in the beginning was a shell of the man that we loved and knew, he couldnt write, he couldnt play, he just existed and even then that was up for debate at times. I wanted him to watch the DVD, I wanted him to see what and who he had become, Bright Side wouldnt have wanted this, he needed to know, he needed to be told but he just wouldnt listen. He needed to work through his pain and even Bright Side herself had anticipated it, it just went to show how bone deep their connection was, it was beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. I dont know to be Gus without her, dude. Im fucking lost as shit. We finally get that little sliver of light in the form of Scout, I am not going to say too much about Scout but she was the wakeup call that Gus needed. He made her life hell, but she gave back as good as she got. The journey that these two went on was honest and real, no insta love, not even instant friendship but none the less a beautiful, sometimes hilarious read that will have your emotions all over the place. In the beginning these two were by no means perfect together, but they worked, they worked well, they were just what each other needed, they were there for each other, the right place at the right time. The way Kim Holden develops their relationship before your eyes was inspiring, that character connection resonates deep within and once again we have another character that you cannot help but love. He doesnt live life, he feels it. Ive seen it. Ive seen grief strangle him. And Ive seen happiness make him glow with a brightness so intense its almost blinding. Thats what makes him so special. Its not his talent or his looks. Its how much he feels. Once again though Bright Side is not forgotten, this book was a celebration of her life, how life became after Bright Side but noone would ever forget, forever at the forefront of peoples thoughts and memories and forever uttering or thinking what would Bright Side do? Every time she was mentioned the tears came, I just couldnt help it and my thoughts would wander back to that orange book that decimated me last year. It was great to catch up with all the characters, nobody was forgotten in this book, while this book is predominantly all about Gus, Guss journey would never be complete without his friends and they are all there as one big happy family, even Keller. This is what I loved, Kim Holden brought them all together, they were a unit, they may have lost the anchor that held them tethered together but those friendships were for life and life means life. This was one emotional journey, but it was a necessary evil, the good far outweighs the bad and the journey that Kim Holden takes you on to get there was well worth the tears and the tissues. You have to sit back and salute Kim Holden, the woman is a genius, Bright Side was EPIC, Gus was EPIC, this author is just EPIC. This woman knows how to nail character connection; she brings these people to life. She knows how to nail emotions, she makes me cry even when not intended but most of all you live and breathe it all and that is what I love in a book. I want it to be an experience and this is one experience I will never ever forget. I totally and utterly loved Bright Side but I can honestly say I loved Gus just as much. Not good things...but epic things. And Ive fallen in love with epic. Its the only way to live. Amazing job Kim Holden, you should be so proud, not only did you do Gus Hawthorne justice but us the reader too. You gave us a raw, emotional, yet uplifting story that will have mended many hearts. But I cant reiterate enough how much I respect the honesty in this book, it made it for me. It was real, it was believable, dude...it was EPIC. www.theromancecover.com
The nittygritty: Another unique world from Schwab, a touch of Shakespeare, and a fastpaced story that flew by much too fast. Humans were too fragile for this fight, but the Sunai were too few to do it alone, and even if three could wage a war on thousands, the Malchai and Corsai werent foolish enough to get close, opting instead for prey they could catch, and kill. And so the Sunai focused on hunting sinners in order to stem the flow of violence, and the slaying of the monsters fell to the humans, and the humans, invariable, fell to them. It was a cycle of whimpers and bangs, gruesome beginnings and bloody ends. So far Ive enjoyed everything Ive read by Victoria Schwab Vicious, A Darker Shade of Magic, The Archived and so I was very excited to start her new YA duology, The Monsters of Verity. And I was thrilled to find the same magical worldbuilding and earnest writing that Ive come to love about her books. This Savage Song has a unique idea that immediately sparked my imagination: in a future America, monsters are born from acts of violence. Imagine the emotional energy from an act of murder creating a creature out of the shadows. And then imagine what type of monster would be conjured from something really horrible like a bombing or mass suicide. In Schwabs world, the characters dont have to imagine. They are living in the midst of a world where three types of monsters roam free: the Malchai, who drink blood, the Corsai, who tear people apart with teeth and claws, and most dangerous of all, the Sunai, who absorb peoples souls by first mesmerizing them with music. The story has a definite Romeo  Juliet feel to it, with two feuding families controlling different parts of Verity City. Kate Harker is the daughter of Callum Harker, a ruthless man who rules over North City. Hes convinced the Malchai and Corsai to work for him, and people can pay Harker for their safety and protection. On the other side of the Seam, an invisible line that divides Verity, is South City, where Henry Flynn and his FTF Flynn Task Force are on the front lines, battling the monsters. Flynn has a secret weapon, though. He controlsor rather, hes accepted into his familythe only three Sunai in existence: Leo Flynn, the eldest brother and the most dangerous; Ilsa, the sister who is mostly mad and was responsible for creating the Barren, a swath of burned land where hundreds were killed; and the youngest, August, who wants nothing more than to be human. Twelve years ago, an event now called the Phenomenon occurred, and the monsters came into existence. After six years of bloodshed, the Harkers and the Flynns agreed upon a truce, with each group staying on their side of the city and protecting their citizens. But that truce is a shaky one, and any small act of aggression could easily end it. Just like Romeo and Juliet, August and Kate are destined to meet. Kate, who has just been kicked out of yet another boarding schoolin an attempt to get her fathers attentionhas finally been allowed to come home to VCity as its called, where she plans to show her father that she can be just as cruel and ruthless as he is. Meanwhile, August has convinced Henry to let him help the cause, but Henrys idea of helping is for August to enroll in Colton Academy and keep tabs on Callum Harkers daughter, who is also attending the school. Kate and August do meet and form a tentative friendship, but Kate is immediately suspicious of August and knows something is up with him, she just doesnt know whatyet. But after Kate is nearly killed in an attack by a gang of Malchai, August rescues her, knowing that in order to save her, he must reveal his true nature. Uneasy allies, August and Kate are now on the run from a plot to end the truce and start a war between monsters and humans. August was definitely my favorite character, although I really liked Kate as well. August is a monster who looks human and only wants to be normal, to fight Malchai and Corsai with the rest of the FTF, but his father is so protectiveremember, hes only one of three Sunai in existence. Hes a peaceloving teen who doesnt want to hurt anyone, really. But he can only go so long without eating before he starts to get really dangerous, and so his other side must make an appearance if hes to stay sane. Kates relationship with her father was great: shes willing to kill for him if it will make him love her, but deep down she knows what hes doing is wrong. I really loved the fact that there isnt a romance between Kate and August at least not in this book. Well see what happens in the next book, but for now Im satisfied with their unusual friendship. Schwab has created an intricate world with lots of rules, and as wonderfully creative as it is, heres where the story falters a bit for me. Blame it on being an adult reading YA if you want to, but I do tend to scrutinize fantasy worldbuilding. I think anyone who has been a book review blogger for as long as I have will sympathize and agree that its nearly impossible to read for pure entertainments sake. No matter how caught up in a story I get, my inner critic is still paying attention and weighing in whenever something doesnt make sense. Such was the case with This Savage Song. I had so many questions after finishing the book, and not the sort of ooh whats going to happen in the next book questions, but rather questions about elements of the world that just didnt make sense. Why are there only three Sunai? Why does August play the violin in order to feed but Ilsa sings? The violin was a seriously cool part of Augusts characterization, but in the end it just didnt make sense. August came into being already knowing how to play the violin? But he cant really play because every time he does, people die? And the weirdest thing to me, Colton Academy conveniently has soundproof practice rooms where August can play without killing anyone? In the end, the violin ended up being more of a prop than a necessary part of the story. My other issue with the story is that I had some trouble picturing exactly what the monsters looked like, which is weird since this story is about monsters. Schwab tends to describe them in broad brushstrokes, as having teeth and claws and being made of shadows. But as poetic as her writing is, those descriptions didnt quite satisfy my need for a clear visual. There is one exception, late in the story, when August goes dark and his monstrous side comes out. But even this didnt quite do it for me. I also noticed that lots of the violent action, where presumably the monsters and humans are attacking each other, takes place off the page, and we only hear about it after the fact. Theres blood aplenty flowing through these pages, and yet I felt detached from most of the horror. Because of this, I was never really scared of the monsters, and I wanted to be. But the truth is I gobbled up this book in only a couple of days and hey, thats fast for me!. The first half of the book is a careful setup for the second half, when the story takes off like a rocket. Schwabs deliciously tragic Shakespearean ending was perfect, and thank god, theres no cliffhanger to worry about. Small quibbles aside, I cant wait to read book two, because I do love this world, and I want to know more. Big thanks to the publisher for supplying a review copy.

The third book in the Hunger Games series, Mockingjay, starts with Katniss being rescued by the rebels and taken to District 13. Her former home, District 12, has been destroyed by the Capitol save for the Victors Village, which still stands amidst the ashes. The nearly 800 citizens of District 12 that Gale Hawthorne managed to save now reside within the underground compartments of District 13. Meanwhile, under the leadership of the rebels and coin, the President of 13, the other districts have been captured one by one; now an assault on the Capitol is being prepared. While Katniss was otherwise involved, she has become the symbol of the rebellion, just like the Mockingjay. Both were an anomaly of nature, both defied the wish of the Capitol and stayed alive. Now, it is up to Katniss to lead the rebellion and ensure that they overthrow the dictatorship of President Snow. Else, all that they strove for will be lost, along with District 13, their last hope. Peeta Mellark is still a captive and Katniss suspects he isnt well at all as seen on television. There is no immediate action to free him on part of the rebels. But when he notifies them of an impending attack, putting himself in grave peril in the process, is Katniss finally able to convince President Coin to put together a task force to free him. And free him they do, but at a terrible price. He has been brainwashed by the Capitol to think of Katniss as his enemy. After many a complications and losing friends, Katniss finally realizes she loves Peeta more than she thought she did. But now her emotional as well as physical stability is on the line as she tries to live up to the role of Mockingjay thrust upon her. Will she make it? Or will everything she did be in vain? Frankly, I did not like this book as much as I had hoped. It lacked the very things that I had liked in the first two installments. Firstly, the characters deteriorate as the plot progresses. The line between bravery and cowardice blurs. Many unfortunate events are made to occur just so the author can thwart any smart readers preconceived notions or predictions. And Katniss loses her strength of character and devolves into a sniveling, shocked female incapable of taking her own decisions. Shes either influenced by other peoples expectations of who she was, or who shes supposed to be. Her obsessive craving for Peetas love and finding faults with Gale is seriously annoying. I mean, cmon! You wanted Gale when you had Peeta, now you want Peeta when the line to Gale is clear as the summer sky?! And I do not buy the premise of this happening to her just because shes been under severe stress. She was under severe stress when she lived under the threat of starvation and the gladiatorlike Hunger Games. She was under severe stress when she got out of the first Hunger Games alive with Peeta. She was under severe stress all her short, eventful life! Then why buckle now? Why buckle when you have more people to look out for you than you ever did before? And Gale is the same as ever; just as strongwilled, just as determined. And now suddenly she starts feeling she doesnt belong with him. That he has too much fire. Where were you, dear dame, when the sweet, sweet Peeta was hankering for your undivided attention? Oh, right! You wanted Gales fire then. Huh! Also Prim gets killed off because Coin sends her out into the battle field as a rebel medic. Now that is just effing dumb! Where was her mother when the little girl got sent out in middle of a war zone? Shes supposed to be back to normal now. So shes also supposed to take care of the one precious thing shes got left. But that doesnt happen. Thats where I get hit with the disappointment overdose. Any more and I shall go numb with disappointment. But I wasnt that fortunate. I had to endure even more shots and jabs of the bitter medicine and see Katniss curl up and be dead to the outside world as the rest of the town rebuilds their lost homes in District 12. And then Peeta arrives, plants primroses under her window and she decides she wants to spend the rest of her life with him because, apparently, she needs Peetas love more than Gales legendary fire as she has plenty of that herself. Uh, excuse me, but didnt the Capitol just quench it with Prims murder? I mean, if there was any fire left within her, she wouldnt have been living like a hermit all these months. She would have gone out and tried to rebuild her life as the other were doing. So, no, there was no fire left in her. I have no problems with her ending up with Peeta. I loved the guy from the get go; but the reasons she gave for choosing him did not apply at the time she gave them. The ending was a little too abrupt and predictable for my liking. I would have liked if the author had applied her brilliant, predictionthwarting brain here instead of everywhere else in the book. She marries Peeta in the end just because hes the only option she has got left; because he was the only person who was as scarred as herself and would know her better. Well, that flimsy reason did not convince me. Id rather she had married him because she loved him and not because she had no other option. Verdict: Katniss Everdeen disappointed me. Recommended only for those who absolutely loved the first two books. Rating: 35 I wouldve given it 25, but 1 because I loved the fast, pacy writing which was the only consistent thing left in this book.  Edit: 10112012 Ive been wondering. Was I a bit too harsh in judging the last installment of one of my most favorite series? A friend of mine, whos also a fan of the series, read this review and was of he opinion that I was not getting into the characters skin to realize how Katniss felt during the situations that take place in the third book. She mentioned something about war veterans going through episodes of mental breakdown after the intense trauma of battles and skirmishes in the war zone. I did a little Googling and came across a few articles in psychology journals corroborating the same. Survivors of horrific accidents, traumatic episodes and wars experience withdrawal symptoms, altered personality, and paranoia; all of these traits were exhibited by Katnisss character in Mockingjay. In fact, now I think Suzanne Collins wrote a wellresearched piece of fiction when it came to her characters psyche. It was I who did not see the big picture. I hereby apologize for my somewhat unfair review of Mockingjay and revise my verdict and rating. Verdict: True to reality, Mockingjay portrays the lead characters emotions perfectly! Rating: 55  
The universe owes you nothing, Kady. It has already given you everything, after all. It was here long before you, and it will go on long after you. The only way it will remember you is to do something worth remembrance. This book took my heart and shattered it into a thousand pieces. I was an incoherent mess after finishing and, a day later, I still dont know what to do with myself. This is just a phenomenal book and perhaps one of the easiest five star reviews Ive ever given. You have no idea what youre missing out on if you havent read this yet! In all honesty, I didnt think Id like this at first. I was so hesitant to pick this book up because of the format. I thought  due to it being told through a dossier  that Id have no connection with the characters. Boy, could I not have been more wrong. I was somehow even more invested in these little shits. Which was, in retrospect, a bad idea due to the fact that so many people die. Theyre so full of determination and humour and a primal need to do whatever it takes to survive. I havent been this in love with a group of characters since ACOMAF. During the first 85 pages I was confused as hell. I think this is because Im not a huge scifi reader, and this world was just full of so many technical terms that I couldnt understand at first. I was considering giving up during those pages. Im so glad I didnt, though, because once I got passed them I was swept into a whirlwind of love and death and pain. My heart was constantly pounding in my throat as I clawed my way through this book. Ive never really felt such a vast array of feelings like this all at once! I think that, about half way through this book, I actually had an existential crisis. Illuminae was just such a beautiful collective of thoughts and emotions. Ive never read anything quite like it, and I dont think I ever will again. Miracles are statistical improbabilities. And fate is an illusion humanity uses to comfort itself in the dark. There are no absolutes in life, save death. Writing: The atmosphere of this book was astounding. Youll find that there are just so many quotable moments, especially towards the end. The way that Kaufman and Kristoff could blend humour and terror and hope all once was beautiful. I think they really got down to the core of what makes us human, and not many authors can do that in a way that really registers with a reader. These authors are just brilliant and I need all their other work right this second. I spent a lot of this book welling up, but when I got towards the end I was weeping like a baby. This novel is just so full of love and loss and hope and despair. I never thought a book that was told through a series of reports, IM chats, emails, and data logs could fill me with so many emotions, but it did. Every time I turned a page, something happened that threw everything I thought I knew out of orbit. I was constantly on my toes with my guard up but somehow, no matter how hard I tried to prepare myself, I never seemed to see anything coming. Honestly, Ive never had so much anxiety in my life. I also need to throw out a mention to the virus that was, for a lack of better words, fucking terrifying. It reminded me of intelligent zombies in a way. The way that the infected slowly lost themselves to madness was horrifying. BioTech did a seriously good job at creating a virus that could easily wipe out humanity. Stunning job, guys. I should have told you I loved you every day. I should have given you the stars. Characters: I honestly have no idea how they managed to do it, but the authors made me get attached to every character in this novel. I cried when they cried, I loved when they loved, and, when some of them died, a part of me died with them. Their development was done to perfection and they so often felt like real people to me. It wasnt just the main cast, either. There were a whole host of other characters who I loved and cherished. James, Dorian, Zhang, and so many more. The secondary characters really added a spark to this novel that I cant really explain. I just loved them all and, of course, had my heart broken because of it. Kady: My beautiful astroprincess. Kady is fierce, headstrong, intelligent, and has a strong sense of right and wrong. I think the book, especially towards the end, focuses on her humanity and her willingness to do anything to allow the people around her a chance to survive. She doesnt know the meaning of the word quit and I love her so much for that. She was, however, by no means perfect. She could be both selfish and selfless. She could be both loving and cold. She sometimes made decisions that were questionable at best but, given her situation, it was easy to understand her reasoning. The way her character loses so much and still manages to stand on her feet and fight until the bitter end really resonated with something inside of me. I want, with all my heart, to be like Kady. Ezra: Then theres my cinnamon roll. Ezra was sweet, kind, and hopelessly loyal. His unwavering love for Kady was one of the things I enjoyed the most about him. The banter and love that Ezra and Kady share was perhaps one of my favourite things about this novel. His dry humour was just brilliant and really help bring light into an otherwise dark novel. Everyone needs an Ezra in their life. AIDAN: What the hell, AIDAN. You cant just make me feel for you. Youre not even a human! AIDAN is the Artifical Intelligence system of the Alexander who somehow manages to become a character of its own. Its one duty is to prioritise and protect the fleet by whatever means necessary and, of course, thats where things go wrong. Once AIDAN meets Kady its mind begins to change and it suddenly finds itself able to think on its own. Its hatred for the fact that it could think and feel and yet wasnt human honestly broke my heart. As I said in my original review, its an Artificial Intelligence Network who comes down with a case of feelings. I actually found that, out of all the characters, I liked AIDAN the best. Which, after everything it does, was so surprising. I know most people hated AIDAN straight away, but I just couldnt. I think Ive always had a sense of ruthlessness, and I could understand what AIDAN was trying to do. AIDAN wanted to save as many people as it could and, lets face it, without his actions I think the ending would have seen absolutely no survivors. Plus, his sarcasm in the face of death was just brilliant. We all need sassy, insane AIs in our lives. WHEN I FOUND OUT IT WAS STILL FUNCTIONAL I WAS CRYING TEARS OF JOY! Are you afraid? Yes. Energy never stops, remember. It just changes forms. I am still afraid. And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the moment I started blubbering like a child. You have me. Until ever last star in the galaxy dies. You have me. Overall Everyone needs Illuminae in their lives. I know that there is a large amount of hype surrounding it, but I promise that its all entirely justified. Illuminae surprised me in the best of ways and I cant recommend a book more. It deserves more than five stars, I can tell you that. If youre afraid of it being difficult to read because of the format, dont be. Once you get used to the pattern and feel of the novel, youll find it impossible to put this book down. Thank you Yarravy for recommending me another beautiful book! Guess who wants to be a hacker now? Perhaps bravery is simply the face humanity wraps around its collective madness.
WOW!!! I honestly could not have asked for a better conclusion to this series. It went above and beyond my expectations, and while Im sad that this was the last book, I was definitely satisfied by the conclusion. Not to mention how beautiful the cover art is, am I right? Picking up where Cress left off, Winter dives right into the action, and doesnt slow down even once until the very end. I couldnt put the book down due to my intense need to find out what would happen next. Meyer does an amazing job switching between POV of each character. Each character has a distinct voice and I fell in love with all of them all over again. To very briefly sum it up: Cinder and her gang of eccentric friends must defeat the evil Queen Levana and secure the crown for the true heir, Princess Selene, aka Cinder. They face hella obstacles along the way and must risk everything to save both Lunar and Earth from Levanas rule. The four romantic couplings Kai and Cinder, Winter and Jacin, Cress and Thorne, Scarlet and Wolf were done excellently. Many YA books promise action and excitement as well as some romance on the side, but there are always some books that let the cheesy romance take over the entire plot, slipping in the action as an afterthought. That was not the case with this book. For startersCress and Thorne: HOLY CUTE. I loved them so much, Cress is so adorable and sweet and I loved reading from her perspective. When she was first introduced in her own book, she was always very unsure of herself and I viewed her as the real baby of the group. While I still wanted to protect and hug her in Winter, she definitely grew into herself as a strong heroine and kicked ass with all of her mad computer skills. There were so many times when I wanted to slap some sense into both her and Thorne and just scream KISS GOD DAMN IT!! but dont worry Cresswell shippers, you will be very pleased with how this all works out. As for Thorneswoon. He is such a goof and I love his sense of humor, and while he can be a dumb guy when it comes to girls, his protectiveness of Cress was pure GOLD. Kai and Cinder: This was one of the pairings that I really wanted more of, but because of how the story was structured they didnt get to spend as much time together as I would have liked. That being said, when they were together it was always great. Kai is such a nice and genuine person and I felt so bad for him bc of all the Queen Levana crap he had to deal with. Cinder was incredible in Winter. She was strong, brave and resourceful and I was consistently impressed with how she handled all of the shit thrown her way. Shes just so cool. Her romance with Kai couldve used more intensity and passion, but with the circumstances they were given, they made it work. Much love for these two. Scarlet and Wolf: Ugh. Talk about shitty circumstances! I love love LOOVE Scarlet so much. She is probably the toughest, bravest, most badass girl of them all and I was obsessed with every single scene she was in. Her reunion with Wolf was perfect and I didnt want it to end. They cant seem to catch a break in this book. I wish they could have spent more time together, but the time they were given was EPIC. Wolf is so hardcore and scary when it comes to everything but Scarlet. It made my heart happy to see him turn into such a teddy bear around her. He is bae and Ill leave it at that. Sooo many feels when it comes to these two I cant really put it into words. Winter and Jacin: It is an extreme understatement to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much I ended up liking the dynamic between Jacin and Winter. Originally I didnt get much of a feel for what Jacin was like and I wasnt sure if I was going to like him. And boy was I wrong!! He was so devoted to Winter and was ready to do whatever it took to keep her safe. I always eat up any kind of protectiveness in male characters and Jacin was one of the best ones yet. Winter was such an interesting character. I loved the way Jacin understood her, despite her problems with Lunar sickness. He was there for her no matter what and I LOVED it. Obviously I am a little too obsessed with these two. As for Queen Levana... I have nothing but great things to say about this series. With each book the plot gets better and Winter was by far the best one yet. The plot is so intense and exciting that I found myself gasping for air while reading. I was so nervous about whether or not my faves would survive that it was hard not to read it at the speed of light. But I forced myself to chill out and appreciate the writing. The entire story is action packed and I promise you that if you liked the first three, you will ADORE this one. 10 stars!!
Actual rating: 1.5 I was so, so excited when I won an ARC of this book through Goodreads. The blurb drew me right in with its promises of witches and darkness. They keep him in a cage?! Dark and Light witches in an epic battle?! Whats not to like? How disappointing this turned out to be for me. For all the talk of witches, theres virtually no magic in this book at all. Each witch gets three gifts when they turn 17. Throughout the book, we get vague descriptions of these gifts, like potionmaking or invisibility, but very rarely were those gifts ever demonstrated by any witch. Mostly, we are told soandso has suchandsuch gift. Thats about it. The book follows the MC, Nathan, from the time he is about 11 or so until he turns 17. His goal is to get his three gifts at 17, because he believes that if he does not receive his gifts through the gifting ceremony, traditionally overseen by a family member, he will die. Nathan is designated as a halfcode because he is the son of a white witch and a black. His father, as it happens, is the most notorious and hunted black witch of all time. By all accounts, the man is evil  he abandoned Nathan and his mother, and he is known for murdering many white witches to take their powers because his gift, apparently, is the ability to take other witches gifts. The first 16 pages were in second person present, which in my humble opinion, should neverbe used as a narrative style outside a Choose Your Own Adventure book. It was jarring. I assume it was meant to place me in Nathans shoes and make me feel closer to him, more sympathetic, but it had the exact opposite effect on me. From there the story switched to first person present. I normally dont notice the tense in which a book is written, but I suspect that may relate to the authors skill in using it. For instance, The Hunger Games are written in FPP, but I never noticed the tense or felt like it was holding the story back. Not so in this book. In this book, the writing felt very wooden, almost juvenile. It was very stunted. I sit down. I see her fingers. The table is dirty. There just wasnt any flair or style to the writing that stood out to me and made me excited to keep reading it. There wasnt enough action or description to hold my interest. Its like reading a documentary. A very dry documentary. There were other annoyances, too. Use of the word round instead of around. As in, he puts his arm round me. The biggest problem I had with the book, though, is the MC himself. I hated Nathan. Ive read many books with terrible MCs that I nonetheless loved, but in this case I found Nathan so unlikable that I could not feel the sympathy towards him I know I was meant to feel. From very early on in the book, even before hes allowed to be out and about in society, Nathan was just an asshole. To pretty much everyone. For no discernible reason. At that point, we know only that his grandma had told him not to talk with anyone about his father, and that his halfsister, Jessica, hates him because of his heritage. Other than that, though, he is accepted in his household, and loved. So why, then, does he act out all the damn time?! Hes too young and inexperienced at that point to have the hardened, soulless shell of someone whos been abused or discriminated against for some lengthy amount of time, so stop acting like such a jerk already! Nathan grins too much. Always grinning. Most often, hes grinning at inappropriate times. Like when asked a question by someone he doesnt feel like answering. Like an asshole. I dont know if it was a lack of vocabulary holding Green back, or if that was genuinely part of his characterization, but each time he acted inappropriately, it just reinforced my belief that hes an instigator. Its like it was meant to show him as a fearless badass or a survivor, but it just annoyed me. Since I was turned off to him early on, it made later scenes, again drawn to make me feel sympathetic towards him, just seem nonsensical and silly. Some of those scenes were quoted by people in favorable reviews, like when he kneels down before his brother in an effort to make a point and sarcastically asks permission to use the restroom. Again, I felt like he was just being an asshole to one of the few people trying to help him. He is written as such an instigator that I felt throughout the entire book that he brought a lot of unnecessary grief on himself. At one point, he just started beating the shit out of a guy who was trying to help him. Why? Who the fuck knows?! He was all petulant that the guy didnt immediately trust him, yet his own trust issues run so deep that he wouldnt even tell the guy his real name. Hypocrite. Another thing that pissed me off was his obsession with his father. Again, the massmurderer who abandoned him. He was convinced that daddy still loved him, was watching over him, that the grass was greener, and that everyone else must be wrong, thus he must find daddy and live happily ever after. Why!? What possible explanation is there for this behavior? If he had been imprisoned yet, or grown up unloved, I would get it. But, he lived with his grandmother in a loving home. There was no rational explanation for him being on his fathers side. Even the cage promised in the blurb didnt turn out to be the horrible sinister thing youd expect. See, for some arbitrary reason, Nathan cannot be indoors at night, thus he cannot sleep indoors at night. He is eventually removed from his grandmas care and taken to be fostered by someone chosen by the government. He suspects they want to train him and eventually use him to access and kill his father. In any event, he cant stay inside at night, so to prevent him from running, he sleeps outside in a large cage. During the day, he does chores and trains. Some of the training is definitely of an abusive nature, but even his captor treats him pretty well, all things considered. She isnt the monster shes supposed to be. Its clear she cares for him, wants to protect him, and though her training methods are a little on the sadistic side, its almost akin to corporal punishment. Now, dont get me wrong. There are certainly points at which he is actively mistreated and discriminated against by others in society who assume that because he is a halfcode, he is black and evil. He is tortured at points  beaten and scarred  but because I felt so disconnected from him it had very little effect on me. That I didnt connect with his story makes me feel a bit like a monster. The love story was so tepid and unrealistic that it really had no business being in the story at all. That girl could just have easily just been the one kid at school who was nice to him. In fact, thats about what she was. Somehow, that got turned into shes the one I love. It takes up very few pages. Theres little development of their relationship. The first two thirds of the book move incredibly slow. So. Slow. Which is strange considering it covers about 5 or so years of his life. The last third picks up the pace a bit more, but I remained at the point where Id long since stopped caring what happens. I skimmed the last chapter or two because I was so ready to be done with this book. Between the writing style and my dislike of the MC, this book just wasnt for me, much to my disappointment.
4.5 stars Last night, I returned from Star Wars on an emotional high. Despite the facts that it was 10:30, I had over 300 pages left, and I had to be up for work in the morning, I decided that it was the perfect time to finish Winter. See, hype can make it tough for me to tap into my emotions, and I was already emotional, so really it WAS a great time for me to finish, even if I am really tired now. Worth it. The Lunar Chronicles has been amazing from start to finish, which I say with extra confidence having just reread the earlier books as well. Going back before I started Winter was very nice, not just because I didnt remember some important plot things from Cress and also wanted to see if my opinions on certain ships had changed ahem, but because I can see the planning that went into the series now in ways that I couldnt before. Reading Cinder, I had no idea what the scope of the series would be or how things would turn out, aside from the defeat of the evil queen and happiness of the ship because fairy tale. I never could have imagined the grand scope that Meyer put together. Going back through the series, it was obvious that Meyer had everything planned out, at least the big picture stuff, when she wrote Cinder. I think thats why this is one of the best series enders Ive read. Last night, I returned from Star Wars on an emotional high.

Going back through the series, it was obvious that Meyer had everything planned out, at least the big picture stuff, when she wrote Cinder. I think thats why this is one of the best series enders Ive read. Given the fact that I was pretty much positive going in that I knew how the series would end, due to fairy tale archetypes, Meyer did manage to surprise me. Winter was more violent and intense than I expected for one thing. And its all made extra painfully stabby by the fact that friends have to deal the blows on friends. On top of that, I was actually surprised that it didnt end with four weddings in grand Shakespeareanfairy tale style. In fact, the ships are left open and are clearly going to take some time before they marry, which makes me happy. I was tentatively on board CressThorne finally, and it really helps knowing theyre not going to make any rash decisions . Shipping has always been somewhat turbulent for me in this series, my ships waxing and waning with each book and even each read of each book. Having finished a full read of the series for the first time, I can tell you that I think Ive come down with this order on the ships: KaiCinder, CressThorne, WolfScarlet, and WinterJacin in last place. I dont know what it is about the steadiness of Kai and Cinder that I adore, but I guess I just really love the strong heroine constantly saving her boyfriend. Kai is the only one in the series who never does anything with physical strength his own or manipulated, which is really pretty fascinating. He ends up being more useful than I would have thought, and his behavior towards Cinder at the end is so fucking cute. In general, I love that, in each ship, the girl really calls the shots. Even Cress pretty much rules Thorne because he totally forgets how to buckle swashes around her. More than the ships, though, I really love the dynamic of the whole group. Meyer shuffles the group around a lot in the last two books, so they basically all get to know each other at least a little bit, and I love the interactions. Cress and Wolf have some good moments together where she learns to stop fearing the sweet puppy who just misses his girlfriend. There are some great CressKai moments in Winter too. Scarlet and Winter have an amazing friendship arc View Spoiler . Not to mention CinderIko, who have been strong from the first. I also love that it seems like Iko might get her own bit of hotness in the fullness of time. GET IT, GURL. There are just two things that could have made this series better in my opinion. Firstly, Everything would have been imbued with so much more tragedy if Meyer had succeeded in making Levana a tragic figure. I think thats what Fairest was meant to do, and, it almost worked, but and totally would have been a great ship if Meyer decided to kill some folk and embrace ff destroyed what sympathy I had for her horrible childhood. She was actually too much of a monster and a villain, making everything really black and white. That does fit fairy tale archetypes, but oh man the pain when you also care just a wee bit about the villains. Secondly, The Lunar Chronicles is depressingly heteronormative. I mean, I could blame fairy tales for that I guess, but, yeah, Im not going to. Now that publishing is letting LGBT books through much more regularly, Im so disappointed that theres not even the slightest hint of anyone not being one hundred percent straight in this whole massive series. Just no. As Gillian Writer of Wrongs said when I talked about this with her, Jacin so easily could have been Jacinda. The Snow White story would clearly be there with a lady guard just the same. sighs If youve not started The Lunar Chronicles, theres no reason to wait; its complete and its got a wonderful ending. Though I totally get waiting for the hype to die down. If youve not finished, GO FOR IT. The Lunar Chronicles is one of my favorite series, and I cannot wait for what Meyer does next though I hope it embraces all the colors of the rainbow.
I buddy read Scarlet with a close real life friend after we had read Cinder together. Dis rating:  Alissas Rating:  Both of us enjoyed Scarlet more than its predecessor and there was a distinct evolution in Meyers writing and characterisation. We both connected to the character of Scarlet more easily than we had connected with Cinder and she is a pretty kickass lead to have in a YA bookseries like this. There was nothing outstanding that she could do, there were no particular talents that she had and yet she was smart and witty with a quiet determination and a quick temper that made her easily relateable. The new characters were well thought out and well placed in the story and the scifi world was better fleshed out with a much greater sense of place than we ever got from Cinder. Thorne was a wonderful contrast to the rest of the cast and provided some interesting dynamics and the interactions between him and Cinder made me warm to Cinder as a character more than I had in the previous book. Platonic friendships are something that really need to be explored more in YA! A relieved grin filled up Thornes face. Were having another moment, arent we? If by a moment, you mean me not wanting to strangle you for the first time since we met, then I guess we are. The fact that Wolf had such an interesting backstory and such a compelling characterisation made the interactions between Wolf and Scarlet that much more engaging which impacted the entire book for the better!. Their romance felt somewhat rapid although natural and I think young love can easily happen over a matter of days. She sighed, annoyed at her restlessness. So, she said, disrupting Wolf in another backward glance. Who would win in a fightyou or a pack of wolves? He frowned at her, all seriousness. Depends, he said, slowly, like he was trying to figure out her motive for asking. How big is the pack? I dont know, whats normal? Six? I could win against six, he said. Any more than that and it could be a close call. Scarlet smirked. Youre not in danger of low selfesteem, at least. Kais storyline with Levana also made him a more interesting character as now hes more than just a romantic lead and more than simply the troubled Prince Charming. His character had to stand on its own two feet instead of feeding off interactions with Cinder and we both found him a much more enjoyable persona. The plot was faster paced with more action and more reveals than we previously saw in Cinder which also made for a better read and while this was built on the foundation of Cinder, this book definitely made that storyline more enticing. Its fun and exciting, action packed and heartbreaking with an emphasis on the bonds of family, great friendships and girl power.      Spoilers Ahead! Proceed at your own Risk!  With Cinder, we first discussed what parallels we drew between. What did we see in Scarlet? A: I was disappointed in the parallels between Red Riding Hood and Scarlet. D: I enjoyed the way that Meyer brought in the wolf in Grandmothers clothing  and the fact that the eyes were what gave him away... What big eyes you have! . I think Little Red Riding Hood hasnt been done so often so there wasnt a lot to draw from  the red hood, the scene where the wolf is lying in the bed pretending to be the grandmother  the main stuff was there. Although... In the fairy tale a huntsman comes by and saves the pair  which Wolf did at the headquarters... I just like the way shes interpreted it and twisted it a little. What do you think of Iko? What do you think will happen to her? A: Im glad they brought her back because she is the only one left from Cinders old life D: Agreed  I hate it when YA protagonists have no friends or history. I hope she gets a new droid body for her sake. A: Im getting a real Zaphod Beeblebrox vibe from Thorne and an Eddie vibe from Iko. D: Ahhh. Captain Thorne. He was one my favourites actually and I got a bit of a Hans Solo vibe from him at times. A: Im shipping Thorne and Cinder, I dont care about Kai. D: I dont think that Cinderella can be without her Prince Charming, and I thought Kai was a much stronger character in this book. I wonder how well get around him marrying Levana. A: Speaking of plot devices  I really thought that Cinders cyborg brain recollection was too convenient and an immature plot device. D: Yes, I agree. My eyes rolled a bit at that scene but luckily it was back in the first parts of the book and the story and total plot arc didnt really hinge on how or where this information came from. D: So, we took a little while to get to the reviewing of this one. Are you up for reading Cress soon? I do specifically remember being rather excited for it at the end of this book. A: Absolutely. If we leave it too much longer well have to reread the other two!
6 Stars!!! In love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are. WOW...Just WOW! This is one BEAUTIFUL book. Ive got ugly tears running down my face right now. I just love this quote and it beautifully and succinctly summarizes this book. For almost a year, Ive heard so much buzz about this book, but somehow I couldnt get myself to read it...maybe because of the historical background. Well, there is a lot of war in this book, but this book is so much more than war. This is a story about humanity and how far we will go to save a stranger. It is a story about family and love. It is an empowering story about the inner strength and endurance of women. It is HEARTWRENCHING! It looks at society and how peoples fear can cloud sound judgment. It asks the hard questions of how far will we go to protect our loved ones? How much can we take before we break? This book follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, and their struggles during World War II. Although sisters, they are not friends. Abandoned by their father at an early age, both struggle to find love, acceptance, and their place in life. As the war comes to France, Vianne and Isabelle find their strength and learn to survive the war. They both grow throughout the process and make their mark on the war. Im not a history buff, but after reading this novel and knowing that Kristin Hannah was inspired by true stories, I am completely in awe and want to learn more about this time period. This book is so wonderful and I have so many emotions running through me right now. Im not sure how to write this review. I guess Ill just tell you about how this book will make you feel and what I hope youll gain from this book. Ill be honest...it took me awhile to really get into the book. Dont get me wrong, the entire book is good, but I wasnt hooked until about 30 so keep reading if you are unsure about this book. At this point I just became so invested in their story and what it must have been like to live through WWII. I was so engrossed in the story; I was emotionally in sync with Vianne and Isabelle. I felt myself trudging along and trying to be strong just like Vianne and Isabelle. Only until the end did I relax and allow myself to grieve for all of their loss. Im grieving and reminiscing on their journey. It is now at the end of the book that I can fully appreciate this story and all the beauty and wisdom it has to offer. Vianne and Isabelle are very different characters. Isabelle is naive, impetuous, and freespirited. In contrast, Vianne is older, wiser, and more responsible and cautious in life. However, both sisters are insecure and flawed in their own way. Each sister takes their own path in the war. Both have their own crises and question ethics, morals, and how to live a meaningful life. They make mistakes, hurt people, and they are both pushed to their breaking pointthey find out who they really are and what they are willing to sacrifice to make a better world. Their growth is beautiful to watch. I could only hope I would do the same in their situation. Dont think about who they are. Think about who you are and what sacrifices you can live with and what will break you. I found myself liking Isabelle more than Vianne which is interesting since I am more like Vianne in real life. I admired Isabelle so much. Her strength and courage was amazing. But as Vianne began to grow and mature, I really started to like her character as well. It was a proud moment when she realizes what she must to do live with herself in the war. She knew now that no one could be neutralnot anymoreand as afraid as she was of risking Sophies life, she was suddenly more afraid of letting her daughter grow up in a world where good people did nothing to stop evil, where a good woman could turn her back on a friend in need. There are so many wonderful messages and lessons in this book. How do we pick up the pieces and move on from such terror? How do we survive such hate? How do we overcome such evil? But love has to be stronger than hate, or there is no future for us. This story emphasizes that our ability to love is one of the most powerful forces. Love keeps the spirit alive. It has the potential to heal, to build and rebuild the future for us. It emphasizes the strength in us women and how we piece it all together and move the future along. It makes me so proud to be a woman. They couldnt touch my heart. They couldnt change who I was inside. My body...they broke that in the first days, but not my heart, V. The story also touches on our need for love and belonging. Isabelle, Vianne, and their father have a strained relationship. No matter how much they try to resist needing one another, their bond and need to be loved by one another is strong and everlasting. A girls love for her father. Immutable. Unbearable but unbreakable. Its a story that emphasizes forgiveness, to live in the moment, and to appreciate and love one another while we are alive. The story has tragedy pervading every scene. Its a realistic story of grief and loss. I like happy endings because I know in life sometimes there are no happy endings. Books are my escape. This story doesnt have a bad ending, just a realistic one that breaks my heart. Some stories dont have happy endings. Even love stories. Maybe especially love stories. However, despite all the loss and grief, there is a silver lining. While the book reminds us that even though not all endings are happy, the life lived and how we lived is what matters. Its the memories and the love found that carry us through. I know now what matters, and it is not what I have lost. It is my memories. Wounds heal. Love lasts.

It is a story of strength, love, courage, and sacrifice. This is a MUST read!!
MY REACTION AFTER READING THE BOOK: It is obvious that I liked this book. But why did I give it four stars? Well Ill explain later. THE GIST Jacqueline and Kennedy has been going out since high school and because of her love for him, she followed him to the college of his choice despite her wanting to go to where she prefers. What she wasnt expecting was Kennedy dumping her two month into their sophomore year for a very stupid reason if you ask me. Of course, Jacqueline was devastated Who wouldnt be??!. She was distraught and she didnt know how to begin because her life literally revolved around Kennedy and her friends oh, Kennedys friends! My mistake. The book started when Jacqueline was assulted by Buck, Kennedys frat brother but was saved by mysterious Lucas who Jacqueline never noticed until that day. It turns out Lucas was from her Economics class and she just noticed him sketching and staring at her from behind the class. Lucas was attractive and she couldnt deny that. Her friends told her that she needed a rebound and they though Lucas was the perfect one. But will she be ready for that immediately after her break up with Kennedy, the guy who she has been for three years? Can she throw all of that way? Will she be able to trust Lucas who was keeping secrets of his own? FIRST IMPRESSION The cover says it all really it shows us how H.O.T Lucas was! JK. But really, the title, the cover and the synopsis was enough for us to pick up the book. The title was one word but it was very catchy. Youll ask yourself why was the title called Easy? Was it because they think the girl was easy or was the guy easy? I needed to know! And guess what I found the answer by the end of the book! Crazy huh?! CHARACTERS Jacqueline not Jackie She was smart and a very loyal girlfriend. She was also a good musician. I felt her pain and I knew immediately that she deserved someone better way better than that asshle Kennedy. What happened to her was nothing I could relate to but I understood her choice to stay quiet about the whole thing. She was scared which was understandable. She wasnt perfect even though she seems to be because she was smart and everything. Also, usually I am not a fan of girls like her. She built her world around Kennedy and I thought that was why it pained her so much but Ill make an exception for her. I love Jacqueline. Lucas or Landon What is not to love about this guy? He was mysterious and sexy which made me want more of him. But there was a lot more to this guy than meets the eye. Lucas does have a secret and its pretty severe. I hated that he had to deal with something like that but all the more that it made me want him more. I like that hes an artist. I am always attracted to an artsy guy. I never would have thought that someone with a bad boy image could be so artsy. I like the irony in that. Kennedy I knew you were an ass from the start. I guess thats about what I have to say about this guy. You immature piece of sht! Sorry for the cursing guys!! I just cant help it. Erin The bestest girlfriend ever! I love this girl. I knew in my heart that this girl would stick by Jacqueline. When she knew about what happened she went as far as breaking up with her boyfriend because he wouldnt believe his frat brother was capable of doing something like raping someone. I love love Erin! Buck Another piece of worthless FKAFH:EIRABFI! The world will be a much better place without people like this guy! ROMANCE LUCAS  JACQUELINE  STEAMY MATURE RELATIONSHIP Lucas and Jacqueline were both mature and because of that I think theyll be perfect together. They didnt rush things and that was good but there were tons of steamy scenes which will leave you envious! Hahaha. Well yeah! Lucas is quite the lover. : QUOTABLE QUOTES Love is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated  heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart.  Youre full of contradictions, Ms. Wallace. I looked up at him and arched a brow. Im a girl. Thats part of the job description, Mr. Maxfield. Bonus: I now knew what Erin meant by lickable abs. As for being somewhere youre not supposed to beMaybe youre here for a reason, or there is no reason. The truth was, he now belonged only to my past, and it was time I begin to accept it, as much as it hurt to do so. HIGHLIGHTS  The topic of the story was sensitive but it was made in a way that anyone will be able to make it as if its not overly dramatic.  The relationship between LucasLandon and Jacqueline was natural. It is not every day that we see a book where opposites attract in a nonparanormal way.  The bad guy pissed the hell out of me which is a good thing because it meant that he was effective.  The conclusion of the book was just what I expected it to be. FINAL THOUGHTS Like what I said with my review on But I love him, I am a fan of books that deals with serious stuff. In But I love him, it dealt with abuse in relationship. I didnt like it because I had fun reading something like that but because it made me feel hot terrible it must have been to be hurt by someone you love. Easy deals with another sensitive topic, rape. This book didnt give me the sick feeling in my stomach like what Speak did. Speak was another book about rape wherein no one understood the main character when she decided to call the police that night when she was raped. Jacqueline was lucky enough not to have dealt with something like that because the author didnt want us to deal with that type of drama but only want us to be aware that it could happen to you, to a friend or to someone you might not know. The good thing about this book was not about just the romance part. I mean the romance part of it was good. I loved Jacqueline and Lucas relationship because it was built on something other than pure lust or physical attraction. This book was not hard to love. It will affect you in more ways that one. You will connect to both the characters and the story. I initially rated this book a three because of its predictability. Three for me was not bad. It was good actually. It means that I liked it. But thinking back as I write this review i felt that it was unfair if I rated it a three just because it was predictable because everything else about it was good. So I changed it to Four stars. I couldnt rate it a Five though but four stars means this book was very good and that i will be recommending it to everyone. You might be wondering why the title of this book was Easy. I believe I written it down on my first impressions that I was wondering the same thing. Lucas answered my question on the last paragraphs of the book. I think this was a good way to end the book and also explain what the title Easy meant At least for me. Choosing to be with you isnt a difficult decision, Jacqueline. he breathed, pulling back one final time to stare into my eyes. Its easy. Incredibly easy. A seriously happy reader! :
hi Guys! Maria here today I am going to be discussing My Lady Jane by Cynthia Hand Brodi Ashton and Jodi Meadows. This is probably the first book that I have read to completion in a while. The last book I read was The Crowns Game and that put me in a reading slump. I got this in my I got this in my Owl Crate Box and I decided to give it a go on the count its a standalone novel that involved royalty in it. This book does not disappoint, it is probably the one of the most entertaining books I have read in a while. A lot of my highly anticipated releases this year have disappointed me, and I havent been giving books high star ratings lately but this book made me happy. The book is extremely FUNNY and it kind of reminds of of those Comedy Central movies that involve a medieval setting where it just plan ridiculous in how funny it can be. There is a funky narration that just keeps coming back throughout the story, which intertwines with the real history of Lady Jane Grey Nine day ruler of England, and it just brighten by day. So without farther adue its get started with the plot This might contain some spoilers: I am going to be talking about the plot in my own words. Lady Jane Grey is a forgotten ruler in history, she was King Edwards first cousin. The story starts with this funny narration talking about the real history of Lady Jane Grey. then it goes off talking about this is what really happened we threw in some fantasy they go on about people turning into animals called the Edians normal people are called Verities just to make you happy and this is what the narrators wanted to happen. the story starts with Edward dying of this Affliction which is just great for him. Looking this actually up I found out that King Edward died at the age of 15 not 16 but I want to excuse that. So since he is dying he has to figure out whos going to run the kingdom after he passes. He decided not on his sisters Mary and Elizabeth Bloody Mary and Elizabeth the first on real life terms and decides with John Dudley the Duke of some land I forget the name to to force his youngest son Gifford into marriage with Edwards first cousin Lady Jane Grey. The only problem with Gifford is that he turns into a horse during the light hours and becomes a man at night. the problem with Lady Jane is that she does not want to get married she kind of just wants to be stuck in a book. when Edward finds out that everybodys been trying to poison him and he doesnt have the affliction he runs away to his grandmothers house and meanwhile Jane and Gifford are trying to figure each other out. The intertwining problems come together and ultimately get it all three characters in to solve the big issues. All the problems resolved itself by the end of the story, and they live happily ever after. I dont want to go into further detail than that on account of spoilers. Characters: Lady Jane Grey: She was a very cute character. She was very witty and intellectual for a young lady of that time. She does grow throughout the entire story trying to figure her life out with Gifford. Most of the book revolves around Gifford and Janes love story which is bubbly and cute. they figure each other out by the end of the story and eventually fall madly in love for each other. She ends up being a Ferret. Gifford: He is a horse for most of the book and only transforms into a man at night. This is because he cannot control his Ethian form, which I dont know why everyone else was able to but he couldnt. At first, Jane thinks that Gifford is a massive pervert but in all reality he was just trying to hide his strange obsession with poetry. He is kind of biased towards women as well but since this was set in the fifteen hundreds I kind of bypass that. This book was really empowering towards the women of this tale by the end of the book. the best part of this book was that they said that Gifford was the one who wrote Shakespeares plays, hahaha. Edward: The only thing I didnt like about this book actually was the relationship between Gracie and Edward. I thought it was a little bit rushed and I didnt see why they liked each other. Of course it goes on about how Edward thought she was attractive and all this crap, but the most important question was WHY. I felt like Jane and Giffords love story was so much more developed than Edward and Gracies, but also it could have been because the narrators even said it themselves that its about Gifford and Jane and not Edward and Gracie. He turns into a bird forgot to mention that. Gracie: She Gotta remind me of She Gotta remind me of Aelin a little bit. Her house was burned down her whole family was inside she ran away she joined up with the guild of some sort. does it remind you of anyone Cough CELEANA SARDOTHIEN Cough. Okay I said enough but she wears trousers and Edward thought she was attractive and she helps the characters along the way. She turns into a fox. Grans: Kickbutt Grans enough said. turns into a skunk. Mary: shes kind of like the main antagonist but kind of not the main antagonist. shes really not much of a threat even though in history Bloody Mary was a really big threat. this was a standalone novel I understand that they really couldnt build up her character more. she ended up turning into a donkey and thats the end of her by the end. Elizabeth: probably the most mature person out of the entire book. She knows who was supposed to rule but even though she thinks that she ends up being the ruler at the end. Shes not very that prominent shes just there to be the voice of reason for everything. She turns into a cat. John Dudley: He is probably more of the antagonist of this book. Hes the one who tries to poison Edward so he can get his son on the throne AKA making him the one in charge. A lot of people are in on it too, which I did not understand. They already had basically the kingdom because Edward didnt do much so why were they can play in the first place! I didnt understand his motivation but at the end he is taken down by his son Gifford. there are other side characters but they are not very prominent to the story. Conclusion: There was some technical issues with this book but I overlooked it on the counter its a standalone novel and the writing was very quirky. If it was a series I would love to see more of this universe with the Ethians and the Verities but I know thats not going to happen so yeah. I gave this book of 4.5 Stars and I believe people should pick it up its really good its very lighthearted. one thing is for sure everyone gets naked in this book because when they transform all their clothes disappear for some reason. Everyone likes cheese and THEY KISS AND KISS. Hahaha.... the naration is a Woot. Dont forget the VERY SPECIAL HUG! Byeee
Pandemonium by Lauren Oliver is the followup to Delirium read my review here and continues the story of Lena. She has successfully escaped into the Wilds but all is not well. Alex didnt make it and she really has no chance of surviving on her own until she is rescued by Raven and a group of Homesteaders. What follows SHOULD have been the story of Lenas continued growth and survival but instead turned into yet another YA love triangle. Synopsis: Im pushing aside the memory of my nightmare, pushing aside thoughts of Alex, pushing aside thoughts of Hana and my old school, push, push, push, like Raven taught me to do. The old life is dead. But the old Lena is dead too. I buried her. I left her beyond a fence, behind a wall of smoke and flame. Goodreads.com This book jumps between the Now and the Then. Now is Lena, involved in the resistance efforts, trying to acquire intel about the DFA DeliriaFree America and Julian Fineman, the son of Thomas Fineman, DFAs leader. Its all very Alias of her. Then, just as a chapter set in the NOW starts to get interesting and you want to keep reading to find out what is going on, Oliver jumps to the THEN, where we find out what happened to Lena after she escaped into the Wilds. Her struggles for survival, building strength, meeting new people and trying to make ends meet in a world where she is now unwanted. Just as the THEN starts to get interesting, BOOM, Oliver throws readers back into the NOW. It became very annoying to me as a reader, this back and forth tug of war. I can only think she thought it was a way to build tension and interest in the inevitable climactic moments but to me, it was like getting a small taste of something and then having it cruelly withheld. It was not good story telling for me at all. Id much prefer a NOW section and a THEN section rather than this indecision as to where to lead readers. Now, this is just my reading preference and Im betting not every reader is going to have this same problem with the back and forth as I did. My other major, major problem with this book is that I found it utterly predictable from start to finish. I could easily foresee the twists and turns that were coming for Lena. That certain characters were not as they appeared and that loyalties would definitely be tested. I am an end reader but for this book I did not have to read the end at all because I knew exactly what would happen and lo and behold, I was almost one hundred percent correct. Suspense just was not possible for me because I wanted to tell Lena dont you see these connections?? I can tell you what is going to happen girl! but of course, since I cant talk to fictional characters, I could not quite do that. That being said, I did like the images Lauren Oliver painted in my mind, particularly of NYC. Times Square was utterly spooky and devoid of the life and sparkle it is now in present times in Pandemonium. It fit the mood of the book. This was a very different United States and Lauren Oliver made that very, very clear. Finally, the third most disappointing aspect of this book is that a love triangle was setup. And this grates on my nerves to no end. I loved seeing Lena in the THEN portions of the story because it really showed how she had to grow up and frankly man up in the Wilds. She had made her choice and now she had to live with it or basically die because those were her only two options. She had to contribute by making their homestead a liveable place and she did. She grew stronger, both physically and mentally, and really became a character I admired because she had to deal with a lot of harsh realities. Then, throw her into the NOW portions of the story and she becomes a lovesick fool which I realize, given that deliria is a disease of love is a horrible comparison to make but she truly does. It became more about the new guy than about her own safety and survival. I guess I seem a bit uncaring here and maybe Im more hardened than Lena but I thought it had to have been possible to see her character melded from both these different situations, rather than falling back to someone I didnt recognize. The ending was incredibly anticlimactic again because I knew what was going to happen. The only way I can see to fix this is to stop reading so many books I guess? But sometimes, Id like to see characters who are supposed to be dead stay truly dead and yes, Im looking at you Vampire Diaries TV show. Did Vicky really have to come back??. I will finish off the trilogy when the final book comes out but my expectations are going to be nil. That seems to be the best way to approach a lot of these dystopian stories that are currently flourishing in YA world. However, when its all said and done, if Delirium was popular in your library and is still circulating well, this is a natural purchase. And in some ways, I think this fits the bill nicely of scifi romance readers too. While I may be burned out on love triangles, not all readers are, and teens are notorious for choosing sides. This will have many fans, Im just not leading the pack.
4 Not just a Game STARS Welcome, welcome to Caraval! The grandest show on land or by sea. Inside youll experience more wonders than most people see in a lifetime. You can sip magic from a cup and buy dreams in a bottle. But before you fully enter into our world, you must remember its all a game. Scarlett Dragna is the daughter of Trisdas governor. With her little sister Donatella Tella have shared a life of abuse and overcontrol by their father, which punishes them for everything. Forced to never leave the island they were born, they dream to escape their fathers power. And then, the opportunity comes when they are given tickets for Caraval. Caraval is more than a circus. It is an experience, one in a lifetime experience. For years Scarlet has send letters to the man responsible for the show to come to her island and let them experience it, but she has never had an answer. Now, after 7 years of wishing, her answer has finally arrived with tickets to Caraval, set in a far away island. Whatever youve heard about Caraval, it doesnt compare to the reality. Its more than just a game or performance. Its the closest youll ever find yourself magic in this world. Leaving to go to Caraval means more than the possibility of being part of an extraordinary experience, it means the escape plan they been waiting for their whole lives, but it also comes with a highrisk danger if their father finds them. Even more now than Scarlets arranged marriage is taking place some days after Caraval. But keep in mind, clues are not the only thing you need to win. This game is like a person. If you truly want to play it right, you need to learn its history. But what Scarlett doesnt realize is that running away and getting to Caraval is the easy part. Now Tella has disappeared and is being held as part of the game, and Scarlett has less than 5 days to look for the clues in hopes of finding her sister while trying to keep herself from going mad at the experience Caraval is. Every person has the power to change their fate if they are brave enough to fight for what they desire more than anything. Scarletts character is immensely defined by the abuse she has gone through by her father and her role as big sister. Her being the one playing part in this experience was interesting because she has lost that drive for magic she had as a child and shes quite naive, which in Caraval devious world works as a good contrast. Nonetheless, I felt Scarett to be too clueless most of the time, and I was surprised to how she didnt get swallowed by Caraval in the first day. In the first half of the book, most of her choices seem to always get her to the right place, and even when she did stupid things she got the ImLegendsespecialguest free pass. I did like her better at the end and I definitely enjoyed the fact that I couldnt fully trust anything going on, meaning that if she was right about freaking out about stuff or if it was just her forgetting its supposed to be just a game. She remembered her first impression of him, tall, roughly handsome, and dangerous, like poison dressed up in an attractive bottle. Julian was shady af most of the time. I was suspicious of him through all the book, and maybe because he wasnt good neither bad person in his mysterious ways, I felt him being a more interesting character. I was into his storyline because of his past connection to Caraval and his reasons to play again. I liked him, even when I couldnt trust him completely, and I enjoyed him and Scarlett together. Legend likes to play twisted games with people, and one of his favorites is making girls fall in love with him. I had mixed feelings about Tella, I either thought she was stupid or right with her actions. I enjoyed of her free spirit self, but I was truly surprised at the end to see the depth we were missing about her. But regardless of this, I still hated her a little in some scenes, but I think it was meant to be that way to keep the reader being unable to keep a clear view of anything. Legends character was intriguing. I cant really say much because I dont want to spoil anything, but I really loved him, even when I was confused or disliked him. At the end, you can see how much Legend is like Caraval, deceitful but magical. Scarlett had always seen her own emotions in color, but shed never seen anothers person. The biggest issue I encountered within this book was the over use of metaphorscomparisons. I found myself more than once skipping through paragraphs because I had space out with the metaphors and such. I do feel it gave the book a more distinctive feel, but some of them had no meaning so just didnt work for me. I read, when I was close to the end of the book, that someone refered to it by the main character having synesthesia, which is a perceptual condition of mixed sensations: a stimulus in one sensory modality e.g., hearing involuntarily elicits a sensationexperience in another modality e.g. vision, source. Id see how this would play with the writing style and the character, but I feel the fact that maybe if I had know beforehand I may have not struggled as much as I did. Not quite sure how far shed already fallen, she imagined loving him would feel like falling in love with darkness, frightening and consuming yet utterly beautiful when the stars came out. I had some disconnection to the story until the 50 mark. After that, the plot got A LOT more interesting, unraveling secrets and dark twists. It got more action packed and I just really started to wanting to know everything that was happening. So, just as an advice, if you start this interested but you feel is not that captivating, wait until the middle of the book to make a decision to stop reading. Caraval takes place at night because you like to watch, and see what people do when they think there are no consequences. I had a bunch of theories from the beginning about everything that was happening, and though some of them were correct, I didnt stop enjoying the story. I did felt some explanations werent as believable as they could be, but as a whole book I think it was pretty great and Im excited for part two of this duology. Although it is a duology, this book doesnt have a cliffhanger, just an ending that gives you things to crave for in the next book, so you can go ahead and read this without worrying about a cliffhanger. For me this book was interesting and captivating, the second half redeemed everything that bored me at first, and overall I enjoyed it, so I recommend this one if you want a story that keeps you guessing if youre going mad or not in a magical game, in true Caraval fashion.
Gawd.....I love this series. I love Dawson and Daemon. I love Jennifer. Need to get my thoughts in order....review to come! OKAY, I think I have had enough time to gather my thoughts so I can write my review for this. It wont be as long as my other reviews because I have so much to say but dont want to spoil anything for those that have not gotten to it yet! So here goes..... SO, yay!!! I was so glad to see Daemon and Dee again! Ive especially missed Daemon like SO MUCH!!!!! Ever since I found out there was gonna be a novella about his TWIN brother, I had been itching to get my hands on it!! Boy were my hands itching like CRAZY!!! I was about to go to the doctor for some relief cream or something. But then I thought maybe my doctor would think I needed to see a psychiatrist instead. So, finally my hands stopped itching and all was good with the world. In the beginning we meet Dawson, Daemons other halfsometimes better half, but not really. WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, they are like SO different! Like night and day different. While Daemon is the arrogant prick, Dawson is the sweet and loving guy we all wish Daemon would be! But thats not true. I love Daemon even more after reading this. I mean seriously the things he suffers, OMG, my heart breaks for him!! I just want to jump into the book and hug him. I love his arrogant banteringif thats the correct grammar because he wouldnt be Daemon without it. Eventhough it would be a turn off if a guy pulled that shit in real life. But Daemon can totally tell me off anytime! We also meet Bethany, which okay she is AMAZING!!! Perfect for Dawson in every way imaginable. She is the new girl in school and walks into Dawsons class and its like Hello mama, come sit with me and Ill show you a whole new side of me no one has ever seen before kind of thing. He is instantly drawn to her. I mean, I cant blame him. She is totally hot, sweet, kind and accepting of the most freakiest occurances ever! Of course I would be the same way with those HOT SEXY ALIEN GUYS too!! Damn, they are like electrifying! So, Dawson and Beth hit it off really well. He is the only one who actually talks to her, making her feel less like a loser being the new girl and all. They spend more time together and of course, Daemon and the rest of the Luxen clan are not to keen on the idea. The arum are lurking in the shadows of the small town of Fairfield. Dawson had already killed one in the beginning. So yea, they have a right to be paranoid about it. Not to mention the DOD are on their asses practically stalking them. Its nonsense, leave them alone already!!!! They creep me out!! Well, it takes a little time, but both of the lovesick puppies fall in love. Its so sweet and heartwrenching because we all know what happens!! She knows what he is but is like fascinated by it rather than scared. She reminds me of Katy more and more except she actually handled it better than Katy did, eventhough it was a lot for a human to process. SIGH I want Beth as my best friend!!! tear Even warning Dawson of the dangers, Daemon finally accepts that he has found the love of his life. I can see the pain and fear in Daemon for his brothers safety. Lighting up Bethany on more than one occasion like the Fourth of freaking July as Daemon put it, he still follows his heart!!! UGH, UGH, UGH....Ive finally lost my train of thought. My tears are burning my eyes remembering the scene. Poor Daemon, poor Dee. Oh Dawson......no no no no no no no!!!!! My heart is splattered on the floor! I cant picture this, its too much! My love for Daemon will never falter. Remember how obsessed I was? Geez, my review says it all. And I still feel the same way. But Dawson...oh DAWSON!!! God just his name brings those fluttery butterflies in my tummy!! Once again we see Ash, stupid mean bitch Ash whom I wanted to yank all her hair out!!! That is Katys man, stay off of him!!!!!!!!!!!! wishing he was mine I dont get what Daemon sees in her, maybe just because they are both from the same planet I guess. Also, I did not like Andrew either. He was an ass. But wow, Adam.....he totally made me swoon when he stuck up for Dawson!!! Hell yes, Adam!!! You can rock my world too, theres plenty of me to go around baby!!!!! This book was riveting, compelling, mesmerizing, sexy, romantic, heartbreaking, sad, happy, suspenseful, page turning......EVERYTHING a YA book should beeven for a novella!! It was the best novella Ive read! I want more!! The ending left me cryingreal tears. I finished it in like 4 days because I couldnt bare the ending yet. All of my friends finished it before me because I was such a puss!! I knew what was coming! I had to brace myself and then take the plunge head on....it still didnt soften the blow though. UGH, UGH, UGH.......I hate having to wait for Onyx....and even worse since we have to wait 3 months more than originally planned!!! NO NO NO NO NO.....how will I survive this monstrosity!!!!!! I recommend reading this after Obsidian and I am glad I did because I understand everything better plus, it just makes sense to read Obsidian first!!! Oh Daemon. Oh Dee. Oh Dawson. Oh my heart. The end.
ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review Blindsided. Thats the best explanation for the stern volume of my voice and tightness in my usuallycomposed expression. I wasnt prepared for this . Not for a tall, voluptuous , sexybeyondallreason woman to walk into my classroom. My first thought?  Pam Godwin has hit every sinful note in this seductive, forbidden, bewitching and utterly addicting romance. Ms. Godwin has composed a story that was layered with intrigue, steam, passion and erotic BDSM undertones in her newest release, Dark Notes. Right off the opening pages, I was consumed and mesmerized by Ms. Godwins lyrical and poetic prose. She not only hypnotize me to feel for her characters but she held me hostage. Though this book was layered with erotic undertones, Ms. Godwin does an excellent job balancing this. She draws her readers to feel, listen and understand the strong magnetic pull as to why lines were crossed and blurred. Ivory. That conjures an image of paleness with hard, worn edges like piano keys or teeth. Doesnt fit her at all. Shes a dark portrait of soft curves and chestnut hair with deep golden skin that seems to absorb shadows in the room I hadnt noticed until now.  Ivory Westbrook is a pianist prodigy. She is gifted, smart, beautiful, and talented. She is a survivor and strongwilled. Her musical talent has landed her in a prestigious performing art high school and her goal is to further that dream to play by getting accepted to a well known performing arts college in New York. Ivory has made it her mission. This is her dream. He seems untouchable. Maybe his fists are as brutal as his beauty. Just looking at him feels like Im inhaling a lungful of fire. While Ivory is gifted musically, her home life is a mess. After her father passed away, her mother and elder brother went on a downward spiral. They both treat her like she is nobody, worthless slut and blames Ivory that they have no money because her father sold his piano bar so Ivory could attend this prestigious high school. They blame Ivory for everything. Though Ivory could easily walk away from them, she doesnt. A part of her cares and loves for them. And so Ivory does what she needs to do in order to survive. She sells her body to willing high school boys in exchange to put food on the table, keep the house that they are living in and pay all the necessary bills in order to survive. To give her body so freely was not her first choice, since Ivorys innocence was stolen from her at a young age of 13 at the hands of her brothers best friend who was nine years her senior. What Ivory lacked in money, she was rich in talent. I wouldnt need words, just her awareness of my body, my intent, and my confidence to give her what she craves. She may not know it but she needs clearlydefined boundaries, discipline, and a man she can trust to push her beyond her comfort zone. She may not yet recognize me as that man, but she will. On her first day of senior year, Ivory knows what everyone thinks of her. She is a slut. A nobody. Worthless. But luckily for Ivory, she has at least one friend in school that she can count on but mostly Ivory keeps to herself. She knows that in order to pursue her dreams, she needs to work hard. So when Ivory meets her new teacher, Emeric Marceaux, she feels an instant gravitational pull to him. When Emeric first meets Ivory, he is enchanted by her beauty, smart mouth, and feisty personality. He is drawn to her. She was like a siren, calling him forth. Emeric is well aware, that he cant have her. Shes far too young and his student. Its forbidden and frown upon. But Emeric soon finds himself consumed by her and his need to protect her from the family and boys who takes advantages of her. Shes made for me, to be instructed and punished and enjoyed. I want inside her with such agonizing intensity my body quakes. I want in her mouth, her cunt, and her soul. I want to rip her apart with my shaft, piece her back together, and do it all over again. Fuck, I need this girl. And I cant have her. Like a moth to a flame, Emeric and Ivory are enraptured with one another. For the first time in a very long time, Ivory wants what Emeric is willing to offer. He is her teacher, master, and soon becomes her lover. Lines were crossed. The teacherstudent relationship gets blurred when they both enter a secret relationship. And soon Ivory discovers Emerics sexual needs, wants, and desires. His need to own her body, mind, and soul. As Emeric and Ivory continue their secret sexual relationships, they are aware that they must take caution of their love affair. While Emeric could lose his job, he doesnt want Ivory to lose her opportunity in pursuing her dreams in attending that prestigious performing arts university. And so Emeric take precautionary measures to ensure that all his tracks are taken care of. But what happens when their secret is exposed? How far will Emeric go to protect Ivory? Will everything Ivory wanted and dreamed of be destroyed? Can their love prevail? Dark Notes had everything that I hoped for and so much more in a studentteacher romance trope. This book had incorporated so much depth, vulnerability, raw emotions, sensuality, and dark erotic layers that it spotlighted what it truly meant to love. The story of Ivory and Emeric captures every essence of truth, loyalty, sacrifice and undying love. I loved that Pam Godwin didnt make this your standard forbidden trope, but she made readers understand the motivation of Ivory and Emeric. They are far from perfect but together their love was perfect. It was real. There were no lies and misgivings. Its honest. Imperfect. Sensual. Seductive. It was LOVE. Thats when I hear it. The tempo of our breaths. The drum of our heartbeats. The crackle in the air. The exquisite cadence pulses through me, awakening sensations Ive never felt, composing a melody Ive never heard. Our hypnotic, dark notes. This book hit every high note. The love of Emeric and Ivory is a beautiful melody that will resound to every romance book aficionado. This book was indeed like a well composed masterpiece. It started off with a melody that will entice and seduce readers then slowly Pam Godwin masterfully bewitches readers to feel the music, the story, the love that is blooming between her characters and of course, she ends her masterpiece with a dramatic flare that will make readers want to reread this book again. So if you are looking for a story that paints a beautiful literary tale of love, sensuality and seduction then I highly recommend you to read this book. Pam did an amazing job in capturing a beautiful love story with her poetic prose. Review can also be found on Four Chicks Flipping Pages:  Godwin
What is infinite? The universe and the greed of men. I really, really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it and thats all I really ask for from a book like this. Leigh Bardugo was great at developing her world, I felt like it was real as she had worked out how social interactions occurred, how the government worked and also added in some history. Yet something about her prose of writing just didnt really connect with me on a deep level. Thats really the only reason I didnt give this book 5 stars. I felt like Bardugos writing was always on the surface and never went deep enough for me personally. But dont get me wrong, I still appreciated Bardugos writing, which was in some points quite beautiful. It is because I love him that I will not let him put himself beyone redemption. My favorite part of this book was the Darkling. I do not necessarily like him, but I sure do find him interesting. I found myself quickly turning pages just to get more insight into him as a character. It was disappointing that we never got much of an insight, but I remember this is a first of three books. If I get a good insight into his past and feel like I know him on a deep level by the end of the series, I will be very pleased. Sometimes I wish this book was told from his perspective. I do really love and respect Alinas character, but I find the Darkling is so unique and intriguing that to be able to see the world through his eyes and understand his thoughts would be a lot more interesting. I wonder sometimes how much we really understand our own gifts. The Darkling was definitely the highlight of this book for me, and a huge part of why I enjoyed it so much. I like when I read a book and think ill never read anything very similar to this again and thats how I feel about the Darkling. I think what really helped make this story interesting was that there was a lot of external plot to keep the story moving. I never felt like Alina had much control over where the story went, which I really like when reading. It makes it feel like there is an actual story going on outside of the characters. And theres nothing wrong with being a lizard either. Unless you were born to be a hawk. There was action at appropriate times and I often felt suspense and worry. The story only felt flat towards the middle of the book, although I was never bored. I also liked that a lot was always happening and I never felt like scenes were dragging on for too long. It was sharp and to the point, without wasting time on pointless scenes or dialogue. I think this was really influenced by Bardugos great understanding of her own world and her creativity. She always had new ideas to place into the plot so that it never got stagnant. I personally felt like this was a very well planned and structured story. I want to comment on Mal. I quite liked how his character was set up at the beginning of the book. His relationship at the orphanage with Alina was set up really nicely with a lot of imagery. It set up this sad but sweet childhood relationship. The way he behaved whilst being in the army was also interesting. But the second half of the book I felt like he fell into the trap of a typical male love interest. I found his character and relationship with Alina honestly typical. It felt deep at the beginning, but those feelings I had just sort of faded when it got a bit too cliche for me. His dialogue felt very scripted and hard to believe. Now this may have occurred because I found the connection Alina had with the Darkling fascinating. I never really knew if it was chemistry or some deeper form of connection that was enforced due to their powers. I liked feeling clueless and left guessing. I guess since this relationship was so unique, the idea of Alina and Mal just felt exaggeratedly typical next to it. I think because this book had such an interesting story I was not too invested in the romance and overall, this did not really bother me. Its rare for me to not really care who the leading female ends up with in the end, thats usually my biggest concern. I love Alina as a character and am just really interested in her finding her own inner peace and using her powers to the best of her abilities. This was what I had been born for. I would never let anyone separate me from it again. I think it was Alinas humble, down to earth personality that I loved. I liked that she was able to accept her own faults, was honest with herself and was kind but mature to those around her, with a little quirk and sarcasm here and there. Lastly I would like to comment on my other favorite part of this book. I liked how this book centered around the idea of belonging to someone and feeling like you have a place in the world. Alinas feelings of loneliness, isolation and desperation to belong somewhere were actually quite relateable. In an individualistic society, it is quite easy to feel isolated and unwanted, and the idea of pleasing and belonging to someone, particularly someone powerful and attractive, is unfortunately somehow comforting. So for a book to touch on something like this, that people often experience in our world, was a personally moving thing to read about. It gave this story depth and a purpose behind the story itself. As I said, if I had connected on a deeper level with Bardugos writing style, I would have given this book 5 stars. In this genre of young adult fiction, this is one of the best Ive read so far and cannot wait to pick up the sequel! The problem with wanting... is that it makes us weak.
The universe owes you nothing, Kady. It has already given you everything, after all. It was here long before you, and it will go on long after you. The only way it will remember you is to do something worth remembrance. This book took my heart and shattered it into a thousand pieces. I was an incoherent mess after finishing and, a day later, I still dont know what to do with myself. This is just a phenomenal book and perhaps one of the easiest five star reviews Ive ever given. You have no idea what youre missing out on if you havent read this yet! In all honesty, I didnt think Id like this at first. I was so hesitant to pick this book up because of the format. I thought  due to it being told through a dossier  that Id have no connection with the characters. Boy, could I not have been more wrong. I was somehow even more invested in these little shits. Which was, in retrospect, a bad idea due to the fact that so many people die. Theyre so full of determination and humour and a primal need to do whatever it takes to survive. I havent been this in love with a group of characters since ACOMAF. During the first 85 pages I was confused as hell. I think this is because Im not a huge scifi reader, and this world was just full of so many technical terms that I couldnt understand at first. I was considering giving up during those pages. Im so glad I didnt, though, because once I got passed them I was swept into a whirlwind of love and death and pain. My heart was constantly pounding in my throat as I clawed my way through this book. Ive never really felt such a vast array of feelings like this all at once! I think that, about half way through this book, I actually had an existential crisis. Illuminae was just such a beautiful collective of thoughts and emotions. Ive never read anything quite like it, and I dont think I ever will again. Miracles are statistical improbabilities. And fate is an illusion humanity uses to comfort itself in the dark. There are no absolutes in life, save death. Writing: The atmosphere of this book was astounding. Youll find that there are just so many quotable moments, especially towards the end. The way that Kaufman and Kristoff could blend humour and terror and hope all once was beautiful. I think they really got down to the core of what makes us human, and not many authors can do that in a way that really registers with a reader. These authors are just brilliant and I need all their other work right this second. I spent a lot of this book welling up, but when I got towards the end I was weeping like a baby. This novel is just so full of love and loss and hope and despair. I never thought a book that was told through a series of reports, IM chats, emails, and data logs could fill me with so many emotions, but it did. Every time I turned a page, something happened that threw everything I thought I knew out of orbit. I was constantly on my toes with my guard up but somehow, no matter how hard I tried to prepare myself, I never seemed to see anything coming. Honestly, Ive never had so much anxiety in my life. I also need to throw out a mention to the virus that was, for a lack of better words, fucking terrifying. It reminded me of intelligent zombies in a way. The way that the infected slowly lost themselves to madness was horrifying. BioTech did a seriously good job at creating a virus that could easily wipe out humanity. Stunning job, guys. I should have told you I loved you every day. I should have given you the stars. Characters: I honestly have no idea how they managed to do it, but the authors made me get attached to every character in this novel. I cried when they cried, I loved when they loved, and, when some of them died, a part of me died with them. Their development was done to perfection and they so often felt like real people to me. It wasnt just the main cast, either. There were a whole host of other characters who I loved and cherished. James, Dorian, Zhang, and so many more. The secondary characters really added a spark to this novel that I cant really explain. I just loved them all and, of course, had my heart broken because of it. Kady: My beautiful astroprincess. Kady is fierce, headstrong, intelligent, and has a strong sense of right and wrong. I think the book, especially towards the end, focuses on her humanity and her willingness to do anything to allow the people around her a chance to survive. She doesnt know the meaning of the word quit and I love her so much for that. She was, however, by no means perfect. She could be both selfish and selfless. She could be both loving and cold. She sometimes made decisions that were questionable at best but, given her situation, it was easy to understand her reasoning. The way her character loses so much and still manages to stand on her feet and fight until the bitter end really resonated with something inside of me. I want, with all my heart, to be like Kady. Ezra: Then theres my cinnamon roll. Ezra was sweet, kind, and hopelessly loyal. His unwavering love for Kady was one of the things I enjoyed the most about him. The banter and love that Ezra and Kady share was perhaps one of my favourite things about this novel. His dry humour was just brilliant and really help bring light into an otherwise dark novel. Everyone needs an Ezra in their life. AIDAN: What the hell, AIDAN. You cant just make me feel for you. Youre not even a human! AIDAN is the Artifical Intelligence system of the Alexander who somehow manages to become a character of its own. Its one duty is to prioritise and protect the fleet by whatever means necessary and, of course, thats where things go wrong. Once AIDAN meets Kady its mind begins to change and it suddenly finds itself able to think on its own. Its hatred for the fact that it could think and feel and yet wasnt human honestly broke my heart. As I said in my original review, its an Artificial Intelligence Network who comes down with a case of feelings. I actually found that, out of all the characters, I liked AIDAN the best. Which, after everything it does, was so surprising. I know most people hated AIDAN straight away, but I just couldnt. I think Ive always had a sense of ruthlessness, and I could understand what AIDAN was trying to do. AIDAN wanted to save as many people as it could and, lets face it, without his actions I think the ending would have seen absolutely no survivors. Plus, his sarcasm in the face of death was just brilliant. We all need sassy, insane AIs in our lives. WHEN I FOUND OUT IT WAS STILL FUNCTIONAL I WAS CRYING TEARS OF JOY! Are you afraid? Yes. Energy never stops, remember. It just changes forms. I am still afraid. And that, ladies and gentlemen, was the moment I started blubbering like a child. You have me. Until ever last star in the galaxy dies. You have me. Overall Everyone needs Illuminae in their lives. I know that there is a large amount of hype surrounding it, but I promise that its all entirely justified. Illuminae surprised me in the best of ways and I cant recommend a book more. It deserves more than five stars, I can tell you that. If youre afraid of it being difficult to read because of the format, dont be. Once you get used to the pattern and feel of the novel, youll find it impossible to put this book down. Thank you Yarravy for recommending me another beautiful book! Guess who wants to be a hacker now? Perhaps bravery is simply the face humanity wraps around its collective madness.
Full review and giveaway here:  PEPPER  MICHELLES JOINT REVIEW Disclaimer: We are obsessed with this book. We will try to make this review have some actual substance but there will probably be a lot of gushing and word vomit. Sorry. Its just that good. MICHELLE: I honestly think that this is the best book I have ever read. It is definitely the best book in the world of romance that I have read. And there are a lot of books that I love A LOT. But this book if I gave out stars, I would give Archers Voice all the stars and throw in a few planets. Its so fucking good. I cant stand it. Like I just want to read it every day for the rest of my life til I die and never read anything else ever again. Not exaggerating. PEPPER: Yes. There really is no way possible to make sense of how to rate this book. But like you said, it is  Definitely. By far. Easily. The best romance novel I have ever read. Hands down. MICHELLE: I have loved everything that Mia Sheridan has written so far I can admit that much. But this book. This hero. This takes loving a book to a whole different level. I LIVED this book. It was beyond anything I had ever experienced in my past reading. Archer will change everything you think you know about a book boyfriend. PEPPER: I know. And I cant even put Archer into book boyfriend category. He needs his own category. This entire book does. Its like an experience. And Ill be honest. I am not the type of person to be all flowery and touchyfeely about books. They are either really good or they arent. What happened to me when I read this book has pretty much never happened when I have read a book. Like, Ive gotten choked up before in books, or my heart races, or I may have spilled a few tears. But I was, like you said, LIVING this book. I know we talk about crying with books sometimes and how things can get a little crazy with our emotions. But after I read this I was giving the husband the low down on Archer and all things Mia Sheridan. And I just started bawling uncontrollably. And this is not normal. I literally had a melt down after this book. I was crying so hard that I was hiccuping and the hubs was like, Hey, you havent missed any prozac doses have you? I was a hot mess, like: MICHELLE: LOL. I totally get it. I was all over the place with my emotions. There is a moment in this book where I am pretty sure my heart stopped. I actually gasped, grabbed my chest and had to stop for while. I was like: Now, Mia, you know I love you but that was downright dirty what you did. And you know what I am talking about woman. PEPPER: OH MY GOD. I know. Remember my text? And the same thing happened to our best friend of the program too. At the exact same spot. It was awful. But how could we not forgive Mia after this thing of beauty? MICHELLE: I know. Its true. We still love our bestie. We will never stop. So beyond Archer as if there is anything really beyond Archer you have Bree. I love Bree. Not just because she is strong and just wonderful in general. I think on her own she is a totally likeable character. But I actually think I love her because of how she is with Archer. This book is so well written that there are times where I feel like I am spying on a real life couple. Bree is an easy character to love and you are just right there with her as she navigates getting to know Archer in every way. And then you see Archer through her eyes and you fall in love. Right there. It happens. And the way he loves her back., the way they love each other. I cant handle how beautiful it is. The things they say to each other made my heart actually ache. PEPPER: YES!! Although Archer is basically a god of some kind, without Bree this book would not have been as amazing as it was. I definitely dont want to leave her out. Because without her, we wouldnt really be able to see Archer or experience him the way we do. Everyone else ignores him. And thats what makes HER so beautiful. Her unbridled compassion and lust and intrigue for him. Its everything. MICHELLE: Its perfect. Bree is the perfect person for Archer and her ability to let us see Archer for what he is amazes me. I have to remind myself that these are characters in a book. But then they go off and say things like this: I love you so much it hurts... Im afraid to love you. Im afraid that youll leave and that Ill go back to being alone again. Only it will be a hundred times worse because Ill know what Im missing. I cant... He sucked in a shaky breath.  I want to be able to love you more than I fear losing you, and I dont know how. Teach me, Bree. Please teach me. Dont let me destroy this. Died. Died. PEPPER: God. Its everything. The love they have for each other amazing. Unlike anything I have ever read. 90 of the time we see couples playing hard to get until the bitter end. And we dont mind that. Because we dig the angst! But dammit if it wasnt perfection the way they had a relationship. Normally I would be like, Jesus, calm down girllike when she runs to him and jumps in his arms in public but you are right there with her screaming like a crazy person. Like: And as sweet as Archer is, Bree has her moments. You feel her love in her words like when she calls Archer: my wounded healer, my beautiful Archer. MICHELLE: God yes. Swoon. So, in case you were wondering, there are other characters in this book as well. Some you will love and some you will hate, probably more than you have ever hated anyone ever in a book. Ever. PEPPER: OH MY GOD How could I forget about that mother fucking asshole character?! We will avoid saying names, but I had a visceral reaction toward at least one person in this book. It was insane how pissed I was. MICHELLE: I agree. We will leave names out but just know that there is someone that we hated so much. They werent a traditional villian but this person was such a vile human being. Ugh. I honestly feel like no review can do this book justice. I dont know if we are convincing you of how amazing Archer and Bree are together. But this love that they have its unlike anything I have ever read or even experienced. This is what I imagine a real true love to be like. Love so strong and so real that it is actually painful.  There has only ever been you. There. Will. Only. Ever. Be. You. Archer PEPPER: I just cant. When he says stuff like that, and he says it a lot Im just done. Done. Like I feel at a loss because you are right, there is nothing  even Mia Sheridan herself  can say to make a review of this book truly get the point across. Like you basically just need to stop reading our word vomit and get this book. Because you havent lived or experienced anything like it. So you will just be missing out. MICHELLE: Mia Sheridan has already solidified her place in my heart as one of my favorite writers when she wrote Leo, Leos Chance and Stinger. But she just blew everyone our of the water with this. Archer is a different type of character that you have to experience yourself. But the way Mia writes him is damn beautiful I just cant stand it. PEPPER: Go and get this book. And have a brand new reading experience that we promise you have never had. Thats about all I can say. I dont know what else to do. Or say. Like my husband wants to read it because I havent shut up about it for days. Just do me a favor and get the damn book. Thank you. MICHELLE: Agreed. We promise you, you will never regret reading this book. It is beyond anything you have ever read or experienced. PEPPER: PS. Hey Mia  We Mia you!!
Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales. Quick  Dirty: Awesome YA Paranormal packed with action, intriguing characters, and hot forbidden romance. Opening Sentence: My eyes snapped open as the freakish sixth sense kicked my fight or flight response into overdrive. The Review: Alex is a halfblood, she is part human and part Hematoi. Three years ago she attended a school to become a Sentinel called The Covenant. A Sentinel is a guard that helps protect full blooded Hematoi from the Daimons. Daimons are creatures that suck the aether out of pure and half blood Hematoi. They can also turn pure bloods into Daimons as well but so far they have never turned a half blood. But three years ago Alexs pure blooded mother decided it was no longer safe for Alex to become a Sentinel and they run away into the human world, and she never told Alex why. Recently the Damions found Alex and her mother and her mother didnt make it out alive. Lucky for Alex she was saved by some Sentinels sent by the Covenant. Now Alex has returned to Deity Island where many Pures and Halfbloods live. She wants to restart school but unfortunately she is really behind on training and most people feel that there is no way to catch up. For halfbloods there are only two types of professions that you can have  a guardsentinel or a servant. If you become a servant you are given an elixir that makes you a vacant person. It pretty much puts you on a high that you never come down from, but it makes you a very compliant servant. Alex has had nightmares about being put into servitude and now it looks as if she has no other choice. Fortunately for Alex some people believe that she has too much natural talent and putting her in servitude would be a waste. One person in particular is Aiden St. Delphi, he is a pure Sentinel. He offers to help train Alex so she will be ready when the school starts in the fall. Alex needs to train hard and learn to deal with what happened to her mother. Also some people have a different agenda for Alexs life and she might not have much to say in her future as she would like. Alex is a great character. She is very independent and has lots of attitude. I will admit that at times she has a very immature streak that can be a little frustrating. She is very impulsive and tends to act before she thinks at times. Despite her flaws she is an awesome character that I really connected with. She is a very determined person and she goes after what she wants. She develops a huge crush on her very hot instructor Aiden, but he is a Pure Blood. Relationships between Pures and Halves is strictly forbidden, but Alex cant help the connection she feels with Aiden. Aiden St. Delphi is one of those dream boys. He has a rocking body; hes gorgeous, kind, caring and all around pretty much perfect. Unfortunately, he is also very off limits. When he was a young man his parents were killed by Daimons, and it forced him to grow up faster than most. He raised his younger brother and became a Sentinel. Most Pures leave Sentinel work up to the Halves, but Aiden needed revenge for what happened to his parents and he wanted nothing more than to kill Daimons the rest of his life. When he meets Alex he feels that she has so much potential and he offers to help train her. It is pretty obvious that he is attracted to Alex. Aiden is a decent guy and he tries to rein in his feelings because if he doesnt Alex will pay the consequences. So WOW  I have to fangirl a little bit. Jennifer Armentrout is probably my favorite author right now. I have read pretty much every book she has written and all of them have been amazing. HalfBlood is no exception, it is a great read. I love how Jennifer writes her stories  they always have lots of action, romance, and great characters. She does tend to end her books with a cliffhanger which can be frustrating, but the wait for the next book is always worth it. I love Alexs story and I am excited to see what happens next. So if you havent read anything by Jennifer yet, I highly recommend you start like right now. As for the Covenant series, I would recommend it to anyone that likes YA Paranormal. I dont think it will disappoint you. Notable Scene: His brows rose. Now youre starting to upset me. Thats two of us youve killed. You keeping a tally or something? My heart stopped when the floor behind me creaked. I whirled around, spotting a female daimon. She inched closer, forcing me toward the other daimon. They were caging me in, giving me no opportunity to escape. Another one shrieked somewhere is the pile of crap. Panic and fear choked me. My stomach rolled violently as my fingers trembled around the garden spade. Gods, I wanted to puke. The ringleader advanced on my. Do you know what Im going to do to you? I swallowed and fixed a smirk on my face. Blah. Blah. Youre gonna kill me. Blah. I know. The females ravenous shriek cut off his response. Obviously, she was very hungry. She circled me like a vulture, ready to rip into me. My eyes narrowed on her. The hungry ones were always the stupidestthe weakest of the bunch. Legend said it was the first taste of aetherthe very life force running through our bloodthat possessed a pureblood. A single taste turned one into a daimon and resulted in a lifetime of addiction. There was a good chance I could get past her. The other one... well, he was a different story. FTC Advisory: Spencer Hill Press provided me with a copy of HalfBlood. No goody bags, sponsorships, material connections, or bribes were exchanged for my review.
Beatrice Prior was born into a faction that required selflessness. One that required putting the needs of others in front of her own. One that demanded silence when she would have rather spoken and inaction when she would rather have taken it. But being part of one faction didnt mean staying a part of it. And at sixteen, the choice would be hers. Remain with her family and the faction she was born into, or leave them all behind and embrace something new. And while Beatrice wasnt selfish, shed never really fit into her familys faction, and she knew shed never be able to always put others first. So she chose. To leave her home. To say goodbye to her family. To take the risk that her new faction might not be the right one. And to face the very real possibility that she could become factionless if she failed the initiation. Or that she just might not even survive.  Divergent is the incredibly imaginative, beautifully written and completely captivating first book in author Veronica Roths new series set in a dystopian Chicago. Filled with heartstopping action, danger and suspense from cover to cover, it is unputdownable. This story immediately grabs, introducing readers to this society which separates itself from the outside world and further divides itself up into five very different factions of likeminded people  Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. The hope is to create balance, equality and keep the peace. The reality is something much different. As the main character, Beatrice Prior, reinvents herself as Tris and tries to fit into her new world, she quickly learns that just because she wants a new start doesnt mean that shes ready to let go of everything from her past. And that being a part of it doesnt mean she has to. But if she thought that choosing her new faction and leaving her family behind would be her toughest challenge, shed have been wrong. Because choosing a faction offered no guarantee shed become a part of it. And with a limited number of initiates who pass, the competition is fierce. Deadly even. Even more so for her. Because Tris has a secret. A secret she must keep hidden as she faces each round of the initiation. A secret she cant reveal, not even to the boy who seems familiar to her, who seems to know her better than anyone and who seems to be on her side. Because the secret shes keeping is dangerous. And the price shed pay for its discovery could be her life. Author Veronica Roth has created an utterly riveting start to this series in Divergent. For a book that is nearly five hundred pages, the pace is lightning fast. The action is nonstop, the characters are easy to connect with, the society is as intriguing as it is disturbing, and the plot propels readers further and further into its depths. For fans of books with a strong, likable and relatable heroine, an exciting, dangerfilled and actionpacked plot, a society on the verge of upheaval and a hero with secrets of his own who is fascinating and mysterious, then Divergent is an absolute must read. On a personal note: What an unbelievably amazing book this was. I expected something so totally different than what it actually was. I imagined it would be this cold, clinical dystopian society. Something that felt very alien and difficult for me to connect with. Its why it took so long for me to start reading it, even though it caught my eye over a year ago. I thought the idea was absolutely intriguing, but thought that I couldnt fall in love with a story that hinted of societal unrest and talked of warring factions and initiations. And I never imagined I could ever like, let alone love, a boy named after a number. Oh how wrong I was. This story was so enchanting and it was just so easy to get caught up in this world. From the second I read the first paragraph I was hooked. I could not stop reading it, until I was forced to. And the second I could return to the story I did. I couldnt wait to get back into this world, to see just what Tris would be faced with next. And to learn all I could about this mysterious boy, Four. I fell in love with the characters almost instantly after meeting them. Well, the lovable ones anyway. Tris especially. Four, definitely. But it was Tris I connected with the most. As much as I loved Four, it was nice to see a heroine be the strong one, to be the amazing one. I found myself sighing, a lot, when reading the scenes with Tris and Four. I found myself tearing up when certain heartbreaking events came to pass. I did not expect to be so emotionally connected to this story. But I was. This story felt so incredibly real. Which is not typical of a dystopian, for me. The characters, too, felt very real. The sacrifices made, the loses endured and the issues they faced were believable and scary and chilling, but true to life and refreshingly realistic. I loved the fact that Triss friends werent instafriends. That they did turn against her and werent always in her corner. That they felt jealous and selfish and petty and envious. And I loved that the relationship between Tris and Four was also not an immediate one.... I wont talk any more about what I love about the two of them, because that paragraph would be a complete spoiler. While there were a few guesses that I made correctly, there were a few unexpected surprises. The biggest of course being how much I loved this book. And now, along with the rest of the universe, I am dying to read the next one. I cannot wait to find out where this series is headed. Though the title of the next book gives me some idea. I am almost glad I waited until now to read this first book, because the wait until Insurgent is so much shorter. I feel kind of lucky, actually. One thing is certain, though. I will not be waiting seven months to read Insurgent. I read Divergent ten days ago and I already miss Tris and Four. That sequel will be read on release date. No question.  I have a favorite passage. Its actually an amazing quote by Four. But because I think its best discovered in context, I will not reveal it here. There are so many beautiful passages that made me sigh, but as I can only reveal one here, I choose... I have only one memory of getting here, and even that is just a single image: black ink curling around the side of a neck, the corner of a tattoo, and the gentle sway that could only mean he was carrying me.
Orignally reviewed on my blog A Blonde Librarian Tense, moving and beautiful. I fell in love with Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children. Do you ever have a book sat on your TBR pile for so long that when you finally pick it up, you wonder to yourself, why did I not read this sooner?. That is exactly the reaction I had after reading Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs. The book focuses on Jacob, who has grown up listening to his Grandfathers stories. Stories of a troubled childhood, running from monsters, and finding refuge in a special place for others just like him. Jacob used to love the stories, but as he grew older, he realised that they were just the ramblings of a Grandfather to his Grandson, made up stories from a mind that was beginning to decay. Jacob musters on with school, his job at the family business, and just daytoday life.....until a tragedy occurs that suddenly makes Jacob believe everything his Grandfather told him. Convinced that the stories were true, Jacob sets off on a journey of discovery to find this strange childrens home that his Grandfather spoke so fondly of. On a small island in Wales, he finds all of the answers...and a thousand more questions. Jacob finds Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children, and sees just how much he didnt know about his Grandfather...and perhaps himself. As he discovers this magical world, Jacob realises just how much danger he is in. The monsters are real, and he might be the only one who can save everyone. I had heard alot of mixed things about this book. Some people raved about how much they enjoyed it, others couldnt help but express their disappointment. The main reason I gathered for this was that they expected it to be super creepy...and it kind of isnt. I decided to pick this up with no expectations, and that made my reading experience SO much better. I wasnt trying to make this book be something else, I was letting it be what it was, and appreciating it for that. There are so many reasons why I love this book, but I will start on the setting. A small portion of the story takes place in America, but the majority is set on a little misty island in Wales. I love Wales. I spent alot of my childhood there and it holds so many fond memories for me. It was a huge bonus for me that the story took place in one of my favourite places in the world. The writing was great. It flowed perfectly, the descriptions were beautiful. I could imagine every single thing in my mind, from settings to characters, everything was described perfectly. The story was so tense, moving, poignant and sad, but also funny in all the right places, and spooky exactly where I needed it to be. Ransom Riggs writing style is one of the best I have come across in a long time. For me, the writing was flawless. Bear in mind that this is not the most actionpacked of books in places. The first half can be described as slow, but not boring. I read at a leisurely pace, and my interest was definitely kept, but its not until the second half of the book that things really pick up. The last 7080 pages will completely grip you and have you sat on the edge of your seat until the final page. The climax of the story is amazing, and I read the entire second half of this book in just one day, picking it up at every little spare minute I had. The mystery surrounding Jacobs Grandfather, the peculiars, the monsters etc kept me hooked and I was dying to know more! The vintage found photographs scattered throughout the pages are an amazing inclusion. I love how each picture is woven into the story and it added something very special to the whole experience of reading this book. Some of the photos actually freaked me out a little and made me wonder how exactly such weird things came to be taken? The design of the book in general is beautiful. From chapter headers, page footers, page layout and more...the attention to detail is fantastic. I really loved the characters in this book  they were so welldeveloped. Jacob is relatable and believable, which is SO important for a main character. He goes on such an incredible personal journey throughout the story and I really liked him alot. Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children are just freaking awesome!! Each one has their own personality and quirks. Their banter had me laughing on more than one occasion, and I absolutely adored their loyalty to eachother, and to Miss Peregrine. I cannot pick a favourite, I love them all equally in different ways. As for the monsters, they did creep me out a little, but it was more the wights that really did give me the heebie jeebies. Like....really! I dont like them, they scare me. As this is part of a series, the story was not completely wrapped up at the end, but I felt like it ended at just the right place for the time being. ALOT is left open for the sequel and the way it ends really makes you want to pick up the next book. The perfect setup. I only had one tiny little issue with the story. Riggs has created such a unique and complex world with the peculiars and everything, that it can be difficult to understand at times. Certain parts felt almost like an infodump, as Jacob was loaded with complicated explanations. A few times I had to reread those parts to get my head around things a bit better, but I love the world that was created and I cant wait to learn even more about it. Overall, I really did enjoy this book. It was moving, touching, gripping, mysterious, creepy, funny, and just a beautiful, beautiful book to read. Although I had a little issue with it, its nowhere near enough to be a problem, so I am most definitely giving this book full marks. I will definitely be picking up Hollow City which is the sequel to this book ASAP!! I honestly do recommend this, but please dont go into it expecting a spookfest, because thats not what this is. Although some parts are creepy, the bulk of the story is so much more than that, and you will be disappointed if you think this is a horror book. If you have read this, pop on over to my Discussion Post, to have a chitter chatter more indepth about the story and what we all thought. DONT go there if you havent read it. There will be spoilers...dont say I didnt warn you. Hope to see you all over there :
Once again, Taylor Jenkins Reid delivers an emotional and unique story although the story of famous Hollywood star Evelyn Hugo is completely unlike anything that Reid has written before, and I say that as a compliment. If possible, her writing has only gotten better, and she has completely outdone herself with The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Oh yes, this novel is much more complex, more carefully crafted, the narrative richer, and the twists and turns so intricate that they are like a finely woven pattern. And of course there is the drama and emotion one can always expect in a Reid novel, and it is so beautifully done in Evelyn Hugo that it is breathtakingly beautiful. And as always, when I read a Reid novel, I cried more times than I care to admit, but she has that ability to know exactly where to make the reader feel such depth of emotions you cannot help but admire her for knowing exactly how to draw you in and make you so connected to every part of the story and the characters. What can I say about the phenomenal and legendary Hollywood actress Evelyn Hugo?! She appears so vividly real you almost believe you are reading about a living, classic Hollywood star instead of a fictional character! Evelyn literally could have been pulled off the cover of a magazine cover as real as Reid characterized her; it was pure perfection by Reid! Im a fan of old movies from the 50s and 60s and in my minds eye, I visualized a lush and sensuous blend of Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and Elizabeth Taylor for Evelyns gorgeous looks. But, Evelyn is much more than her beauty although she used her looks for advantage throughout her life anytime she wanted to achieve personal success. Oh, no! She is an extremely smart, powerful woman, and that as much as her beauty is how she made it as an Alister in Hollywood! But, for all her beauty, wealth, and fame, Evelyn is in no way perfect. In fact, she really isnt that nice of a person; I would call her a narcissist. She left plenty of scandals, affairs, and backstabbing in her wake during the 50s in Hollywood as she climbed her way to the pinnacle of fame that lasted well into the 80s, and she didnt really look back. Along with her fame, came heartache and pain, not only her own but for many of those who shared her life. Including her seven husbands. It is her decision to suddenly share her stories of her rise to fame in Hollywood and her deepest secrets that lead her to grant her first interview in decades. There is one stipulation though; she will only give the interview to Monique Grant, a junior magazine reporter, which seems so odd at the time. Not only that but when she meets Monique, Evelyn makes it very clear that she is not offering an interview at all, but wants Monique to write a tellall book of her entire lifes storya once in a lifetime opportunity that Evelyn only offers Monique or it will never be written. Of course, Monique takes her up on the offer to write the book since her own life is at an emotional crossroads although she does question why she is chosen to tell the story. Indeed, that same question stays with you throughout the book! You immediately wonder, why Monique? Why did Evelyn pick a relatively unknown journalist to interview her when she could pick any journalist in the world? Ill tell you I had some wild ideas about why Monique was chosen, all of which were so wrong! So, when the real reason comes out towards the end of the book, I was quite shocked! As was Monique! When Monique interviews Evelyn, Evelyn shares details about her terrible childhood, the horrible things she had to do to make her break in sexist, 50s Hollywood, many of the lies she has told over the years, and shares intimate and sometimes very disturbing details about each of the relationships she shared with each of her seven husbands. She did love a few of her husbands, but most of her marriages were made to further her career, or to hide her own secret and life long affair with the great love of her life. What I loved was that when she talks about her secret love, it is the only time you really see the real Evelyn Hugo. It is this hidden romance that is both touching and heartbreaking because of its beauty and its secretness that truly sets the novel apart from any of the other summer reads of 2017 since Reid so eloquently touches on themes that Im not going to outright spoil but will say that the unexpected part of the novel is an absolutely perfect twist that fully embraces feminine sexuality. The way the book was written was very captivating. It is told as conversations between Monique and Evelyn and the chapters are broken down by her different husbands. The details are lush and juicy and bring to life the glamor of Old Hollywood. The majority of the story takes place in the past with Monique asking questions of Evelyn in the present about what shes been told. I will say at times it was difficult to read about how sexualized women were in 50s Hollywood and suppressed because of their gender. The history in the book was extremely interesting as Reid explored the themes of sexism, sexuality, and domestic abuse in the 50s and 60s through to the historical changes experienced by women in the mid80s. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was an absolutely stunning read. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could, and it is definitely on my list of top reads of 2017. It is an emotional story that will leave you feeling so many feelings. The story is less about Evelyns failed marriages and more about forgiveness and acceptance. Oh, and about love, deep abiding love. If you love beautifully written stories about deception, dark secrets, romance, undying love, and heartache, then you will thoroughly enjoy this book. Reid has written another mesmerizing novel that is a perfect summer read!
4 stars I think everyone and their cousin who has been in the book blogging community for more than a month has read this novel, well, excluding myself, of course. I finally took the initiative to read my first of John Greens novels for part of The Reading Quest see the challenge here! as a Book to Movie Adaptation. This novel is about sixteenyearold Hazel Grace Lancaster who has a cancer in her lungs it was originally in her thyroid. Shes not a particularly complex charactershe likes reading and her family and thats honestly it. Hazel has to drag around an oxygen tank thats connected to her nose to help her breathe, and at one of her support group sessions, she meets a boy le gasp!. This boy is Augustus Waters, ex cancer survivor, king of metaphors and spewing pretentious bullshit, and leg amputee. Hazel, our nice, innocent, somewhat bland main character, plus mysterious boy Augustus Waters equals dY. I didnt like the romance between Hazel and Augustus. Thank you Loki for expressing my emotions so well dYs. But before I can actually go to explain this part of the novel, I have to touch on the characters. I found Hazel to be okay. Shes a bookworm and suffers from lung cancer, but thats the extent of her character. She doesnt really have friends and spends a lot of time at home reading and trying to avoid going to support group. If I had a terminal illness, Id probably spend all that time reading too. She was our typical female main protagonist who becomes more interesting and changes throughout the course of the novel. But I wasnt a fan of Augustus. He was just soA . . .A pretentious. The number of teenage boys like him is the same as my yearning to give away my books. Zero. I could kind of understand how Augustus used metaphors to a certain extent because Im sure a lot of teenage boys go through that phasethe mysterious poetryreading bad boy. But the cigarette was a little too far for me. Carrying a cigarette around as a metaphor for something that kills you but youre not letting kill you is just very over the top. I think Augustus aka Gus could have gone a lot farther as a character if he just simplified things and was more realistic, but then again, it would possibly null out the plot and he would lose the mysterious vibe that attracted Hazel. As Hazel grew tremendously as a character, Gus remained pretty static. He had some minor changes, but nothing as drastic and dynamic as what happened to Hazel. The side characters are all unique and helped further the plot, but I had no real connection with them. Because everyone, their cousin, and their pet dog has read this book, there will beA SPOILERS AHEAD. You have been warned. I didnt really care that Gus died because I didnt connect with him very well. I connected with Hazel a lot because Im just as bland as she is but I do like my book characters interesting. I admit, I did cry when Gus died, but not for the right reasons. I didnt cry because I was so sad that he was gone. I cried because, as much as I didnt like him, he made Hazel happy. I have my female main protagonists backsits very rare that I dont want them to be happy and would rather have them burn in hell for an eternity. No thanks. I just wanted Hazel to be happy, and even if that meant her being with some pretentious teenage boy, so be it. When I read, I dont usually imagine myself as the main character. I know some people do that, but I like to be more of that hovering person on the sidelines who nobody notices but is super invested in the drama. So I was invested in Hazel, but not Gus. And shes sixteen, they probably werent actually in love.A By the time the novel was over, I was pretty proud of Green for killing him off. It was the perfect push to get Hazel toA really change as a character and it made a great turning point in the novel. I found it implemented as a great plot device, and I think a lot of people interpret this novel as a romance, but I saw it as a contemporary. This isnt a story about Hazel and Gushe dies around 35 of the way through. This is a story about Hazel and how she changes as a character. This is a fact that gets lost in the romanticism of this novel. The reason I put of reading this novel for so long was because I thought it was aA romance, not a contemporary. Im not a teenage romance kind of person. Subplots? Sure. But most teenage romances dont last past college and it makes me sad to think about how although the couple is together, I dont think theyll stay together. But its not a romance in my eyes and this was why this book was so off putting. The buzz around it, frankly ruined my view of this novel before I even read it. Despite the early shortcomings, I enjoyed reading this. Green forms a unique, more succinct voice for Hazel and the plot is engaging and paced well. I liked the overall metaphors throughout just not Gus. The drama with Peter van Houten was very enjoyable to read and see Hazels hopes and dreams torn down and then built back up. The foreshadowing was done expertly and hinted at the plot, but not too much that it was blaringly obvious. I didnt love this novel, but I liked it. This and a combination of its flaws made me drop a star. Love being defined as OMG EVERYONE IN MY VICINITY HAS TO READ THIS. I found The Fault in Our Stars an enjoyable read, despite its shortcomings in the male main character and the romance. This popular novel thats garnered over 2.5 million ratings is a wellwritten novel about a girl and how she comes of age from a series of experiences, not a romance. Blog  Instagram  Twitter
 5 MIND BLOWN  EPICNESS stars !!  REREAD 14032017 SWEET ALIEN BABIES EVERYWHERE !! This is what I call an EPIC fantasy book !! Im SO glad I gave this another try because it was phenomenal and it left me speechless ! The worldbuilding and plot : Honestly, I really loved the Grisha Trilogy but Six of Crows was so much better ! It was more mature, darker, more actionpacked and had a smarter and more complex and epic plot full of twists that constantly had me on the edge of my seat ! Ill be honest, the first 80 pages were quite slow and had me struggling a bit to get into the book and you could easily feel confused, especially when you dont know the characters yet, but towards the end of Part 1, the action started and all the characters were introduced to us, and from that moment, I was completely hooked and found myself getting more and more invested in the story and with the protagonists. The plot in this book was so entertaining and different from any other fantasy books : it was a heist done by outcasts and not some heroes saving the world, and THAT was refreshing and SO thrilling ! I found the world to be even more fascinating than in the Grisha Trilogy, so mesmerizing and dark, and the way the author beautifully describes it makes it look real, dangerous but magical ! And the characters ?! They were just perfectly imperfect but so lovable ! The characters in this book, though quite young in my opinion, were really mature and complex characters. Each had a real personality with great characterization and heartbreaking backgrounds that define them. The characters definitely made the book amazing, and I loved that they were not your typical heroes gifted to be special and save the world from evil, but just a bunch of outcasts who have nothing to lose and would do anything for money ! KAZ is the leader and the brain of the crew. Hes a merciless thief, damaged by his past but never showing any weaknesses, very clever always with a step ahead of everyone and everything already planned out. At first, I had a hard time warming up to him because of his coldness, but slowly through the story, we discovered his past that made him the way he is now, so vengeful, and he slowly showed that despite the way hes acting, hes still able to feel and has weaknesses of his own. In the end, I completely fell in love with Kaz ! 3 INEJ is some badass girl, managing to make herself invisible and climbing anything with ease, who also suffered from her past ! She was very njoyable, kickass, brave, loving and loyal, but she was not the character I warmed up to the most even though I admire her strength and will to make a life for herself and the way she trusted and believed in Kaz despite his ruthlessness. NINA was definitely my favorite character in the crew ! 3 Nina was also badass, but not in the same way as Inej who uses her knives and acrobatic talents to be dangerous in a fight. No, Nina is a Grisha, more precisely a Heartrender who can smash your heart just by clenching her fist. But what I loved the most about her is how joyful and funny she is, making jokes and showing arrogance and confidence when truly shes always doubting herself. She was also so brave and kind, especially towards her people, the Grisha, to whom she so very faithful. Nina was so lovable and nice, I could only love her ! MATTHIAS was also my favorite guy in the crew along with Kaz ! In appearance, Matthias looks to be a huge merciless and heartless fighter and only set on his hatred for the Grisha. But Matthias is actually very sensitive, especially when it comes to the things he believes in, he has a heart of gold and can be quite shy, especially when it comes to dealing with Nina, but still remaining very badass. I loved his growth through the book, how slowly his mind changed regarding the hatred he had been fed with about the Grisha who he was told were abominations that needed to be eliminated, how he came to realize that he had only be told lies and that Grisha were human beings just like him. JESPER and WYLAN were very enjoyable characters as well, but to me not the most memorable in the crew. But Jesper was still there to lighten the mood with his jokes and teasing, especially with Wylan who is the shy one, the least criminal of them all. How I loved the dynamic between the characters, with smart dialogues full of banter, jokes or plotting, and the different relationships brewing between some of them. In this book are definitely two of my favorite ships ! Nina and Matthias relationship didnt start in this book, they have a past together, but a past marked by differences, hatred and betrayal, that leaves them fighting through most of the book. But be in the past or in the present, their relationship was always full of tension, heartbreak, passion and chemistry that they just couldnt ignore. Inej and Kazs relationship was more discreet but just as powerful and gripping, and it really revealed that Kaz was still a human being who had feelings. Their ship is one Im really rooting for because they would just be perfect together ! All in all, this book was AWESOME, EPIC, and BADASS and if you have yet to read it, trust me, the hype about it is legitimate !! If I had read this book in 2015, it definitely would have been among my favorite books of the year, but I guess it will be part of my favorite books of 2016 instead !! 
In my humble opinion, this book was 320 pages of info dump. The Martian style except somehow more... overwhelming. Please dont get me wrong, I am not new to this kind of format. Like World War Z and Illuminae Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff, the story of Sleeping Giants is told in the form of interviews conducted by a mysterious, nameless person who seems to have a lots and lots and lots of power as well as in the form of oral diary entries. I loved it when it was used in WWZ and Illuminae because despite it being quite straightforward and in the form of documentaries, these books were still able to touch me on an emotional and personal level. They showed many perspectives and angles about a particular, seeminglybutabsolutely dreadful situation, and they made me care  care about the characters, care about the outcome, care about how they would cope with their trials and tribulations. Sleeping Giants made me feel... indifferent, at best. Heres the thing: the premise is fantastic. I love the idea of aliens having visited the Earth thousands of years ago, back to that time we were still grunting and snorting to each other in order to communicate, and having left this gigantic monstrosity of a robot for us to find when we have progressed and evolved enough. In paper, that really sounds intriguing. Think of all the political drama that can come out of this! Think of all the philosophical, moral, ethical discussions! The drama! The panic and the riot and the coming together of mankind as they realize its potential as a defensive manuever against extraterrestrial forces! In an ideal world, I would have loved this to pieces and I would have paraded this all over my street saying, Science fiction fans, come get your mama! But alas, it is not an ideal world, and this book lacked the emotional pull needed for me to completely and deeply immerse myself in it. 1. Nameless interviewer. 80 of the book is comprised of interviews with a cast of characters. Theres Kara Resnik, a welltrained pilot. Theres Ryan Mitchell, her copilot; Rose Franklin, a motherly figure who leads the project of finding all the robotic parts, putting them together again, and finding out what it can do; Vincent Couture, an introvert linguist who hails from Quebec, among others. The anonymous interviewer is connected with all of them, yet we dont find anything at all about him. Hes their Daddy Long Legs, funding their research and making sure everything is going smoothly, taking care of problems  people or otherwise  as how you would expect an ultra rich guy would take car of them. But... what else? We see the story through his interviews, and we get to know more about the characters through his questions, and then thats it? He was definitely a pragmatist, and he was definitely very objective in his questions. What did this scenario make you feel even though I already know about it but well need to repeat it again just so our beautiful readers here are aware? What happened to you when this thingy happened even though I already know about it and were just wasting our time here reminscing about it? Nonverbatim, but you get the picture. 2. Telling than Showing And then theres the problem. Because of these questions, we are forced into reading a narrative that is 100 telling than showing. I was doing this, I was doing that, I felt this, I felt that, I didnt like this, etc. etc. It was absolutely dreadful to know that these people were experiencing these things and yet I couldnt feel them. I dont know, maybe because of the format it was hard to do so? Maybe because it was just so limited and theres no other way of showing them otherwise? But then, how did World War Z and Illuminae do it amazingly? Theres also the problem that things would happen in this book, but we would never, ever, EVER see them happening. Were only told that it happened postsituation, when the interviewer is asking them to tell us about their feeeewings. It was hard to just care when I was never with them when that happened, when I never felt the adrenaline or the tension that they experienced that would make me relate to what they were doing. 3. THE SCIENCE MADNESSSSSS Now, lets draw a line here: I love science. I love talking about aliens. I find space and the universe and everything that is in it fascinating. If I could, I would love to die floating in the vastness of empty space. But the science here made me cringe. There were just so much that it became overwhelming. The process of how to get the robot pieces? EXPLAINED IN DETAIL. The process of how they are trying to get the robot to work, all the theory and the steps? EXPLAINED IN DETAIL. The process of how they plan to do this and that, and then this and then that? EXPLAINED IN DETAIL THAT IT HAS BECOME PAINFUL. I get the need for science to be incorporated but it alienated the reader in me so much because so much of it were jargon. So many big words, and none of them resounded with me. Maybe Im just stupid? Maybe Im just not the target audience? But I DO love science, and I love it when it weaves together with the characters personal lives, so maybe its just the book being a hugeass infodump? In conclusion, Im actually very sad that I didnt like this book more. The ending was interesting, if not a little too positive for me to take seriously. But these three factors up there? They totally ruined my reading experience. The only reason I plowed on was because of obligation. I may still check out the next book though seeing as this is a series, in hopes that the narrative in that one will be a lot more personal and emotional than distant. However, if youre the type of person who is a science geek and just want to get your science mood on with or without the emotional touch, maybe this will appeal to you.

Okay, I admit it  I went into this novel thinking Id hate the epistolary format. Having just finished Maggie Stiefvaters The Dream Thieves, I really didnt expect for this book to hold my attention while I waited for Blue Lily, Lily Blue to come in from the library. I guess I had a lot of preconceived notions about epistolary novels, some of which were given fuel by reviews Ive read on Goodreads. Mostly, though, I was just afraid to try something new. Welp. I was wrong. So, so wrong. Its not often that I say this about a book, but oh my goodness, I loved Illuminae. LOVED. In fact, I think Illuminae has slapped me with my worst book hangover of 2015. I feel bad that I went into this story thinking Id dislike it for its differences from more traditional novels, especially because thats exactly why I enjoyed it so much. At the risk of being extremely basic, here are some of Illuminaes main and imo, most compelling plot points: SPACE COMPUTER HACKERS A BADASS HEROINE and heroes SWOONY LOVE AI WITH QUESTIONABLE SANITY ... Zombies? NonSpoilery Summary: Illuminae is a series of files which mainly focus on characters named Kady Grant and Ezra Mason. Set on two different spaceships fleeing a corporation which has brutally attacked Kady and Ezras home planet, Kerenza, the story bounces between several settings and characters in order to fully explain events. Using audio transcriptions, instant messages, surveillance footage, AI narration, and even vivid illustrations the rose was my favorite, Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff created a novel that is totally unique in both plot and format. As the files unfold, so does the story of our main characters, particularly Kady. A badass computer hacker who is witty, sarcastic, and brave, Kady is a fantastic character to follow and root for  even when everything falls apart. What I loved spoilers hidden: Honestly, I loved just about everything. From the very beginning Illuminae runs at breakneck speed, but that momentum never sacrifices character or plot development like some other novels do. Kaufman and Kristoff deftly incorporate a delicate love story, an entire fleet of commanders with questionable morality, bloodthirsty victims of a horrific attack, TWO spaceships, and a ticking clock throughout the novel that had me gripping the book with actual fear and DISTRESS. I had to read Illuminae with the lights on, because honestly, so much of it is either heartracing or straightup scary. Against my expectations, I also deeply connected with the characters. Kady Grant is a badass computer hacker YES, a girl hacker!!!, and Ezra Mason is an absolutely lovable jock and Cyclone pilot I thought of Cyclones like Gundams. At first I found their love story a little unbelievable, especially considering that they lost everything to a horrible attack on their home planet. But Ezra and Kady have incredibly strong voices, and as their connection to one another unfolded, it became impossible for me not to connect with them. Through instant messages they work together and come together, rebuilding a relationship that was broken by a secret in Ezras past. Along with Ezra theres also Byron Zhang, a computer hacker whos more or less trained Kady. The instant messages between Zhang and Ezra give readers a platform to understand all characters and their voices. We also get extra insight into Kady from journal entries, which I think really endeared me to her. Kady has lost almost everything, yet shes still willing and able to fight for what little she has left. As the story unfolds, its obvious that Kady is an unstoppable character. I loved that about her, from beginning to end. Illuminae asks a lot of the reader, and I thought of it like a puzzle. As you read you get hints and clues, and you have to guess and work to piece information together just like the characters are doing. I really enjoyed that. I especially liked the incorporation of the Artificial Intelligence, AIDAN. AIDAN, which commits horrible acts in the name of protecting the fleet is an incredible complex character in the novel. Just like Kady, readers have to figure out whether or not its become insane from critical damage, or if its ability to selfrepair has maintained its supposed ability to remain absolutely logical. There is so much danger in this story from beginning to end: an imminent attack on our two main ships, the Alexander and Hypatia, looms throughout the book; refugees aboard one ship become increasingly ill until they devolve into the Afflicted; AIDAN is considered insane and dangerous, yet shutting it down ensures that the Alexander has no defense mechanisms; Ezra Mason is throttled into space to battle enemies; Kady and Byron try desperately to hack AIDAN and save everyone they can. Through all of that, though, I never lost sight of the core of the story: Kady Grant wants to save the one person she loves, and she wants to make the refugees from her planet safe again. On a different note, I realized something whilst reading Illuminae: this books format is totally accessible to people who dont enjoy reading. When my husband not an avid reader unless it involves sports : saw me reading it, he was so intrigued by the spaceship illustrations, the creative AI narration, and the instant messages. As a former teacher, that made me think about the students I had that didnt like reading for various reasons. I think Illuminae, which feels sort of like a hybrid between a graphic novel and a traditional novel, could really draw in readers who either struggle with reading or maintaining interest in books. That made me really excited, and I hope this book lays the groundwork for more like it. What I wasnt crazy about: My main concern about the epistolary format was that it would distance me too far from the characters, setting, and plot. And to be honest, it did at first. Illuminae requires major suspension of disbelief, especially because it mercilessly throws readers into the world from page 1. Since this novel is told through a series of documents, it also requires patience. Nothing is given away if it isnt necessary, and as a reader you have to be ready for some confusion and cliffhanging while you read. This took some getting used to for me, but I ended up loving it within the first 100 pages. And let me just say: I really loved how this format threw out plot twists. SO GOOD. I had conflicted feelings about the Afflicted  people who suffered a biochemical attack and developed into terrifying, zombielike shells of themselves. Murderous, smart, and capable of hunting in packs, the Afflicted serve as a HUGE horrortension builder. I understand that theyre an example of how ruthless and evil the corporation, BeiTech, truly is. I also think they were an interesting example of the dangerous wartactics employed by the intergalactic world Kady and Ezra inhabit. So knowing all that, I get why their presence is necessary for the story. I guess for me they felt a little clunky since theres so much action already. I think even without the Afflicted, Illuminae would be a crazy edgeofyourseat read. That said, I get why theyre included, and they certainly didnt make me enjoy the book any less. TLDR; This was literally me during most of the book except for when I was cryinggroaninginternally screaming: I think Illuminae has everything: action, adventure, heartbreak, blinding plot twists, and characters you can cheer for from beginning to end. Please give this novel a try. Its interesting, its different, and its honestly my favorite book of 2015. And I mean, who doesnt like an actionpacked story set in space? I cant wait for the next book in this series! 2016 is going to be an awesome year for sequels.
The Song of David by Amy Harmon 5 stars!! He was clearly telling a love story. And my experience with love led me to believe this story would not end well. Love stories tend to be tragic. It is no secret that I am a huge Amy Harmon fan but every time I open one of her books I never know what to expect, I never know what journey Im going to be taken on, I just go with the flow and expect the unexpected. Her stories are always unique, always heart felt and always extremely well written, she is one of the masters of storytelling and this book is no different. ...Im all or nothing, all the time. I will say, I highly recommend you read The Law of Moses before reading this book. Moses is quite an integral character in this book and I feel you would benefit knowing the complete history between Moses and Tag as you read this story. Told in dual POV by Tag and Moses, the way in which Amy Harmon has delivered this story is pure genius. For a romance you would never have thought, but this works and it works amazingly well. Since the moment I saw you. It devastated me. And I love when a girl devastates me. Ive never devastated anyone before... Tag was introduced in The Law of Moses and this is his story. Once again, Amy Harmon delivers a character that you cannot help but fall in love with. Tag is a big man with a huge heart. While he is tough and angry on the outside, he is a pile of mush on the inside but only a few ever get to see that side of him. Tag is an MMA fighter, he uses this as an outlet for his anger and this man holds a lot of anger. We know his back story, we know where Tag and Moses met and we know that they saved each other and borne from this is a friendship that is so deep and a friendship that will last a lifetime. This relationship is prevalent throughout as the importance of friendships is really hammered home in this book. Wed run away together as lost boys looking for Neverland and somehow managed to come full circle as men. For me this was a book of two halves, from the very first word I was drawn in and as you read the beginning you cannot help but get that deep sense of foreboding. I spent the first half of the book on tenterhooks, waiting for the cards to fall while silently falling in love with another two characters. ...the world is too flat, people like me will slide right off. Millie was an amazing character, she is one of the strongest female leads I have read about in a long time. While most would have given up and thrown in the towel Millie was made of stronger stuff. She was resilient, she never gave up, she made the best of the hand that she had been dealt, she was strong, she was empathetic, she was loyal, she was just a beautiful character inside and out. You knew where you stood with Millie, she told it how it was, she didnt sugar coat, but sometimes you need someone like that, she was refreshing and she was just what Tag needed. Men have always fought. Women have always danced. Were as oldfashioned as it gets...were timeless. While most would never have given Millie a second glance or the time of day Tag was different, while others ridiculed and only saw the surface, Tag took the time to get to know the person underneath. They were total opposites, but they worked and they worked so well together. They brought out the best in each other and they gave each other what the other one needed. They may have been opposites but they were the final two pieces of a puzzle and when they last two pieces fitted together a beautiful story was born. Bullshit. You collect lost causes and charity cases like old, white women collect cats. As I said above, we are introduced to two new characters, Millie being one and her brother Henry being the other. I have to mention Henry, he was adorable. Another misunderstood kid that had struggled with life in general. He had his issues and Millie had been there for him through thick and thin, but his relationship with Tag was heart melting. Henry needed Tag and Henry gave Tag another sense of purpose. To see these two together was smile inducing, their relationship was a joy to see unfurl and the growth in Henry as a person was an amazing side story. You cannot help but fall in love with Henry, such an inspirational character. This is another Amy Harmon speciality, her side characters can be just as integral to the overall story and their presence just as important and Henry definitely fits the bill, he was akin to Bailey from Making Faces. Hes the eyes. Im the heart. Hes the hands, and Im the head. The second half of this book is where Amy Harmon becomes an emotional powerhouse, if I didnt have a lump in my throat, I had tears in my eyes which slowly progressed to a constant river of salt water. Few authors have that emotional impact, that punch to the gut but Amy Harmon delivers it effortlessly. Such is the character connection that your heart just breaks as this story unfolds before your eyes., the plethora of emotions you go through on this emotional journey will leave you feeling drained but you will know that you have read a great book, an amazing book. This is an emotional gauntlet, your emotions constantly on the edge, but at the end of the day this is a story that is full of hope, of love, of understanding and most importantly friendships. This was where we started our journey. And this is where it ended. This was a perfectly balanced book, you had that sense of dread, but it was lightened with some great dialogue, great one liners that will have you giggling and laughing. Yes it is emotional, but it is also uplifting. Amy Harmon always manages to do this to me, her words, the sentiments, the flawless writing always deliver a story that you will never forget. A story that will stay with you forever and characters that will leave their imprint on your heart. The Song of David is one of my favourites of Amy Harmons and is definitely a book I will never forget and will reread time and time again. Let me be your best of burden, my back is broad to ease your hurtin... As usual, I was not disappointed, I am just left in awe at this author, she never fails me and once again has delivered a perfect, poignant story. I seriously cannot recommend this author highly enough. I dont know what to do. I dont know what to do. I dont know what to do... www.theromancecover.com
After collecting my thoughts about it for some days, Ive settled on a 2 star rating. I didnt have the worst time reading it, even if some things really irritated me; but overall I cant really say it was an enjoyable experience, nor that it lived up to the expectations. Luckily, I waited a while to read it because I had read many negative reviews, and so I was also prepared when I did. But... yeah. Not good, sorry. I will say this, however: I do think it is important to remember this is a script. This was written to be staged and so I can understand some of its defects. Also, from what I read the play looks impressive, and I would like to see it on stage though I probably never will. Moving on to my review, this will be a long one so I apologize in advance. I organized it in things I liked and didnt like, hoping that this way it will be more organized Im not sure I succeeded...: Things I liked:  The nostalgia factor. Yes, this play was very different from the books and not nearly as good like talking about the ocean and a puddle. Yeah., but I still was incredibly happy to dive back into this world. So I think the nostalgia factor made me like this story more not much more, but a tiny bit.  Scorpius Malfoy. Predictable, I know, because everybody loved Scorpius, but he is without a doubt the best thing in this story. Socially awkward, loyal, sweet... he is just so adorable, I wanted to hug him all the time! Nobody cares about your name anymore, Scorpius, we just love you!  Draco Malfoy. Scorpius is precious, but Draco is also fantastic. Okay, maybe he is OOC as well because he has become a great person and a great parent... but what can I say, Ive always liked Draco even in the books, and I always thought he had the potential to become good. And he did. He was sooo much better than anyone in this play, apart of course from his son. So, yes, Malfoy power!  Scorpius and Albuss relationship. Okay, actually I have some reserves about it. On one hand, I really liked them, and I thought they were adorable. On the other hand, Albus was such a jackass, even with Scorpius, that he ruined many of their scenes together. The scene where Scorpius shouts at him was by far my favourite of the whole play. He deserved it so badly! So yes, it is a pity Scorpius was so perfect, and Albus was so annoying. Also, a special mention for ScorpiusRose. Again, I have ambivalent feelings: it wasnt satisfying at all, because Rose treated him very badly for no reason at all, and they had like two scenes together, but they were still cute. However, if I have to be honest to myself, I probably only liked them because I was attracted to the ScorpiusRose ship which had sailed right after the 7th books epilogue. What can I say, I always liked Dramione but Romione remains THE ship. Things I didnt like:  The plot is all over the place, as many readers have already pointed out. I will not go into huge details, but I will say what irked me the most. Firstly, this story doesnt feel like a Harry Potter canon AT ALL. Im sorry, but in my head this is not the 8th book. Maybe it is not exactly a fan fiction either but it does feel like it, but it seems like a story in itself, like an alternative universe sort of story. This is mostly because, and this is the second thing which irritated me the most, the plot has huge holes which are incompatible with the books, especially the 7th. Obviously Im talking about Voldemort and Bellatrix having a child right before the battle of Hogwarts. Again, doesnt this feel like a Bellamort fanfic? Anyway, the idea in itself is not very believable, but can we please talk about the timeline? If they really had this child right before the Battle of Hogwarts, how in hell was Bellatrix able to fight after giving birth? Okay, maybe wizards have some very powerful potions for this sort of things. I can accept that. But then why didnt anybody realize, when they were at Malfoy Manor, that Bellatrix was pregnant? Because she must have been then. So, no, sorry, not buying this part at all.  The characters are OOC. Im sorry, but everyone, more or less, is very different from the characters in the book. I quite liked Ginny, but the Golden Trio felt so off, I couldnt like any of them. Hermione seemed a shadow of her former self, and I wont even start on her version in the universe where she and Ron didnt get married. But Ron and Harry were so much worse for me. Ron is only a comic relief: he is a bumbling idiot and doesnt have a purpose. It made me so mad because he is one of my favourite characters in the books, and he is so much more than that. But Harry? Can we talk about Harry?! Harry, who for years suffered bullying and psychological abuse by the Dursleys, and then acts so terribly with his son? I know Albus is insufferable, but still I refuse to accept that Harry would say to him that he wished he wasnt his son, and then keep him apart from his only friend. NO. WAY. And what about Cedric Diggory becoming a death eater only because he was shamed in the Triwizard Tournament? NOOO!!  The new characters arent much better. As I said, I hated Albus, he was so full of himself and only thought about his problems, it was hard to feel pity for him. His siblings seemed better... but they have like one line in the whole play. Why?? Why didnt they have a bigger role? This was so disappointing. And what about Rose? She appears a little more, but still very little, and she seems mostly unpleasant for no good reason. His parents seem to have gotten along decently with Draco, so I dont see why Rose should be so mean to Scorpius. Also, the speech about her and Albus being able to choose whatever friends they want because their parents are famous? Seriously?!  And what about the characters who arent there? Again, I know this is a play, and the cast of characters is already quite impressive. I can understand and justify it, but Im still pissed we didnt see Teddy and Remus Lupin, Neville Longbottom and Sirius Black. Maybe including Teddy would have been difficult because he didnt much fit in the plot, but Neville? He was mentioned so many times that I was sure he would appear, and I was all ready to see him as a finally confident, content adult, and yet he didnt appear at all. And Remus and Sirius? Again, maybe I am not objective because they are my favourite characters, but many dead characters appeared, so why couldnt they as well? So... yeah. I am sort of happy I read this so I could form an opinion myself, but I will definitely not reread it in the future and I will try to forget the worst part and only focus on Draco and Scorpius Malfoy. And reread the ACTUAL books.
Well damn, this was a really cute book. It follows a teen boy named Simon who is gay but hasnt come out yet, and he is emailing this anonymous person he calls Blue that is also a teen that goes to his school but is not okay with coming out yet. One day this kid named Martin finds all of Simons emails and blackmails him saying if Simon doesnt put in a good word for him with this girl he likes, then he will post screen caps of their emails on the schools tumblr page. I thought the premise of the book sounded intriguing and I got so much more from this book than what I was expecting. Not only is this book a light cute contemporary read about a boy discovering his sexuality, but Simon also has a lot to say about our society, and he makes some really good points. He constantly brings up the idea that everyone should come out because straight shouldnt be the default. And he doesnt understand why he even needs to come out in the first place and declare his sexuality because he doesnt understand why everyone just assumes youre straight. I never thought about it in this way and hes absolutely right. Its kind of messed up if you think about it. By assuming everyone is straight it makes it seem like its not normal or not okay to be anything but straight. I just love that Simon really makes a point of this during the story. White shouldnt be the default any more than straight should be the default. There shouldnt even be a default. Simon is a totally relatable character. Even though he has a close group of friends, he sometimes feels left out and sometimes his friends hang out without him and he feels hurt, and this is something I can totally relate to. I felt the same way in high school. Also, he struggles constantly with debating whether or not to come out to his parents and his friends and he doesnt want to make it a big deal but he thinks it is and it was just really fascinating to watch him grow and develop and learn more about himself. Even though I am straight, I found these moments with Simon to be so inspiring and encouraging. He talked about the ocean between people. And how the whole point of everything is to find a shore worth swimming to. I was trying to figure out who Blue was throughout the entire book and I was so wrong. I thought I knew for sure to. I had two different people I thought it was and it was neither of them, so props to the author for actually being able to surprise me because it doesnt happen often. I absolutely adored Simon and Blues emails back and forth. They just put a smile on my face every time I read them, and it was adorable. I love their thing with Oreos, its just so unique and I love when books include random cute things like that. Things like that are what make a book different from all the other books. I love watching Simon experience all these new things, like drinking his first beer and really falling in love for the first time. I also loved reading about Simons very strange family. The force him to watch The Bachelorette and then skype his sister whos away at college to discuss it with her; and I mean really discuss. Its hilarious. I also love how on Christmas they play Facebook Scavenger Hunting and they have to find a post related to: Someone visiting somewhere tropical, someone who just broke up, someone who posts song lyrics, etc. Its just so unique and hilarious and Ive never heard of anything like that before. That also has a lot to say about our society when you think about it. Our Facebook posts are so shallow and repetitive you can literally play a scavenger hunt game with them. Just another one of the many reasons I dont use Facebook. But Im tired of coming out. All I ever do is come out. I try not to change, but I keep changing, in all these tiny ways. I get a girlfriend. I have a beer. And every freaking time, I have to reintroduce myself to the universe all over again. Simon is also very sarcastic and its freaking hilarious to read about. Like this: I spend all Sunday in my room switching between the Smith and Kid Cudi at top volume, and I dont even care if its too random for my parents. Their minds can stay blown for all I care. Its little things like that that really made this book great for me. Its so funny and he shares the same sense of humor and use of sarcasm as I do. Its just wonderful. I think my favorite side character is Abby. She is so supportive of him and its really sweet and adorable. But I also did like Leah and Nick, even though at times their relationships got a little dramatic. I couldnt believe Martin and how he constantly threatened to blackmail him, it was ridiculous. He was such an asshole throughout most of the book. People really are like house with vast rooms and tiny windows. And maybe its a good thing, the way we never stop surprising each other. Overall, I really adored this story. Its just so cute and fluffy and everything you would expect it to be and more. Its mysterious as you try and figure out Blues true identity, and its adorable and rewarding when you do. I love the relationships he shares with his friends and his family. Its just a hella cute read.
I have heard endless good things about Anna and the French Kiss since I started my book blogging. It has been sitting on my shelf for a year now yet Ive been hesitant to read it, due to all the hype surrounding it, I didnt want to read it and find myself disappointed. Yet, when one of my best friends read it and completely fell in love with Anna and the French Kiss, I decided to read it this summer holiday. I started reading this book on Christmas day and I finished it when I went to bed that night. I fell in love with this book, just like my friend, and the rest of the bookish community, guaranteed I would. Anna and the French Kiss is about 17 year old Anna, whose father, bestselling author of sappy romance books, sends her to a boarding school in Paris for the year. Anna is not happy at all, she has her best friend Bridgette and things with her crush are finally looking more serious, but when she meets Etienne, she hopes that maybe shell find romance in the City of Love, problem is...hes offlimits. But as they become best friends they both realise theres undeniable chemistry between them, but with lots of obstacles blocking their way, will Anna get that French kiss she has been waiting for? Anna and the French Kiss is a magical read. The author perfectly describes the scenery of Paris. Ive always wanted to travel to France and through reading Anna and the French Kiss, I was able to do just that. I loved navigating the cobble stone streets with Etienne and Anna, eating the sophisticated Parisian cuisine and viewing the vintages movies at the authentic cinemas lined up along the street. I absolutely fell in love with Paris in this book, and I hope that one day I will be able to visit it myself. I think Ill start this review by saying how I adore Stephanie Perkins writing. She has such a magical way of writing, and her novel is just such fun to read. I also love that its not this fluffy read, it has depth to it and deals with serious issues that makes you sympathise with the characters, as experience turmoil and you really feel a connection to them and are just rooting for them the whole way through. Like I said, Perkins is an utterly fantastic writer and I spent the whole day in bed, or on the couch, just constantly reading and devouring the stunning story that Perkins has weaved with her enchanted words, loveable characters and swoonworthy romance. It is seldom that I find a book that I purely enjoy and that all I want to do is read the book the whole day. Anna and the French Kiss is one such novel. To me, the most wonderful thing about this novel are the characters. Theyre so real and they all have such powerful voices and powerful words that resonates inside the readers. Theyre all so authentic, and theres this witty dialogue and heartwarming moments that will have you producing tears and sighs of contentment. Its all just so perfect! I cant describe the sweet, romantic and frustrating moments that take place in this book...you need to experience it for yourself. I absolutely love Anna! Shes got such a honest voice and such a charming personality. I found that I could really relate to Anna, not in the way of being sent to live in Paris or such, but by the way she is a perfectionist, she is a natural worrier and freaks out about germs. There were times when I was reading that I was like Thats so me! or I do that!. Anna is also a great friend and she generally makes decisions based on how it will benefit her friends. I also love Anna and Etiennes relationship, but Ill talk about that later. I just honestly love Anna as a narrator, shes just so cute. I love how she loves watching movies and has a website where she reviews movies, which I can relate to with my book blogging...knowing this also adds a more personal aspect to the novel. Etienne...Oh MY GOSH...I finally know what all the hype is about! I absolutely ADORE him! Hes just so sweet and loving and perfect! My heart broke for him when he had family issues and I just wanted him to feel better again. I just love him so much! I absolutely adore the relationship between Anna and Etienne. It built up from this sweet, innocent friendship to this full on romantic relationship. I love how theyre best friends and then they become more than that. Everything about the relationship is just so perfect! The way Etienne slowly coaxes Anna out of her shell and shows her the ins and outs of Paris was beautiful to watch. I love how they built each other up and made each other more confident. Their romance was so extremely sweet and I love how they were best friends as well as being in love. It did infuriate me though when they kept denying their feelings for each other, as I just wanted them to officially get together. Perkins wrote their relationship wonderfully and inspiring and she captured the rollercoaster of emotions of falling love in all its bittersweet glory. The hope, the joy, the wondering....the heartbreak and devastation. The secondary characters were written brilliantly as well. From Rashmi, Josh and Meredith, Etienne and Annas friends. I didnt really like Rashmi, I could never warm up to her. I didnt actually hear of Josh that much, but he seemed like a nice quy and an extremely talented sketchist. Meredith was sweet and I felt extremely sorry for her towards the end...especially seeing as shes in love with Etienne too. There were also some jerks at Annas school and I felt so sorry for her when false rumours started circulating around the school. The story in itself was stunning. I loved how we got to familiarise ourselves with Anna and how her and Etienne friendship slowly built up to something bigger. I loved exploring Paris with both of them, I loved the whole story. I loved Anna and the French Kiss and I found it a charming, delightful read! Youll fall in love with the characters, especially with an English boy with a French name. The story is scrumptious and I completely devoured it. Anna and the French Kiss is definitely one of the best contemporaries Ive read, with stunning, realistic characters, beautiful scenery, an exquisite story and a heartwarming romance, Anna and the French Kiss has everything and more that youll be looking for in a contemporary.
For full review, visit:  It has been several hours since I have finished reading It Ends With Us, and I am still unable to stop the train of emotions that hit me while reading this book. I am so behind my reviews right now, but I need to write this one right this instant. Not because I want to get everything out while it is still fresh because I am certain I will remember this story and all the feelings it brought out of me for a long time. But because it is not only the best book that Colleen Hoover has written to date, but it is one of the few books that affected me so deeply, that I think deserves to be read by every single person on this planet. The only other contemporary book that has affected me this much is In The Stillness by Andrea Randall. I am not sure if I want to outline all my emotions in full detail, or leave it vague because I went into this book completely unaware of what the story was about, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. So for those who have not read this book just yet, all I can say is just read it. It follows an incredibly mature, strong and wonderful character Lilly who narrates a tremendously deep storyline with many life lessons, love stories, terrible and wonderful actions, lifechanging experiences, friendships, family bonds, and overall, the perfect outline of what is like to be human. It gives muchneeded perspective on life and certain actions us humans often need to take. At least it changed my perception on quite a few sensitive topics. The strength of the book comes from Lillys character, and the wonderful writing technique Colleen Hoover uses in telling her story. A first persons point of view results in the reader sharing the same emotions with the main character. The storys continuation throughout several years, also giving insight into Lillys past through diary entries addressed to Ellen DeGeneres, provides tremendous depth of the story. But mostly, it surprises the reader making them fall in love with all the characters, excusing their wrongful behaviour on several occasions, and seeing the reasoning behind it. Not only it is an incredibly powerful story, it also is a great lesson. I believe every single person can find something relatable in this book. Colleen Hoover really outdid herself with this one. Although I have loved all of this womans work, when I think about some of her books now, I am not sure that the present me would like them as much as the past me. However, I guess with me maturing, I can see Colleen Hoover developing as a writer as well, and giving me exactly what I need with her every piece. So if you have not read this book just yet, I could not recommend it enough as it is truly lifechanging. But be warned of an emotional rollercoaster that is guaranteed to fall upon you. I have read this book during a long coach journey, and I hope not that many people saw me crying for a good couple of hours. So find a comfortable spot, preferably not in public, and read it. Discussion Now for those who have read this book or are not too bothered with some spoilers, I will continue with my ramblings since I do need to get all the emotions that I am feeling out right now. Abuse and the romanticizing it has been a topic that really gets me worked up for quite a while now. I believe far too many books make the abusive alpha males into people who are supposed to be admired and desired. Whereas some texts show only the really horrible parts of the abuse. Coleen Hoover struck the middle of it, exploring the idea of the abuse when it is not just black and white. She completely changed my perception on abuse, towards the abuser, and especially towards the victim. I am one of those people who see the victims of domestic abuse as stupid if they do not have the strength to leave this kind of life instantly after such incident occurs. Experiencing abuse myself on quite a few occasions, it was always hard for me to understand how this kind of behaviour can be excused. I have felt the physical abuse from my mothers boyfriend, and abuse by words from my stepgrandfather, and I could never understand how my mother and grandmother could be so weak and not leave those men. Especially since this abuse was directed towards me. I do not know if it affected my development as a person, but I always want to think that I dealt with it in the best possible way. I never took it, I never stayed silent, I was never afraid, and I always felt in the position of power. I did sometimes feel disappointed in the examples the women in my family were setting though. Now I do understand that it is not that easy. I guess my thick skin and the ability to see reason comes from the lack of emotion towards my abusers. But this book has opened my eyes to the reasons why some women find excuses. Some abusers are not just bad, and with love involved, the good part can easily overshadow the bad. I have seen this example in my stepgrandfather. He is an alcoholic, therefore has two personalities: when he is sober, he is good and caring, and when he is drunk  he is the meanest person on Earth. I always hear my grandmother telling everyone how good he is, but I was never able to excuse his bad parts just because he has good ones. I still do not excuse this behaviour, and never will, but I can see why she chooses to see the good instead of the bad. Regarding this book, it was haunting how relatable I found Lillys relationship with her father and her mother. But what confused me profoundly was the way I felt about Ryles character. I believe that abuse is never excusable, and yet I found myself trying to find reasons behind his behaviour and hoping for a happy ending for him. I loved that character, and although it is impossible to compare real feelings, I do get it now why many women forgive their abusers. I liked the outcome of the book very much, and believe that Colleen Hoover has written the most touching, realistic, and informative story about domestic abuse, and how it is almost never as white and black as you usually wish it was. My perception has changed so profoundly after I finished reading It Ends With Us, my heart was shattered into a million pieces, and yet I think this book should be read by every single woman on Earth because it shows the true colours of life. All humans make mistakes. What determines a persons character arent the mistakes we make. Its how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses. It really was a hunting story, it affected me on such a deep emotional level, and confused me in the way that allowed me to grow up some more. More books lie this should exist. Sorry for my ramblings, but sometimes getting everything out is a necessary step you have to take. I am certain I will remember this book for a long time, therefore my thoughts will always by here to be read whenever I need it.
Free kindle eBook, courtesy of author Keri Lake sent through NetGalley. This is the first story that Ive actually read in over 25 years, if not longer. Im going to be honest and admit that I dont write great reviews but this story is worth one and if you read it, the story speaks for itself. My reviews are simple and short but This one is lengthy and I hope I write a descent review that wont put you to sleep. This is a dark contemporary standalone story. I also want people to know that sales from Keris books she gives portions to charity in Detroit. You Never Forget the Sound of Gunfire How the ringing drowns the screaming inside your head. No matter how loud, its always louder, until the bullet hits its mark in an explosion of pain. Unrelenting fucking pain that soars through the flesh and leaves a gasping hole in its wake. Blackness settles in and for one fleeting moment of bliss, all is lost, you become numb, traipsing the fine thread between life and death. I wish the bullet had killed me. At least if it had, Id be certain of three things: I could forget the darkness of her eyes of her eyes as the blood drained out of her body. Id no longer hear the promise that I whispered in her ear. And the barrel of my gun wouldnt be crammed down the throat of a man whod begged for his life moments before I cut out his tongue. But thats what happened when you shoot at something impenetrable. IT RICOCHETS Ricochet is the BEST contemporary romance story that Ive ever read or listened to and it has a Dual POV. Keri Lake has done it again! She made a perfect decision when she decided on a contemporary romance story. If you know Keri, then you know this wont be your typical, boring love story. Hell no, thats not Keri Lake, she has to be dark, gritty, gruesome, and write a story that leaves you in awe and she did. Honestly, I absolutely HATE reading, Im an Audiobook fan. When I heard Keri Lake was writing a different genre, I knew I couldnt pass it up and had to read this story. Wow, I am happy that I did. I feel privileged to have received a copy to read and I wasnt disappointed one bit. I truly am amazed at this story and truly believe this is Keris best story to date. I find myself surprised at how good an author can write and often wonder what goes on inside there head. With Keri, I think I know but Im not exactly 100 sure but I have a good idea. I believe when Keri picks up her pen to write that magic flows throughout her pen, hell, even her fingers that are stroking her keyboard. Her writing is perfection, the dialogue, emotions that pore from her story, the darkness all coincide with each and every character and this story took my breath away. I believe that stories show up in her head and she cant escape the characters, the story until she writes it down. I felt like I was on one crazy rollercoaster ride in the dark that had so many twists and turns that it shook me to the core. Keri loves Detroit for those of you that dont know much about her. She based it on Detroit, its the perfect setting, a place where anything can happen. Keri Lake is the type of author that lets it all go, she doesnt hold back, and it works for her. This might sound crazy but I truly believe that once a story comes to get mind that she has to let it out. I think the story and the characters start messing with her head. Dont get me wrong, Im not saying shes crazy, lol. I think the stories come alive in her head and the characters tell her what to write. Heck, maybe Im the crazy one but whatever happens inside her head it works. Shes extremely gifted, talented, and Keri is going places and rise as an author. I believe her stories are so great because she puts more than heart when writing a story, I think she feels the same emotional feelings as the readers do, and she connects herself when writing a story. She bonds with the characters, shes not scared to write what she feels, and Damn, she holds nothing back. This is why I believe with everything in my entire being that she writes perfect stories and shes a perfect author, one who lays it all down and out there for us to read. This is a dual POV and by adding a third narrative she made this story brilliant. I dont like contemporary romance stories, Ive listened to my share but I absolutely LOVE Ricochet and I will read all the romance stories Keri Lake throws my way, thats the honest truth. Just to throw it out there, this is a standalone but Keri has decided to write a kinda spin off, I cant wait to see her outdo herself with Backfire. I believe this story will be even more mind blowing than Ricochet. I have all the faith in the world that it will be a story to remember. Youll be shocked, maybe even outraged by what you learn about Nick Ryder. I guarantee you wont walk away from this story. This story leaves you quaking, shattered, broken, but I guarantee you wont put it down. You may even find yourself obsessed with Nick. This is a fast paced story, filled with action, that had my stomach in knots and my heart racing. As for Nick and Aubree I found myself in a lovehate relationship with the two. I hated them at first but as a flower that blooms, my love for the two blossomed as well. Life changed for Nick Ryder five years ago. He had everything he could ever want, a beautiful wife, a son, and a reason for living. But one night that as all taken from him when a ruthless taskforce, one that was assembled under Mayor Michael Culling. The mayor came up with the brutal strategy to make the streets of Detroit safe and everything was ripped away in a deadly hunt called the CULLING. To defeat a monster Nick had to become a monster. Anger was where Nick felt alive. Nick needed to survive to feed some twisted, charred part of his soul which hed been waiting for a plan, craving something he couldnt formulate inside his own head. Nick believes the one thing to hurt Michael Culling is to take his wife, kidnap her and get revenge. I love Nick, his determination to plan revenge, and follow it out, yet even as circumstances change, Nick still remained a mystery to me. Nick didnt plan for the mess that Aubree Cullings life really is. He thought that her husband loved her and it would crush him to learn of her kidnapping. Aubree has her own ghost and darkness. In public, she did a great job of acting and putting on a great show for the public eye but alone shes tortured. Aubree sees Nicks pain, hears his cries at night as she embraces them. Michael has beaten her to submission and broken. Her husband treats her bad, beats, marks her, rapes her, and makes sure she knows he owns her and she belongs to him. He makes sure she knows that she cant leave and he can do whatever he wants to her and enjoy it. Then along comes this man Nick who takes her. I saw darkness in her beauty, and she saw beauty in my darkness. Yin and Yang. Black and white. Beauty and scars, fury, and forgiveness. She shouldve been my nemesis, but in her, I find something I didnt know I was looking for. I shouldnt have wanted her. Sex with her was forbidden, after all, as I was the loveless villain, and she the prized possession of a man whod taken everything from me. Kill her. Destroy her. Break her. Could he really though? Perhaps Nick and I were opposites in life, as he said, but in pain, we were the same. Two broken halves with jagged edges that seemed to fit together in some messed up way. In the end, he saved me, and in return, I saved him. Eye for an eye, heart for a heart.
Its one of the most important and current books I have read in way to long and everyone should read it!  It took me a couple of days to figure out what and how i wanted to review this book. Because this book and the topic of it are so unbelievable important and realistic! It feels realistic, and sadly too many aspects of this book are real for way to many people. But it also had a good amount of problems in my option that if it was any other book that didnt handle such an important topic so fantastically would have been at the most a 3 star book. But lets get into all the things this book did so BRILLIANTLY!  The main character Starr She feels so real. Her struggles, her feelings, her trying to survive and being honest and at the same time kept getting obstacles thrown in her way that make her fall or almost fall. But she keeps going, and i loved that about her. She is strong and a fighter and knows what is right and tries to do that as best and as often as she can even if it is sometimes really, really hard for her. I also love the relationship between her and her family. They dont always agree, or unconditionally love each other without questions. There are struggles, there are moments that someone does something the others in the family dont agree with. There the parents are not happy with the kids, or the other way around. But to me that only made the book more realistic, more honest. And with that even better!  the writing: I am not going to lie and say that the slangdialect the book is sometimes written in didnt take me a while to get into. It did. I am not native english speaking and so the dialectslang the characters sometimes speak in wasnt something i loved. It was realistic. But made it sometimes a bit harder for me to keep going with the story, so i loved that the author wrote most of the book in typical proper english as the main character states it at The overall way the plot is written is also fantastically done. It makes sense, it flows it works all so that from start to finish the story feels like it fits together very nicely!  the plot: Not only the actual topic of a black boy being shoot dead and the reaction of it, but also how the reaction is, was so BRILLIANTLY FANTASTICALLY done that i can not even start to describe how well the author did it. She manages to show both the side of the white officer and Starr the black witness. How other people react to it all, how some people cry out in outrage how little the police reacts to a black boy being shoot dead how they try to push it on the boy, say he was a gangster, a drug dealer, a bad guy no matter that he was long 16 years old and had no gun or did anything wrong. And how the people that Starr spends every day with  the school mates, her family and friends, neighbours and just everyone she interacts with everyday react to what happened and how she has to react to those reactions. It was all done so realistically, so real world reaction, that it didnt feel like a fictional read. and honestly? That is horrifying and so unbelievably sad! And make this book even more important and so current! Most of this book really is fantastically done. So realistic, so current world problems important, and so well written and told! There are a handful of problems that i found unnecessary or unneeded, especially since this book was already long not necessarily too long, but its not a short book with almost 500 pages and you do notice its a bigger book, its not only of those books you feel like only having read 100 pages even if you already read 500, its a book you notice how much you read, because of the dense and brutal topic it handles! but with all the added issues the book handled the boyfriend drama, the best friend drama, the actual ending of the book.... it sometimes felt rushed and as if the author should have taken a couple of pages at least to elaborate more on those topics or scenes to make them worth being in the book. I also thought that sometimes Starr, who is always fast in pointing out racism or anything that points to unfair behaviour towards nonwhite people, she was not without her own problems in trying to see the other side of things. She expect everyone around her to always be thoughtful about people that are not white, but at the same time she is constantly getting on her boyfriend for being white? Why? She knew that he was white when she started to date him, so why is she constantly picking fights with him? It just... for me it that was not a needed or necessary part of the story and i think the book would have been a couple of pages shorter without the boyfriend and nobody would have missed that unnecessary added drama. To me those scenes just felt like they added a drama layer to the entire book that i didnt see as necessary at all. Maybe that is just me personally. I am not black. I am not from America. Maybe every little thing in this book was exactly as it should be, as it is realistic and in the real world. I dont know that because i only know the issues this book handles through social outlets the news, social media and other web outlets instead of actually being near the situation. So i dont know if the ending for example is really realistic and exactly as it happens in situations like this. It felt a bit fictional and as if the author tried to find a good, happier ending for this hard punching story I understand why she did it the way it happened. I just thought it felt a bit .... fake for the lack of a better word for it. Still... those smaller moments that i noticed throughout the book take in no way away from the overall brilliance of this book. so let me say it again: this book is important! It is current! It is a must read! It is eye opening about a topic we all know and hear about but show us the issue from a point of view most us thankfully never have to live it through! Read it! Appreciate it for what it is, a view into a horrible situation that we should all work on changing and making better for the future, because sadly this book is about a real issue! Because maybe the characters in this book are not real. But there are hundreds if not more people in this world that actually are real and are currently actually living through exactly this situation! So keep that in mind and appreciate the book even more because of it! And no matter if you love this book. If you love the characters or the writing or the ... anything. You have to appreciate what the author did. How she handled such an important topic and managed to keep it real without over dramatising the entire situation. Because there is no need for that. The initiation is dramatic and horrible enough. no need to add fictional drama!
This book needs another rating system, with more than 5 stars really! I waited for ages to read this book and it was so good Im happy I waited so long as now the whole series is out and I can read them all at once! This is the story of Ruby and of her freak friends, children born in a future US where teens either die or develop frightening abilities. So frightening theyre being taken away from their houses, contained in camps to rehabilitate these kids while theyre experimented on, let to starve and work hard. These camps reminded me of the concentration camps and kids had no better fate than Jews with some being slaughtered as they could not be rehabilitated. And that symptoms list, the one that was sent home folded and stapled by teachers, which was aired a hundred times over on the news as the face of the dead scrolled along the bottom of the screen? The government was never scared of the kids who might die, or the empty spaces they would leave behind. They were afraid of us the ones who lived. On her tenth birthday, something happens to Ruby and she is taken by the PSF Psi Special Forces, put in a bus with other kids, heading to God knows where. She is so frightened, so lost, they all are. I flexed my bare feet against the ground, trying to keep my legs still. Hunger was making my head feel funny, too, bubbling up every once in a while to overwhelm even the spikes of terror shooting through me. It was hard to focus, and harder to sit still; I felt like I was shrinking, trying to fade back into the seat and disappear completely. Shell soon arrive to one of the worst rehabilitation camps, one of the largest and will be sorted with the other kids. Kids are put under different colors, depending on their abilities. The Greens are wizards with technology; the Blues have telekinetic abilities. The Yellows can play with electricity, the Reds with fire and the Oranges can manipulate minds. Ruby will learn quickly its best to be Green and will convince her doctor she belongs with them. For six years, she is a wolf in sheeps clothing as her abilities make her a dangerous Orange. With no mean to control her abilities, to train them, she sees herself as a monster and does not dare touching others. Pure isolation and loneliness, thats what she feels and thats what she thinks she deserves. By the time she is sixteen, not everyone is happy with President Grays politic. Parents want to find their kids, people want to have proof of whats been done to them and the US economy is in shambles with rebel factions fighting against Gray and the Psi Forces. One of these factions, the League wants to smuggle kids from rehabilitation camps and use them to overthrow the government. Theyll help Ruby escape with another Orange. Instinctively, Ruby feels the League is not the knight in shining armor they pretend to be. They have their own agenda and she does not want to be used and abused again. She will escape and shell meet three other psi: a little Yellow adorable girl Zu and two Blue boys the charismatic Liam and the cagey Chubs. All want to find the Slip Kid, kind of a Messiah for psi kids. But their road trip wont be an easy one and not everything will be as it seems. Ruby is a survivor. She is weak in the beginning, let her friend take the blame and she does not dare defend her for fear of being discovered. She feels guilty for escaping and leaving the others behind. Im not brave. If I had been I would have owned up to what I really was, no matter how terrible. I would have worked, eaten and slept alongside the other Oranges, or at least stepped out of the shadows of the Yellows and Reds. But once she escapes the camp and meets Liam, Chubs and Zu, all she wants is to protect these kids who rescued and welcomed her. Her love for them will give her the force to become stronger, to embrace her abilities. I loved how she evolved. She is flawed, human but so determined to help the other kids in the end. Following Liams dream of freeing them all, shell do everything she can to make this dream come true one day, even if she has to sacrifice herself and play the devils game. I loved the writing. Alexandra Bracken had the gift to make me feel, breathe and see what Ruby saw. I sat alongside her on the bus, I saw through her eyes what the Orange kid did to that soldier when they arrived in the camp. I hurt when she thought she was a monster, that she never would be able to touch a loved one without hurting him. My heart rate spiked when she was bullied by the guards. Its some really powerful writing, captivating the reader from the very first sentence. Every single character in this book was solid and believable, playing a part in the overall intricate plot, my favorite ones being, of course Ruby, Liam, Chubs and Zu. The apocalyptic universe, the conspiracies, the factions, etc. were well thought delivering a solid dystopian novel. I was so taken by this book I did not write my review right away as I wanted to already have a taste of book 2. If you love dystopian novel, you really should read this masterpiece.
This, this is the book I have been looking for...the one that would break my reading slump. Its taken almost two months to get me out of it but this one , RED RISING, has me excited about reading again! This is like The Hunger Games on steroids, in Space, with the Roman Gods and not the down trodden, but the HAVES waging war on each other. This book was so unexpected, every plot twist had me clutching my stomach or getting sick to it or just not believing it. I sit here in the post after glow of reading a really great book and I just dont want to share with you. But I know you wont just believe me as I havent written a real review in such a long time. So here goes.... Characters Let me just make a blanket statement and say that Darrows point of view is the one the story is told from. Hes young, 16, married and just full of energy and anger and rash. But hes also chained, by his station, he is a Red, the lowest class and he just does the same thing, day in and day out never questioning if there could be something more for himself, for his family and his clan. For the other Reds. Darrow is a constantly evolving and growing character and as time passes, Darrow holds onto the best of himself, and lets go of the rest. He plays so many different characters in the novel, husband, rebel, leader, follower, friend, foe, healer, all while keeping his eye on the prize. Yes, I am being very secretive because I dont want to spoil anything for you. I dont even know what other characters to explain to you. There are so many others that are primary at times and then they fall away to be replaced by someone new. I will say that given the nature of the game its actually called school that is being played and because it is told from Darrows point of view, we only know the other characters as well as Darrow does. And in a cut throat game where there can be only one winner, loyalties will always shift and friends can stab you in the back in a heartbeat. The World This is the only minor fault I have with the novel, I dont get why the world is as it is. Why is everyone living on all the various planets and moons if Earth is still habitable? And it is, the novel says so. There is a very brief description about how the Golds got to be top dog and it had to do with them defeating Earth, but thats it. I would have liked a longer explanation. Im sure one is coming. But with the opening of the book, I can feel the sweat dripping down Darrows fry suit as he pushes himself in his drill, faster, harder, trying to mine more Helium 3 than any other crew. Brown doesnt overuse the word red to describe Darrows world and yet its the only color I see when I picture it, everything covered in a layer of red dust, people included. Its an underground desert to me. The other parts that are described again not giving anything away are rushed in some areas so that I dont get a clear grasp of what they look like and then other ares are fully developed so I know exactly what the landscape is like, I can picture it in my mind. The Story Yes, yes, yes!!! This was an amazing story for me. Im sure its been told before in some other way. But Brown puts the right character, Darrow, with the right amount of tragedy and heroism in him, and throws the impossible at him and because of the tragedy, not in spite of it, he is propelled to be heroic. He is the underdog, meant to be a rebel, a symbol for the Reds, but first he has to do something, become powerful so that he can be seen by them, martial their support. Because the Reds have no idea what he finds out about the planet. And with Darrow as a Gold, but the heart of a Red, he sees how difficult it is going to be to betray the Golds that he calls friends. But still, there is the one thing that started all of this, that one thing that broke him and made him reckless enough to risk everything. And it still drives him. Im not sure if I have read a story where the hero is driven by this one particular thing for so long. Thoughts I kind of shared those in The Story. I think it is almost perfectly executed. Just a bit more depth into what happened to Earth and why the world had to expand so far out into the solar system. How did the adaptations happen to make the different colored people. I loved Darrow. I thought he was vulnerable and young, strong and smart, caring and kind, but also harsh when he needed to be. His kindness and friendliness were both a strength and a weakness. He was really my favorite part of the book, a great character can make a book and Darrow is a great character. I cant wait to see what Pierce Brown has in store for the next book. This one did not end on a cliffhanger but it ended on a very big Oh WOW! I will say that I thought this would be one of those seven book series. I think it would be a shame to squash this rich, vibrant, vast world with an array of peoples and variety of villains into too small of a page count. Just saying I wouldnt mind reading about Darrow and his merry band of howlers a little longer than a trilogy. I would recommend this to older teens as there is a lot of violence, sexual themes and adult situations and language. This is Science Fiction but doesnt get gadgety or anything. It is set on Mars. Im just trying to get across if you dont like Science Fiction dont let it stop you from reading this series. I have a feeling the next book will get more techie, but I am ready for it! It has a dystopian feeling to it so those of you that still dont have enough of that...youll be happy with this. If you loved The Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, this is your cup of Tea. I loved how the Roman as opposed to the Greek Gods were thrown in and youll like how they meddle in things. So you like the gods, youll love that. It doesnt have a Young Adult feel to it. At least I didnt think so. Maybe because the Golds all had to act like adults when they fought each other. In any case, Id recommend even to those who dont read YA. I received a copy of this novel for review from the publisher for review. This in no way affected my opinion of the book or my thoughts in my review. I was not compensated for my review.
Katy Swartz is forced to leave her life behind when her mother decides to move to West Virginia to start over. Having already lost her father, leaving her home, her friends and her school just before senior year isnt easy. When it turns out her new neighbors are aliens, Katy can almost take that in stride. What she cant take is Daemons hot, cold and colder attitude toward her. Tired of being a pushover, she is determined to stand her ground and fight back. Which proves to be more difficult than she would have imagined. Because as much as she cant stand Daemon, she is drawn to him. With every insult, cruel remark or show of arrogance, her anger grows, but so does her attraction to him. But there are rules. And there are risks involved with getting too close. And if she cant stay away from Daemon or keep him away from her, then it wont be only her, but Daemon and his entire family, that will be in danger.  Obsidian is the electrifying, actionpacked and tensionfilled first book in the new Lux trilogy by author Jennifer L. Armentrout. The immediate, intense and sizzling chemistry between the main character Katy and her next door neighbor Daemon will instantly captivate readers and pull them into this world of rivals, danger and forbidden attraction, that wont let go. In this story of aliens  both good and bad, beautiful and ugly  it is the thrill of danger and the excitement of the unknown that keep these two characters alternately drawn to and repelled by one another. And it is this magnetic pushpull that will keep readers on edge, as they discover just who Daemon really is, just how much trouble Katy is really in and what lengths theyll have to go to keep everyone safe. Author Jennifer Armentrout has managed to write a book about aliens that weaves together elements of science fiction, drama, action and romance in a way that is enticing and incredibly appealing to readers beyond those simply lured in by the science fiction aspect. Right from the start, the tension between these two characters builds and continues to build until they and the reader are ready to explode, making this one electricallycharged and immensely entertaining story that is unputdownable. As this is a novel aimed at a more mature young adult audience, there is a bit more violence, language and sexual content than is typical in a young adult story, but nothing that feels over the top, out of character or unnecessary to the story. Obsidian is a deliciously tormenting, absolutely explosive must read with an ending that will leave readers begging for the sequel. On the blog I gave this my six star rating On a personal note: Obsidian was such an amazing surprise and a book that kept me completely twisted up in knots because of that little dance that Daemon and Katy did throughout the whole entire book. Talk about chemistry. Well, this story was all about the chemistry between the two of them. Sure, there was all sorts of action. The pace was definitely quick. The story was completely intriguing. But it was that electricity between Daemon and Katy that just made this story so aaaahhhhmazing. I dont know how many times I wanted to scream at the two of them to get on with it already because the push and pull was just too tormenting. And yes, I mean tormenting in a really good way. The author did such a fantastic job of keeping me on edge throughout the book, wondering what would happen. When it would happen. If it would happen. I wanted to skip to the end just to find out. I barely restrained myself. Barely. There were a few choice scenes that made my heart race. A few scenes that made my blood boil. And a few scenes that made me so worried the story would end before coming to a satisfying conclusion. And while the author did tease right up to the end, its a conclusion I can live with for the next long while as I wait for the release of Onyx next spring. I love when books surprise me and what a surprise this book was. On so many fronts. I read the first chapter on the authors blog when she posted it and I fell in love with the very hot, very much the bad boy, Daemon Black. What I didnt realize, until I read the description on Goodreads after having requested the book on NetGalley, was that Daemon Black wasnt a demon. This was a story about aliens. I am not a fan of reading science fiction. And Id never read a story about aliens. So when I began reading I was worried that I wouldnt enjoy the premise of this book at all  hot boy or no. Even one where the main character is a book lover and book blogger who does IMM vlogs, WoW posts and sometimes gets zero comments on her reviews. But if all books about aliens were anything like this book, Id proudly wear the I believe Tshirt and download every book I could. Because this story was so addictive and totally unputdownable and I was devastated that it had to end. Katy is not typical of my favorite heroines. She doesnt have nearly the snark of Alex in the authors other series, who I absolutely adore, though shes not weak or completely sarcasmfree. And she definitely has claws. But I like that shes different. And her personality is the perfect yin to Daemons yang. Oh but how I do love Daemon Black. Though Im sure not everyone will. Hes not particularly nice. In fact, he can be downright cruel at times. Most of the time, actually. And hes so unbelievably arrogant. But he has those green, intense eyes. He has some seriously wicked awesome powers. Hes incredibly sexy. And every so often he says or does something surprising. And rarer still, he can be sweet. But its rare. And I dont always trust him. And that name. I love that the author gave him the name Daemon Black, because its so opposite to what exactly he is. Though it suits him  its a hot name and he is definitely hot. As I havent read any other books about aliens, I dont know if the story is unique, but to me it was new and different and fascinating and exciting. I really never thought aliens could be exciting, aside from the kind youd want to annihilate, that is. Though there was one scene in the cafeteria, where Katy noticed the table of too beautiful aliens that kept themselves separate from the human population that did somewhat remind me of another lunchroom and other beautiful people, but that similarity quickly faded when Katy did what she did  Im not saying what  that kept me grinning for several pages. If I could immediately reread this book I would. It was just that good. Ive still got it stuck in my head and I know that even if I were to reread it, Id be just as tied up in knots anytime Katy and Daemon were together as I was on my first read. And there will definitely be a reread of this book once I get the finished copy. If I manage to wait that long. My favorite nonspoilery passage: He lowered his head until the edges of his dark curls brushed my cheek. I was caught between wanting to crawl into my locker and crawl into him.
Once upon a time, a man came from the sky and killed my wife Hows that for an opening line. I have finally gathered my thoughts enough to try to write a review, but Im gonna warn you, I am still fangirling and having trouble finding the words to express how amazing this reading experience was for me. I loved Red Rising and this book was my most anticipated release of 2015 thank the gods I only had to wait until the beginning of January, I dont know if I would have made it if there had been any delays. In the first book we saw Darrow evolve from a ballsy helldiver devoted to his young wife into a fearless leader and weapon for revenge. In Golden Son, Darrow is struggling with his dedication to the cause because he doesnt agree with the tactics the Sons of Ares have been using in recent attacks and he has developed relationships with some of the Golds. He is also trying to come to terms with the feelings he has for Mustang and how that reconciles with his grief for Eo. Golden Son picks up a few months after the events of Red Rising. He is the leader of his own fleet at the Academy think Mars Institute from Red Rising but set in space and he is beginning the final battle of finishing school. He has assembled a crew that has some familiar faces, but also a few new ones. Severo is not part of this group though and that makes me a little sad because he was one of my favorite characters from Red Rising. I LOVE that little Goblin! In fact, that may be my only complaint; it took too long for the Wolf Pack to get back into the mix. They are total badasses. After the battle, Darrows time at The Institute is completed so he is sent back to House Augustus. The turmoil of trying to please the man that killed his wife makes my stomach knot and while I was reading I kept hoping that this would be the book that provides Darrow the opportunity for his revenge. For seven hundred years, my people have been enslaved without voice, without hope. Now I am their sword. And I do not forgive. I do not forget. So let him lead me onto his shuttle. Let him think he owns me. Let him welcome me into his house, so I might burn it down. Brown weaves together several smaller plots playing out within the larger storyline of this book flawlessly. Here are some of those mini plots: Darrow hasnt heard anything from the Sons of Ares and he is getting concerned. Have they forgotten him? Has he made poor choices and now they are abandoning him to his fate? Why have they not tried to contact him now that he is Lancer of House Augustus??? WHO is Ares? He has so many questions and no answers and no direction. He is in a blood feud with his former best friend, Cassius Bellona, because Darrow killed Julian Bellona during the first level at the Institute. Actually, ALL of the Bellonas want him dead and the only thing keeping them from killing him is his choice to align himself with Nero Au Augustus, his wifes murderer. Even though he is currently aligned with Augustus, he intends have his revenge for Eos death. Then there is another complication; Darrow has fallen for Mustang, the brilliant daughter of the man that killed his wife. Talk about a complicated relationship with your inlaws... To complicate things further, the Sovereign, Octavia au Lune has some plans of her own... My favorite characters were all new with the exception of Severo. In this installation we meet Ragnar, a scary as hell stained obsidian; Kavax and Daxo Telemanus, who are Paxs father  brother. They are as large and adorable as Pax seriously a pet fox, I die. I think Darrows character is developed significantly more in Golden Son than it was in Red Rising, but he doesnt loose an ounce of the grit and determination that made me fall in love with him. But this is why I was made. To dive into hell. The action scenes are fantastic. This book makes me want to wage a war and run into the battle screaming like a wild thing. You guys, this book is AMAZING. This is absolutely NOT a filler middle book. The earlier scheming and plotting all have higher risks in this book and the potential impact of outcomes is on a much larger scale. We find out what Eos secret was that she whispered to her sister the day she died and even though I saw it coming it still crushed me. We finally find out who the leader of the Sons of Ares and we learn the story of howwhy he started the rebellion. I wont spoil who it is but I will say his reasons parallel Darrows so closely that it is no wonder they have a similar vision and drive. Then the cliffhanger at the end... Holy Shit. I cant begin to describe how much I love this series. Pierce Brown is BRILLIANT. The man is a genius and I would love to be at one of his brainstormingoutline sessions because I suspect even his worst ideas are better than half the books Ive read. His writing style is engaging and the way the action unfolds in this book makes me physically incapable of walking away from the story. The characters haunt me and make me desperate for more. I just... I cant even. And I know we are undone. That is all.
There will never be another author as brilliant as Colleen Hoover. She is oneofakind. Every story that she writes is a masterpiece and I dont think its possible for her to write a story that I wont like. I am always amazed that each story that she writes is somehow more original and unique than the last. Up until now Slammed had been my favorite book of hers, and now Ugly Love is taking that spot. Ugly Love tugged on my heart strings. My heart ached while reading and I did cry toward the end. Now, you might be thinking, Oh thats no different than any other Colleen Hoover book, because lets face it each of her books are quite emotional and I have shed a few tears while reading them. But, Ugly Love has a different vibe from her other books. Not only is it an adult book, but its heavy on the sexual tension and angst. Its not a light and fluffy read. This is not a book that you read when youre in the mood for something that makes you laugh and feel happy. This is a book that you read when youre in the mood for something that makes you feel and rips your heart to pieces. Ugly Love is a raw, emotional, captivating, consuming, intense, and full of angst story. Its a story that sucks you in from the beginning and takes you on a journey. A journey that isnt easy and nowhere near perfect but the destination will leave you breathless and happy. Ugly Love is an unforgettable story and its one that I wish I could read for the first time again. I am in awe of the writing in Ugly Love. Colleen is an artist, she always brings her Agame, but she stepped it up in this one. She proved again that she is one of the best writers out there. She proved that she is capable of writing anything. She has a unique and incredible writing style that sets her apart from everyone else. Her writing is full of emotion, its poetic and lyrical. Its just beautiful. Ill give you a few details about the plot now: Tate is a nursing student and she moves in with her brother. She meets and is attracted to Miles. Miles is also attracted to Tate. Tate doesnt have time for love, and Miles isnt looking for love and doesnt want a relationship. They decided to have sex with each other with no strings attached. Miles has two rules: Dont ask about the past. And dont expect a future. Overtime, Tate begins having feelings for Miles and what they have, as messed up as it is, it means something to her. Miles refuses to open up and pushes her away time and time again. Miles is a character that you will love and hate. Hes emotionally shut down. He doesnt allow himself to actually feel and experience things. He made me crazy. I wanted to hate him but I just couldnt. I knew that he was holding back for a reason, and that there was something more to him. He was a damaged and broken person and I wanted to hug him and slap him at the same time during some scenes. I couldnt resist him. I fell for him. The story is written in dual pointofview and Miles chapters are from his past, showing us why he is the way that he is. You will not actually find out the reason he doesnt believe in love until toward the end of the novel and it will break your heart. You will have theories for what happened to Miles but when you actually find out it will shock you. Everything will make sense when you find out the truth. I couldnt hold back the tears while reading. Tate, just like Miles is a character that you will love and hate. I will admit that at times I wished she would move on and find someone who would love her back. She saw something in Miles that made her stay. Made her fight for him and I loved that she stood by him even when he was a jerk. I will say that Ugly Love does end on a good note. I know a few people who read some reviews and were worried about the ending, and havent read Ugly Love yet, because everyone is saying that its sad. Its a long road to get there but all of the puzzle pieces are put together and the ending was perfect. If youre in the mood for something on the emotional side, then this is the book for you. If youre in the mood for something that will blow you away, break your heart and then piece it back together, then this is the story for you. If you havent read any of Colleens previous books, you really need to do so ASAP. Colleen Hoover is an amazing storyteller and I highly recommend each of her books. Rating: 5 stars Some quotes from Ugly Love: God gives us the ugliness so we dont take the beautiful things in life for granted. Love isnt always pretty. Sometimes you spend all your time hoping itll eventually be something different. Something better. Then, before you know it, youre back to square one, and you lost your heart somewhere along the way. Sometimes not speaking says more than all the words in the world. I didnt fall in love with you... I flew. Read more reviews on Britts Book and Life Blog. You can also connect with me on Facebook.
 spoiler alert  This book was super adorable in a different way that I am used to LETS TALK ABOUT IT Actual Review Spoilers May be Present: Hiya Guys Welcome to the Nether! Today I am talking about Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins. I am going to say book this book actually blew me away because I been literally banning this book from my TBR for SUCH a long time just from the sheer well LOOK AT ITS FIRST COVER IT IT HIDEOUS. Look at it! You see how bad it looks right? Okay point taken it looks like a sappy romance novel. This book is kind of just that a sappy romance novel with actual realistic problems minus the whole boarding school in Paris thing. This book was actually realistic enough to understand the main characters feelings about what is going on in the novel at the time. You guys seem to be really excited for me to review this book, which makes me so happy to hear, it looks like I am becoming to Queen of Contemporary Fiction. LETS GET THIS STARTED SHALL WE ONTO THE PLOT. Anna is a ordinary girl with ordinary problems. Her dad literally ships her off to school in Paris out of her own freewill which btw like I said before I WOULD BE LIKE HELL TO THE YEAH LET ME GO TO EUROPE PEASANTS but thats beside the point and now she just feels alone. This is common for any teenager to feel, getting neglected by their parents and I found this to be very realistic. There at the boarding school she meets her friends Meredith Rashim I might be spelling her name wrong sorry Josh and Etienne Saint Clair who is British AND American. Beside Saint Clair having daddy issues and Anna having daddy issues the whole book centers around the two falling in love with each other over their senior year in High School. There is some cute scenes with them at the movies because Anna wants to become a famous movie credit when she grows up partying at the club until they become totally wasted like that doesnt happen in real life and the two getting knitted together like peanut butter and jelly over the most cute and fun book I most likely ever have read. People complain that this book really doesnt have a serious topic to go over other than Saint Clairs mother having cancer but you dont ever see her in the novel so why does that really matter. This book was suppose to be realistic, I did not take it seriously like I would have taken All the Bright Places, which is totally realistic in its betrayal of suicide. No one has a heart wrenching disease in this book which is a plus. LETS GET INTO THE POINTS: Point 1: We always start with the romance, so lets keep that trend going. I believed this couple in front of me Anna and Saint Clair. I believe that miscommunication can send mix messages to your significant other if you dont just flat out say that you are in love with someone and you wanna get in their pants. I love how this book kept going on and on about how Anna is a virgin yet she doesnt have any sex with Saint Clair in any point in the book. Anna is a normal teenage girl when she talks about her ordinary problems when others are having it so much harder than her. I liked the way these two were betrayed in a way that made them look like they are normal teenagers with normal situations happening to them. Besides Saint Clair having a rich father which only 1 percent in the world can relate to I thought these two were very well done. I thought they were whitty and very developed before they just flat out kissing each other. I like that the two did fall in love at first sight that happens with teenagers. I liked the way they interacted which didnt make it any less meaningful. LIKE THEM...and since they are the whole story I BETTER LIKE THEM. Point 2: Plot was pretty hassy in terms of not having anything serious going on. I had a problem with The Unexpected Everything because of this but surprisingly it works for this novel. The problems in this book are normal for teenagers teenagers fighting because of bullying. Teenagers falling in love with forbidden territory, it works. I have nothing wrong with this plot and how the characters fall in love even through all the hardships of it. I like that it seems like Annas world is falling a part even towards the end of the novel with the way everything seem to break because of rumors. I like that they fix everything but in a weird way that seems to make sense. I liked it all  It was very realistic besides this book being like in the 1990s where there is no texting and only emailing. I think this book was made in the early 2000s. I feel like Morgan Matson kind of copied Stephanie Perkins in terms of the plot for her lasted novel for some reason it just reminded it of it. Point 3: The side characters were a great edition to this book. You see a relationship between Rashim and Josh that falls a part towards the end of the novel. You see how Meredith never had a chance with Saint Clair to begin with because he only wanted to be friends with her. You see the catty assbag that the mean girl Amanda can be and how much of a douchebag a person like Dave can be. You see how teenagers react to one another I love the condom throwing that the councilor does. That made me laugh hysterically, GOOD JOB TEACHER. I love the struggles between the teacher and the main character every well done. I love the sturggles for romance between the characters and how easily their hearts can be broken. I love the exploring the characters do throughout Paris and it is not a place it is a person motto. It made me fuzzy in all the right places. Point 4: This book is not serious like I said before and that is something you can adore about it. I am getting a tote bag with the three form the trilogy and I am so excited now because I liked this book so much. I am starting to like to write about realistic situations more than fantasy because in spite of all the popularity fantasy gets it is not our world. I wish sometimes witches and fairies existed but it will never be possible. I think I will remember this novel as the book I should have picked up earlier. In conclusion I am going to give Anna and the French Kiss a 4.5 rating. I loved this novel and you guys pick up this novel yourself because DONT TRUST THE HORRENDOUS FIRST COVER THIS BOOK HAS WHAT WHERE THE PUBLISHERS THINKING. They fixed it though I am happy about that I WILL SEE YOU GUYS THE NEXT TIME I FINISH A NOVEL. BYE zzzzz Im sleepy
After collecting my thoughts about it for some days, Ive settled on a 2 star rating. I didnt have the worst time reading it, even if some things really irritated me; but overall I cant really say it was an enjoyable experience, nor that it lived up to the expectations. Luckily, I waited a while to read it because I had read many negative reviews, and so I was also prepared when I did. But... yeah. Not good, sorry. I will say this, however: I do think it is important to remember this is a script. This was written to be staged and so I can understand some of its defects. Also, from what I read the play looks impressive, and I would like to see it on stage though I probably never will. Moving on to my review, this will be a long one so I apologize in advance. I organized it in things I liked and didnt like, hoping that this way it will be more organized Im not sure I succeeded...: Things I liked:  The nostalgia factor. Yes, this play was very different from the books and not nearly as good like talking about the ocean and a puddle. Yeah., but I still was incredibly happy to dive back into this world. So I think the nostalgia factor made me like this story more not much more, but a tiny bit.  Scorpius Malfoy. Predictable, I know, because everybody loved Scorpius, but he is without a doubt the best thing in this story. Socially awkward, loyal, sweet... he is just so adorable, I wanted to hug him all the time! Nobody cares about your name anymore, Scorpius, we just love you!  Draco Malfoy. Scorpius is precious, but Draco is also fantastic. Okay, maybe he is OOC as well because he has become a great person and a great parent... but what can I say, Ive always liked Draco even in the books, and I always thought he had the potential to become good. And he did. He was sooo much better than anyone in this play, apart of course from his son. So, yes, Malfoy power!  Scorpius and Albuss relationship. Okay, actually I have some reserves about it. On one hand, I really liked them, and I thought they were adorable. On the other hand, Albus was such a jackass, even with Scorpius, that he ruined many of their scenes together. The scene where Scorpius shouts at him was by far my favourite of the whole play. He deserved it so badly! So yes, it is a pity Scorpius was so perfect, and Albus was so annoying. Also, a special mention for ScorpiusRose. Again, I have ambivalent feelings: it wasnt satisfying at all, because Rose treated him very badly for no reason at all, and they had like two scenes together, but they were still cute. However, if I have to be honest to myself, I probably only liked them because I was attracted to the ScorpiusRose ship which had sailed right after the 7th books epilogue. What can I say, I always liked Dramione but Romione remains THE ship. Things I didnt like:  The plot is all over the place, as many readers have already pointed out. I will not go into huge details, but I will say what irked me the most. Firstly, this story doesnt feel like a Harry Potter canon AT ALL. Im sorry, but in my head this is not the 8th book. Maybe it is not exactly a fan fiction either but it does feel like it, but it seems like a story in itself, like an alternative universe sort of story. This is mostly because, and this is the second thing which irritated me the most, the plot has huge holes which are incompatible with the books, especially the 7th. Obviously Im talking about Voldemort and Bellatrix having a child right before the battle of Hogwarts. Again, doesnt this feel like a Bellamort fanfic? Anyway, the idea in itself is not very believable, but can we please talk about the timeline? If they really had this child right before the Battle of Hogwarts, how in hell was Bellatrix able to fight after giving birth? Okay, maybe wizards have some very powerful potions for this sort of things. I can accept that. But then why didnt anybody realize, when they were at Malfoy Manor, that Bellatrix was pregnant? Because she must have been then. So, no, sorry, not buying this part at all.  The characters are OOC. Im sorry, but everyone, more or less, is very different from the characters in the book. I quite liked Ginny, but the Golden Trio felt so off, I couldnt like any of them. Hermione seemed a shadow of her former self, and I wont even start on her version in the universe where she and Ron didnt get married. But Ron and Harry were so much worse for me. Ron is only a comic relief: he is a bumbling idiot and doesnt have a purpose. It made me so mad because he is one of my favourite characters in the books, and he is so much more than that. But Harry? Can we talk about Harry?! Harry, who for years suffered bullying and psychological abuse by the Dursleys, and then acts so terribly with his son? I know Albus is insufferable, but still I refuse to accept that Harry would say to him that he wished he wasnt his son, and then keep him apart from his only friend. NO. WAY. And what about Cedric Diggory becoming a death eater only because he was shamed in the Triwizard Tournament? NOOO!!  The new characters arent much better. As I said, I hated Albus, he was so full of himself and only thought about his problems, it was hard to feel pity for him. His siblings seemed better... but they have like one line in the whole play. Why?? Why didnt they have a bigger role? This was so disappointing. And what about Rose? She appears a little more, but still very little, and she seems mostly unpleasant for no good reason. His parents seem to have gotten along decently with Draco, so I dont see why Rose should be so mean to Scorpius. Also, the speech about her and Albus being able to choose whatever friends they want because their parents are famous? Seriously?!  And what about the characters who arent there? Again, I know this is a play, and the cast of characters is already quite impressive. I can understand and justify it, but Im still pissed we didnt see Teddy and Remus Lupin, Neville Longbottom and Sirius Black. Maybe including Teddy would have been difficult because he didnt much fit in the plot, but Neville? He was mentioned so many times that I was sure he would appear, and I was all ready to see him as a finally confident, content adult, and yet he didnt appear at all. And Remus and Sirius? Again, maybe I am not objective because they are my favourite characters, but many dead characters appeared, so why couldnt they as well? So... yeah. I am sort of happy I read this so I could form an opinion myself, but I will definitely not reread it in the future and I will try to forget the worst part and only focus on Draco and Scorpius Malfoy. And reread the ACTUAL books.
Warning: Spoilers are present in this review It was easier for me to immediately get into the central story in this one, mainly because Harry has stopped being as moody as he was in the Order of Phoenix, and that in itself made me like the sixth installment in this series more. I think that The Half Blood Prince might be my favorite one so far just behind it is The Prisoner of Azkaban. I cant really say why, but there was something that kept me so immersed in it that I had to stay up late to finish. Thats not to say that the others dont possess the same quality  but even so, I felt it more here. It could just be the fact that I enjoyed the subplots more.Normally I dont like it when theres a lot of memories and flashbacks in a book, but J.K. Rowling unfolds everything so skillfully as always, and learning about Voldemorts past was quite interesting to me. I suppose he had a bad childhood, so that could have contributed to his evilness, but overall I think hes just crazy. It also answered something that had been puzzling me since the beginning of the Goblet of Fire  I didnt get how three Riddles were murdered in their big house. But with the explanation midway into the novel it all made sense. Ive learned to just go with the flo when it comes to the Harry Potter books, knowing that eventually Ill have no more questions to ask. I always felt like Harry was right to keep such a close eye on Draco throughout his sixth year at Hogwarts, especially after everything he heard on the train. I found it a little odd that Ron and Hermione dismissed Harrys serious suspicions about Draco so easily with the evidence that steadily kept piling up. I was surprised at the turn his character took, honestly. Hes always been a pest, yes, and definitely a worthy enemy of Harrys, ever since the first book. Still, I was sad when he started working with the Death Eaters, and by the end of HP number six, I felt really bad for him. He probably felt like he had no choice, what with his whole family being on Voldemorts side. That doesnt excuse his actions, though. Im curious to see what will become of him in the last one. I can honestly say that the HP books have the best secondary characters of any series Ive ever read and thats quite a statement, coming from me. I like to think Ive read a lot. Almost all of them have made some kind of impression on me, whether they were good or bad. For example, I kind of love Luna, even though she hasnt been around a whole lot, and was just introduced in the last book. She may be a little odd, but she has this open way of stating things; Im really hoping for some kind of happy ending for her. All the Weasleys will always have a special place in my heart. I was, however, kind of surprised by Harrys feelings for Ginny. They seemed to spring up very suddenly. I mean, theyve known each other for over five years and he just now realizes that shes pretty and awesome. I got used to it after a while, but I kind of wish the relationship had a little more development. I was really disappointed at first because Ginny was really quiet, and as close to a flat character as you can get in the HP books. But she actually showed some personality here, much more fiery than before. I was annoyed when Harry broke up with her at the end. It was obvious that Voldemort would use whoever Harry cared about against him, but he could just as easily use Ron or Hermione, and I didnt see him ditching them. In both the books and the movies, I have seen tiny hints of feelings between Ron and Hermione. I think that they came out a lot more in this one. It was obvious after Hermiones temper tantrum with the birds when Ron got together with Lavender who was extremely annoying. On one hand I felt kind of bad for the both of them, but on the other Ive gotten to the point where Im just really frustrated with their dancearoundthefeelings thing. I think theyre pretty cute together, though I do wonder sometimes what made Rowling decide not to put two of her main characters together. The most heartstopping, punch in the gut was definitely the end when Dumbledore died. I had some suspicion of it happening based off some comments Id read in some reviews, but I was hoping against hope I was wrong and it wouldnt happen. I had come to care for him so much as a character in this series that I was simply devastated upon reading about his demise. I actually had to put the book aside for a few minutes so I could cry about it; he was so wise and friendly, yet so powerful. I didnt expect Draco to be the one to kill him in the tower based on the way he was already acting he was crying earlier in the bathroom, after all, but I also didnt think Snape would be the one to do it. Obviously Ive always disliked him for his behavior towards Harry, but I was hoping he had really changed though maybe some part of me thought he didnt, even though five years had gone by without him murdering Harry. And the fact that Snape was the Half Blood Prince? I probably should have seen that coming, what with all the advice he gave coming out of a Potions book, but I really didnt. I still dont feel like I completely understand Snapes character, but as of now I hate him for killing Dumbledore. This book was an excellent setup for the final chapter, and though I want to put off reading it because its the last one, I know I wont because I just have to see how this all ends immediately.
Rating: 5 stars I JUST finished this and let me just take a breath hyperventilates OH MY GOD. I actually didnt think Id love this book so much. Simply cos I tend to stay away from all the hype. Not because Im trying to be hipster or whatever. But because I get so afraid of the book not meeting my super high expectations thanks to all the hype. This happened quite a few times to me. Which just RUINS the whole series for me cos I probably wouldve liked it if my expectations werent so high. BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. Ohhhhh, no. This book met my expectations and went far and beyond them. Okay, I suppose I should try and do a proper review by starting with a brief synopsis. Im afraid that otherwise this would just turn into a Love Rant about Peeta. The story is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lives in a dystopian world where the earth has exhausted all its resources and the land is divided into 12 different districts, each focusing on the production of a certain good. All of which is controlled by the Capitol. Every year the Hunger Games are held for everyone to watch. The Hunger Games is basically a morbid BattleRoyalecumWorldCup event where one boy and girl from each district are sent to the Capitol and then put into an arena where they have to kill each other off. The last one standing would be the victor and heshe and hisher entire district will be rewarded with food and other amenities that are sorely lacking in places outside of the Capitol. That is the gist of it. And Katniss has to choose between dying and killing. Dying would mean an honourable death and sort of flipping the finger at the Capitol who is manipulative and playing God with peoples lives. But killing and staying alive would be fueling the games and playing right into the Capitols hands. Also, things are made complicated with Peeta, the boy tribute from her district district 12, who is clearly in love with her and would protect her, even at the expense of his life. Would Katniss bear to kill him to be the victor? THIS BOOK IS PACKED WITH ACTION. And I dont mean just random fight scenes thrown in. I mean edgeofseat life or death situations and survival situations that the readers can only imagine in absolute horror. Its sort of Survivor the reality show meets Battle Royale. So there is tons of mind games that helps with the tension throughout the book. I was suspicious of everyone, even Rue. I was so sure she was gonna stab Katniss in the back, literally. But that flower scene broke my heart. Simply cos Katniss merged the identity of her younger sister, Prim with Rue her competitor and she ended up feeling as though she was fighting against her own sister. The pacing and writing is really spoton. I never felt that any scene was too draggy. Even when Katniss was starving or dehydrating. I thought it would be pretty boring but the way it is written, I was still rooting for her. Willing her to stay alive that I was kept engaged throughout the book. AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE TWISTS. HOLY CRAP. My heart literally skipped a beat each time a twist was introduced into the story and totally changed the course of where I thought the plot was heading. It was totally unpredictable and I was so confused and kinda scared of what might lay ahead. But that was whats SO GREAT about this book. Characters were ALSO great! I liked every one of them. Even the villains, even the Capitol, cos they were so morbid and strange. It was like reading of a new species altogether. Katniss was a great protagonist. She was strong, resourceful and hardened by life which means that she wasnt the usual whiny heroine we tend to read about in YA novels. Plus, shes totally badass with the bow  arrow. She can easily pass of as a Ninja and that is the highest compliment I can give ANY character. I do get abit annoyed with her as she seems a total devoid of emotion. And everything she does is calculated and done with a motive behind it. Even the funeral she staged for one of the tributes wont say who, though it was done out of respect. I felt that she just wanted to show the Capitol up. And her love scenes with Peeta. It was all... an act. Literally. Which BREAKS MY HEART cos I know how much Peeta loved her. Although I doubt she realizes how much she is relying on Peeta and sort of falling for him, she is all too aware of her relationship with Gale her childhood friend back home to let any of her feelings develop. It was like trampling on flower buds before they popped out of the ground. Such a waste. And Peeta. OH PEETA. Peeta, Peeta, Peeta... I am so in love with him. Its not even funny. I mean, yea, to be fair there wasnt enough airtime on Gale for me to feel for him. Although I do find him chivalrous and there is a something true about his partnership with Katniss and the way he looks out for her. But as awesome as I think Gale is, Peeta is just... amazing. Hes so gentle and awkward, thanks to the fact that he isnt nearly as badass as Gale and Katniss. But despite his shortcomings he tries his best to keep Katniss alive, even though there were times when I thought he had abandoned her. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DOUBTED HIM. Katniss kept emphasizing how good Peeta was at acting in love with her for the audience who were watching the hunger games. But we readers knew better. He wouldve done ANYTHING for her. ANYTHING. And my love for him just quadruples with each pages. Until finally my heart was wrenching in pain at the end of the book. I got really pissed off at Katniss. make up YOUR MIND WOMAN I felt so bad for Peeta cos I knew that the relationship was very onesided, but he pumped so much love into it that it was completely believable and sincere, looking almost whole. Okay, I should stop gushing about Peeta and mention other characters I enjoyed. I liked Cinna, Caesar, Cato and Clove. Dunno why they all happen to start with the letter C, thats strange. The only downside to this book is that I felt that the characterization wasnt thorough enough. I wanted to know more about the characters to make them less 2D. Even Peeta and Katniss, I felt like I needed to learn more about them. But I guess there will be more of that in the next 2 books in the trilogy. I also particularly enjoyed the flashbacks about Katnisss father and his connection with Mockingjays. This back story really allowed me to relate with Katniss more and made her character more likeable, as otherwise, I felt that she was kinda heartless at times. I was so relieved to see the softer side to her. Overall, this book is totally EPIC. Its the only word to describe it. It also left me breathless quite a few times and I had to stop reading for fear of what would happen next. That is usually a good thing and an indicator of the Thrill level this story has. Im glad that the hype on this series is not misguided and welldeserved. I am looking forward to the next two books as I wonder what is next after the Hunger Games are over. What would happen then? Gritty fastpaced writing laced with lovely characters and the constant foreshadowing of something darker, more dyer up ahead. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
PLATINUM LIPSTICK Taylor Jenkins Reid is often lauded for writing pieces that make the reader approach a subject from another angle, One True Loves is certainly no different. The concept at face value seems common enough, in book world I know Ive read plenty of stories where a widowwidower is given a second chance at love and happiness after grieving the passing of their spouse, in fact books that deal with grief sensitively and with honor are often the ones I remember clearly long after I turn the last page, but Taylor Reid uses this well versed plotline and flips it on its head. Emma first sees Jesse in high school, after pining away for him for the requisite time as is expected in teenage girl years she accepts that she may never be the object of his affection. One night everything changes, after years of doing exactly what is expected by everyone around them, Emma and Jesse find their soul mate in the other, the person who makes them reassess their life, makes them dream for something bigger than the world they currently inhabit, corny yes, but they complete each other in a way they never dreamt possible. After school they blow the pop stand that is small town life and set out on an adventure of sightseeing a world they never dreamt existed, they grew up together in all the ways that were important, they created a life together, planned a future together, stood in front of one another and declared their undying love for each other, they swore they would forsake all others, that their bond was in sickness and in health, until death do us part. Ive stood there on that alter, Ive declared my love for someone, I know inherently the weight those vows hold. Its the beginning of your happily ever after, well its supposed to be , tragically on the eve of Emma and Jesses first wedding anniversary, whilst on a work trip, Jesses flight goes down and hes gone, just like that, in the blink of an eye, Emmas world stops... it just STOPS... their plans for wedding anniversary celebrations  cancelled, their plans for travel and the future  gone, children and family and all the memories you imagine you will have, the years of joy and happiness you expect in your future...POOF...gone. Its a bitter pill to swallow, from having everything in the palm of your hand, to an emptiness so strong that you feel you may never be whole. One True Loves stole my breath from the very first page, you see the story bared too many similarities to a couple I met while on my honeymoon, allow me a moment to digress, my husband and I married on 20th February 2011, while honeymooning in Fiji, we met a couple, also newlyweds, as we chatted over cocktails in the pool bar we discovered that we shared mutual friends, that MM as Ill refer to them, actually got married the day before us, in a church not 30 minutes away, friends who attended our wedding, also attended theirs the night before, we laughed about what a small world it was, we shared our stories with each other, I learnt that MM were high school sweethearts, their wedding was truly the beginning of their happily ever after, they radiated love for one another, they doted on one another, their love was tangible, and yet not in that nauseating sweetie, baby, hunny kind of way. We spend half of our honeymoon together, went out for meals, relaxed in a tropical oasis and just enjoyed getting to know each other, we made plans to catch up back home, we saw each other briefly over the coming year, but never had that dinner like we planned. Unexpectedly in February 2012 M passed away, a week shy of their first anniversary, we were heartbroken for them, unable to reconcile what had taken place, unable to comprehend what M must be feeling, the pain the anguish, the devastation, we stood at his funeral and we wept with her, we wept for him, we wept for not only the loss of life, but for loss of dreams, we grieved the loss of the future they had planned. Earlier this year M walked down the aisle for the second time and married the second love of her life, for someone who once believed in one true love, life taught her that theres room in her heart for more than just one soul mate. Their story was one that floated through my mind while reading One True Loves, because while M like Emma has met two men that she loves unconditionally, and experienced that not all love is meant to last forever, for Emma she has the chance with her first love again. Years after Jesse is declared deceased, when Emma has grieved the loss of her first husband, when she moved on and forged a new life for herself, when she found love again, and once again found herself engaged to be married to Sam, she receives a phone call that will cause her world to stop once again, only this time Jesse isnt gone, this tine hes back, her husband is alive, and hes coming home for her. Were only supposed to have one true love right, thats the way fairy tales go... but when your past and your present collide, who will hold your future? I want to tell you about every moment that made my heart soar, from those delicious first moments of young love with Emma and Jesse embarked on what would become a love of a life time, I want to tell you all the ways that this book broke my heart, in those moments where grief and pain bubbled to the surface, when we felt every emotion Emma felt as she tried to navigate life in the early days after Jesses passing, I want to tell you about the real, raw anguish as Sam felt as he had to let Emma go to decide who she wanted as her future, the sense of unjustness that Jesse felt as he struggled to reconcile where the missing years had gone and the impact his disappearance had on Emmas life as well. I want to tell you how I was so enamoured by this story that I read it cover to cover twice because I wasnt ready to say goodbye, because I wanted to revel in Jenkins Reids words just a little longer, how I felt that Emma and Jesse and Sam deserved more than me just putting down their story and moving on with my life, that I felt someone had to celebrate this incredible journey. I want to tell you how I kept my husband updated throughout the story because despite being an ardent non reader, he could tell by my reaction to this book that it was something special. I want to tell you my favourite quotes and how they are scored on my heart, but I also want you to read this book without knowing any more than is mentioned in the blurb. Over a year ago, a trusted friend described TJR as an author of life lessons, an author who pushes you to think outside the square, who begs you to leave your preconceived notions of right and wrong at the door and trust her to take you on a journey, and after losing myself in this story I unequivocally agree. One True Loves is without a doubt a PLATINUM read for me. Raw, unapologetic and poignant, a must read for ANY book lover. I am who I am because I loved you once. 
Here we go. Ive seen a lot of people on Goodreads talking about how similar the plot synopsis of Red Queen sounds to Red Rising. I havent read Red Rising yet, so I cant speak to that, but I can speak to a similarity that I did notice that no one else has mentioned: The bones of this book, a lot of the elements that kept the plot moving forward, are straight from The Hunger Games. At first I thought, Okay, maybe it just starts out sounding like District 12, and then the main character leaves and it turns into something else. But no. The parallels became so consistent and obvious that I started a list of them in my phone: explanation of these can be found in the full review here . Listen. I didnt go into this book looking to find these parallels. I hadnt seen anyone else compare the book to The Hunger Games and I still havent. I wish I could have stopped seeing it, but to do that, I wouldve had to stop reading. Im not saying that any of this was done on purpose, but I am saying that it is bad writing. Its bad writing to be unaware that youre ripping off one of the most popular series in the same age bracket as the book youre writing. Its almost worse than being aware that youre doing it, because it shows carelessness. In fact, the writing is careless all around. Its heavyhanded and full of metaphors that dont work, descriptions that go on too long without managing to paint a vivid picture because theyre so chock full of metaphors that dont work, and hollow emotion. I remember one time specifically when Mare broke down crying for the first time, and I cant even recall what had happened or where in the book it was because I didnt believe the emotion behind it. A lot of Mares reactions to things seemed to contradict her actual personality and beliefs, so much so that she seemed more indecisive than anything else. It became difficult to keep track of what she actually cares about; one minute shell do anything to protect Gisa, then shes petty and jealous. One minute shes totally into Cal, then she hates him and Mavens her guy. She wants the Silvers to stop oppressing the Reds, sure, but she hesitates to do anything to make that happen if it means she has to hurt someoneeven a Silver, all of whom she claims to despise. A few examples of this are: Mare decides shes willing to trade the Colonels life for Cals; Mare decides shes going to kill Cal herself; Mare doesnt trust Maven at first; Maven shows up at the Scarlet Guard meeting and Mare doesnt think maybe hes there as a spy for his mother?; Mare knows that the tax collector has to die for the cause and shes fine with it, but then shes sad that his hands will never touch hers again? Even though shes never met him before, doesnt know him, and has never touched his hands until now? And so on. Shes so inconsistent with her feelings and her strategy that I did not understand what she was doing half the time. Finally, my other issue with Mare is that she has no skills. Or at least, her skills are never utilized to their full potential. She discovers her lightning power and rather quickly masters it, but this power is not specific to her life the way Katnisss hunting skills are specific to hers. I wish that Mare would have used her thieving skills in combat somehow, tied her backstory up with the person she becomes, but instead she ends up dependent on her lightning and nothing else. Adapting her District 12 survival skills into arena survival skills is part of what makes Katniss such a welldeveloped characternot doing the same for Mare is a glaring missed opportunity. Aveyard tries too hard to make her writing pretty, constantly repeating lines like red as the dawn and the shadow to the flame without realizing that half of them dont make sense. Flames dont have shadows, they have reflections. They have light. You need something else, something blocking the flame, to create a shadow. Some of the descriptive, figurative language works, but most of it feels weak and slippery; making sense of it is like trying to hold water in your hands: You think youve got it, but in the end it falls through your fingers. Most of the oneliners that are supposed to leave an impact would be effective if they did not get dragged out or if the author stopped trying to explain them so much. She doesnt leave a whole lot to the reader to figure out. The world is Silver, but it is also gray. There is no blackandwhite. Okay, fine. But... can I try something? The world is Silver, but it is also gray. BAM. You dont need to tell me that the world being gray means there is no blackandwhite, because a Nobody ever said there was blackandwhite, and b I get it. Gray is gray. Gray is not black or white. Just the word gray carries with it the moral ambiguity that youre trying to get across. Leave the readers to work with connotations on their own! I picked this example by flipping to a random page, but it is by no means the only onemost of the figurative language, in fact, is written this way. As for the plot, it was pretty conventional and I saw both of the plot twists coming before I was halfway done with the book, but I have no complaints past that. Its wellpaced and I didnt think it was too light or silly to be taken seriously. Curiosity got me through a lot of it. Im not pandering when I say that I did like this book. It was entertaining and I liked that the characters had a semblance of moral ambiguity even though it came across as moral inconsistency, and Im interested in where it will go. I liked Cal because, what can I say, Im a sucker for the boys with king potential and a lot of weight on their shoulders. But comparing this book to The Winners Curse does no one any favors; it does not even come close to that level of complexity and strategy and emotional depth. It takes features from The Hunger Games but, unlike that series, it doesnt have anything to say. This is definitely closer to The Selection end of the dystopiafantasy spectrum, which is fine, but sometimes YA readers expect more. Thats all Im saying.
I am still teamMaven. Scroll down to the spoiler portion of my review to read my theory on his redemption arc. Im either right or dead wrong, but my gut is telling me to there is more to Maven than meets the eye. Mare, I am very afraid for you. Things have been done to you, things no person should suffer. Youve seen horrible things, done horrible things, and they will change you. Im so afraid for what you could be, if given the wrong chance. Enter the world of shades of gray. No character will be spared. I FINISHED. AND I HAVE MANY, MANY THOUGHTS. Let me try to get them down coherently in GIFs find my review of Red Queen HERE: 1. First 50 I was mostly bored. Not that the writing wasnt amazing, because it was, or because there wasnt action, because there was, but because there was little romance and no Maven and no palace and I just wasnt as entertained as the first book. But that all changed the second half when things got GOOD... 2. A certain someones death hit me harder than expected.  I didnt like this person at all in the first book, and now Im thinking I should read one of the novellas to get more of this character. 3. I really loved Mare in this book. Im sure some reviews will say she was moping and angry but honestly she was REAL. Mare struggled to make the right decisions and be who they wanted her to be and she was haunted by the events of book one. Again, this series reminds me A LOT of MockingjayKatniss feels, but for me thats a wonderful thing because I loved Hunger Games and would gladly read scenes like that over and over. I got why it was so hard of her to let go of protecting Killorn and move into some sort of friendship with Cal. I liked that she didnt know how to interact with the children and people kept looking at her like she was a traitor to both Red and silver. I liked the way she kept the notes from Maven and the way she and Cal still mourned the boy they thought they had known. 4. The ending. OH DEAR LAWD THAT ENDING. Now that was an ending. His expression is unreadable, but his meaning is clear. With one hand, he points at his feet. His fingers whiter than I remember. I do as he says. I kneel.  Read below to understand my thoughts everything is marked as a spoiler FYI: That ending with Maven. I sensed it coming but it was just as epic as I hoped. I felt less chemistry between Mare and Cal in this book even though Im teamMaven I still loved Cal in the first and while I could be dead wrong, here is what I think: Victoria is setting us up for a Warneresque of Tahereh Mafis Shatter Me love story between Mare and Maven. I know it makes no sense he committed countless unexcusable crimes a la Darkling and Warner but do we know for sure that was him? Do we really? Did we see him actually hurt anyone in this book? No. Okay, well technically, he did hurt Mare with that branding thing but.... Gah. I just feel like there is some sort of explanation. Maybe somehow it protects her? I dunno. I just know there is more to the story. And all of the BAD things that DID happen, Cersei excuse me, Elara, was still alive and well. And do we know why she was in the prison? Do we really understand what was happening during that prison break out? Why was her hair graying and her appearance worn? I tell you why: because there is more to this whole Maven is evil business than meets the eye. I am getting very strong Juliette of Shatter Me vibes where Mare is going to start to understand or find out more about Maven in the next book and help him struggle to redeem himself by the end of the series. I am wishing for a HEA between MM but most likely I think she will help save him from himself and end up with Cal or alone. Maven is not pure evil and I dont think he is the villain the way we think he is. I think there are other factors at play that will be revealed like how we thought Warner was pure evil in Shatter Me only to find his actions explained away in the sequels. No one is born a monster. But I wish some people were. It would make it easier to hate them, to kill them, to forget their dead faces. Even Maven. Im sorry but quotes like that hint at my suspicions so well. SHADES OF GRAY, PEOPLE, SHADES OF GRAY. Now maybe you can think this is just wishful thinking. Your reaction to my prediction is probably this: And you can throw a hundred things Maven did in my face and tell me I cant explain all of that away. There are people who read Shatter Me who refused to forgive Warner. I realize rooting for Maven is crazy to a rational eye, but in books I tend to love and sympathize with the villain and Im sorry but reading that ending where Mare has given herself over to Maven in exchange for everyones freedom... I just know there is so much potential there. Maybe Im wrong and he really is a psychopath. But I got chills with that ending and it was because of what we might see in the next book. Im sorry but Im just not getting an epic love story for Cal  Mare, I think she is going to fall for Maven  try to save him from himself in the next two books. I could be dead wrong and I realize I sound crazy, but Im telling you, I think there is more to Maven than the villain Victoria has been leading us to believe. Shes a master at twists and I am TELLING YOU that I think Maven is her trump card. I think Maven is end game for this series and I do not think he is pure evil even though weve only been offered evidence of the contrary. Im calling it and if Im wrong, well maybe I am, but my author instincts are telling me there is more than black and white, evil and good. This series is going to be about SHADES OF GRAY. Final notes: Why oh why did I have to wait a whole book to get two scenes with Maven? I know why. Because Victoria is an evil genius and knows she is torturing us but its exactly what we need to get amped up for the third book theres four planned now, right?. Glass Sword did have secondbook syndrome it was building to future events and showing us character development and it was absolutely getting us to see how this world truly functioned, but it was truly necessary for the stage Victoria is planning to set. We all saw what she was capable in Red Queen, and I have faith the next two books will be a nonstop rollercoaster of madness now that she has given us all the building blocks and endeared us to all of the characters I see what you did there! so that she can let blood fly in the next. Did I love this book more than Red Queen? No. But I think Victoria did an excellent job preparing us for whats to come and building the world none of us really got to see in the first book.
Well, its been 4 months since I read and finished Six of Crows, so I think its about time I reviewed it. Or at least, TRY to. I still remember a lot about it, which is great, but I dont remember everything. So I hope I can still do this book justice, especially since over the course of those weeks, Ive thought about it often. And even started to reread it before its release date, but then I got into a really bad slump, and I sort of gave up on it. But I do want to reread it again, SOON, because its so worth the second look. I LOVED Leigh Bardugos trilogy, even with my lukewarm feelings toward Siege and Storm. I thought the ending to it was perfect; I adored the characters. I fell in love with the way she wrote, how she detailed everything and made it feel as if the world was real. And I was there. That didnt change at all in this companion; it was just a whole other area to such a fascinating world, one that I never knew about. Ketterdam is super different, yet also really similar, to Ravka. And this book can totally stand on its own; you dont have to read The Grisha Trilogy first. I do recommend it, just because itll give you so much background toward the places, and it even references two people, I think, from the other series. But its definitely not required. And I really liked that Six of Crows didnt need to be read after the trilogy. It was easy to separate what was happening in this, to what had happened before. And it was easy to fall in love with a new set of characters. Not that it was hard to fall for them. Not. At. All. If anything, these characters are so much easier to love than the ones in the trilogy. And not because theyre better, or more likable lolol this makes me laugh, but because there is just something about them that make my heart happy and give me so many feels. I fell HARD for them all, but especially Kaz Brekker. Its no secret that I love my broken bad boys, that I love the guys who are damaged and hurtful but who have softer sides to them. But hes so much more than that. His background shaped who he is, pushed him in so many ways, and became the driving force that turned him into the best thief in Ketterdam. And when you start to get to know him, beyond the manipulations and calculated ways in which he keeps his emotions in check and the thirst for power, you start to see exactly who he is. Not just a thief or a conman or a, lets be honest, a jerk. But someone who is just trying to survive in the only way he knows how to. I see that, and so does Inej. 3 She is, aside from Kaz, my favorite of the characters. Inej is a true badass, a boss queen who makes people bow down to her. I love this girl so much, and I just love that shes so powerful on her own. That she doesnt need anybody to save her. She is intelligent, quick on her feet, and deadly. Shes the heroine of her own story, a story that I NEED more background on since I feel like we still dont know her completely. But I loved the way she took control of her life, the way she didnt settle for anything less than what she deserved, even when she knew it could cost her. Her feelings for Kaz werent like a big deal; they were just a part of her. She didnt need romance or a guy to save her. And I needed that, because I feel like that doesnt happen often in YA books. The Wraith has such huge importance in this book, and I cannot wait for more of her. She is that AWESOME. The rest of the characters, Jesper, Wylan, Nina, and Matthias, all have big roles in the book as well. And I loved them too, but Kaz and Inej just hold my heart. Anyway, onto the others. Jesper is hilarious! Hes a sharpshooter who just lightens up the tense situations which makes him a little stereotypical, being THAT character, the comedic one, but hes not. Hes more than he appears, and hes not afraid of just being himself. le sigh I sure do love that guy. And so does someone else. cough Wylan, the privileged runaway, doesnt get as much time on the pages as everyone else and if I recall, he also doesnt even get a POV. But thats okay, because I have a feeling hell have a larger role in the sequel. Also, hes adorable, so well keep him. :D Nina the Heartrender and Matthias the convict had a bit of a history before this, so the sexual tension and unresolved issues between them was played to perfection. I adored how they werent a couple, but they were basically. The whole cast made for such fun and heartwarming dialogue inbetween all of the action. And there is A LOT of action, but the beginning is pretty slow. Leigh builds up the world carefully, and so detailed that it can make for a boring start which Ive heard from several people. But I was actually hooked from the beginning, and I think the largest part in why I love this book so much is because of the characters. They really make the story come alive, with all of their differences and backgrounds and personalities. The multiPOV is never a problem, because theyre all so unique, and the 3rd person narrative does make it easier to tell them apart, but I digress. Throughout the story, the characters are put to the test, and I just went crazy for the plot. The heist storyline had me intrigued, and I couldnt wait to see how it all came together. But man, that ending is a fucking killer and I am DYING for the sequel because I just have to know what happens to my beloved characters! Well. This was surprisingly easy to write, even after 4 months. So I think that goes to show just how much of an impact Six of Crows made on me. All I want is to dive back into this, but Im gonna make myself wait until closer to the sequels release date. But guys, this book is brilliant. It is rich and real and heartbreaking and funny and holy mother of God I just love this misfit group of characters SO much. 3 This is probably making me sound really crazy, but I JUST HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS FOR THEM OKAY PEOPLE?! Rating: 5 Paw Prints!
So I dont normally use this format for book reviews, but I found that I was so conflicted about Garden of the Moon, that it was the only equitable way to do so. To sum it all up in a few short sentences would be impossible, simply due to the scope and complexity of the work. Overall I did enjoy this book, as it serves as a launching point into the rest of the massive Malazan Book of the Fallen series, but this beauty is not without its warts. Why you should read it: the prose you see what I did there? Steven Erikson is an incredible writer. His prose is excellent. His incredible use of language comes across as very poetic, which is rather surprising for such a grimdark work. The world that he and his cocreator Ian has created a stunningly deep world. Yes, stunningly. It is rich with its many races, cultures, gods, and its magic system are pretty impressive. As you read it, you really feel like you are exploring a world that has indeed existed for thousands of years. Erikson is very imaginative using many traditional fantasy ideas and concepts and twisting them into his own machinations. There are dragons, wizards, assassins, and demons all in their own Malazan style. This book is just the launching point into a massive series of 10 books! That is not to mention the 6 other books that Ian Cameron Esslemont has written in the same world, which are apparently now considered as significant as the original Malazan series. There are also 5 novellas set in the world. All in all, if you enjoy Eriksons work, then you have plenty of it to consume! What you need to consider before you jump in: the cons. Wow, this is the most difficult read I have ever had. The book is overwhelmingly complex because there is simply too much going on, and it does not ease you into it. At times there are so many names, it felt like I was reading the Messiahs genealogy straight out of the Bible. Goodness, there are so many freakin storylines that are going on at the same time, that you can pretty much expect to be confused for at least the first half of the book. I have talked with many other readers, and they have all said the same thing about this book. If you are going to dive in, just understand that this confusion is inevitable and it is just a price you are going to have to pay. I honestly think that the author could have eased into these storylines better, but Mr. Erikson will not be holding anyones hands in these books. Beyond the complexity issue, one of the larger complaints that you will see many readers echo is about the lack of diversity in the characterization throughout the book. You will undoubtedly find reviews that say the characters are too flat. I have to agree. It seems that far too many of the characters just seem...interchangeable. Yes some have tremendous and intriguing powers and talents, but their personalities are annoyingly alike. It seems that everyone in this book is angry, sullen, and either completely hopeless or convinced they can slay gods. This I think is a major factor in the often lousy dialogue. Why do I criticize it that way? Well, it feels that the dialogue is not very dynamic. It feels as if every decision and bit of dialogue is already predetermined. Debates and attempts at persuasion rarely happen because the characters just know that the other person wont agree with them, or change their mind, etc. etc. This really makes certain bits of the dialogue just feel like cheap thriller. I cant count how many times an important piece of information was withheld, simply because, sharing it wouldnt have mattered anyways. Overall, I think most of the characters are generally unlikeable too. Now this is probably just my opinion, but overall I think out of the dozens of characters you encounter in the whole story, I probably only actually liked maybe five? Tattersail, Kruppe, Ralick Nom, Quickben, and Annomander Rake. I honestly would have been fine if just about every other character in the book would have been disposed of, because I had no emotional attachment whatsoever. Honestly even out of those five, only Kruppe and Rake have really intrigued me. In contrast, those two characters are incredibly well done. For such a detailed, deep book, there are some extremely contrived moments, shattering my suspension of disbelief. It really comes back to the lack of depth in the characters themselves. Examples of this are Perens love for Tattersail, which developed over what 1 page? Also his fierce loyalty and his desire to protect WhiskeyJack, at the cost of his own life? He doesnt even know Whiskeyjack, come on man! These DEEP relationships mainly for Peren are lame and unfortunately it cheapens what the author is trying to establish. I also felt that the book had a great climax, but the overall ending was too abrupt, considering everything that we went through just to get to that point. It seemed like it was rushed and lacked resolution. However, there are 9 more books in the series, so this complaint may not be justified. My last complaint is completely a personal issue that a lot of readers probably wont face, but the book simply delves into occult things too much for my liking. While I have no problem with the various gods and the magic concepts that are used throughout, I didnt care for how closely they resemble the actual occult. The tarot readings and the possessions seemed a little too real, if that makes any sense. In Conclusion While the cons do outnumber the prose I did it again!, the book has tremendous depth and creativity throughout, and you can see that you have just embarked on a huuuuge journey. But if you want to enjoy what is to come, you must be prepared to push through a book that isnt always fun to read. However, I do believe that it will be worth it in the end. Only time will tell.
Many thanks to Graham AustinKing for providing my a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review. To sum off the book with one word in its entiretyaEUR is impossible for me. I canaEURtmt. IaEURtmll use three words instead: dirty, claustrophobic and dark; as most of the story takes place in the mines of Aspiration situated below the lavish temple of the Forgefather. Worth mentioning straight away that while the plot and the conflict are created around a rather unique premise more on this later, the fact that where religion is involved, the deceitful and corrupt nature is a standard issue. Give a man power and they abuse it. LifeaEURtms simple fact! But that simple, tried and tested conflict was made into something different by AustinKing, by creating a religion unlike that of which are found in our real life. IaEURtmm sure, some blacksmiths are so dedicated and passionate about their calling, they would claim their profession to be a religion in its own, but in Faithless blacksmithing got a whole new level of structure. The starting of the fires, the placing of kindling, the melting of metal and folding glyphs of meaning into it all these tasks were rituals of significant importance and often accompanied by chants. It was rather mesmerising. The dedication with which those aEURritualsaEURtm were carried out with made me forget about the fact that itaEURtms HOT, itaEURtms hotter than hell. Not only from the fires, but also from keeping the bellows goingaEUR dirty, sticky work for some. For others, priests and devotees, it is a complete show of loyalty to the faith. But letaEURtms go back to the ironically named Aspiration. Deep in the ground, Aspiration is like a city of its own. When you live in Aspiration, you may as well give up all hope of ever getting out. Quite frankly, itaEURtms a bit like a concentration camp but for people who have been there a long time or even born in it, it makes no difference. Depending on their job roles, certain aEURclassesaEURtm have developed, meaning even though all workers are in dire conditions, some people have it better of than others. Essentially, any and every day in Aspiration is a day filled with hard physical work for the good of the temple and itaEURtms god. The usual method of fear and tyranny is used to keep the people in check so rebellion is out of the question unless you risk your life, no matter how desolate it isaEUR It is so, we meet Wynn who ends up being aEURsoldaEURtm to the templeaEURtms mining cause by his father due to difficulties on their farm. As we follow Wynn through the dusty mines and days full of backbreaking work, we learn more and more about AspirationaEURtms rules and subculture. ItaEURtms a dog eat dog world where every team of workers has to meet a tally or face getting whipped under public scrutiny. Meet your tally, your safe and you get paid. Meet your tally beyond expectation and from every team a member can have a chance to work their way up to the temple to become an acolyte to a priest. ItaEURtms a system, folks! Not much different to what we have going on IRL, if you ask me! Perfect for inspiration though as proven by Faithless dY Alongside Wynn, we meet his teammates and others who all add that needed depth to the story. There is plenty going on in the darkness of Aspiration. If you have the means you can hire a Listener to come and talk to the walls and find gold for your team, but beware thereaEURtms voices in the darkness. And when the voice gets you, you can say byebye to ever coming out of the tunnels. As you may have gathered by now, Aspiration truly is a dark and suffocating experience. Having the opportunity to rise above most people and advance to the temple as an acolyte in the temple sounds like a godsend by the Forgefather himself and yet, it comes with its own dark presence in the face of Father Ossan who likes to take advantage of boys, the dirty fecker! Respected in the temple, Father Ossan is ambitious but easily classified as scum of the Earth. I hated him. One of the acolytes training under OssanaEURtms hand is Kharios. His personal journey in the temples was building up to something, I could feel itaEUR and when the megatwist of holy crap surprise came, I saw 80 of the book in a whole new light. Having made a lot of cowardish mistakes, you can find it easy to dislike KhariosaEUR the fact remains however, that he is one of the bigger pieces in the story.  While the writing style was easy to follow throughout with prose and dialogue serving its purpose and not making me feel overloaded with information, and there being enough unexpected turns in the story, I did feel towards the end that it started to slow in pace. Maybe it was my claustrophobia kicking in and I just wanted to be done with the dark tunnels. Maybe I simply could not wait to find out how all of the main characters were going to be connected during the final act. Maybe I want to use that glorious hammer as seen on the cover on Father OssanaEUR I canaEURtmt deny though, that the premise of the book is certainly worth your interest and there is plenty of grimness to keep a darker fantasy lover bloodometer going steady. I absolutely love what AustinKing has built around the art that is blacksmithing the profession has long called out for a medium to remind us how cool it can be. I have purposefully left out mentioning one of the bigger pivotal events in the book, so what I have covered in my review is not the be all, end all of the whole picture. There is a lot more to discover in terms of characters, plot and twists while indulging in the great attention to detail which has been placed in creating the setting and the world with itaEURtms restrictive rules.
23022014 edited after i calmed down Sometimes, the sun sets earlier. Days dont last forever, you know. But Ill fight as hard as I can. I can promise you that. Day and June have to fight in order to make a better tomorrow, in order to achieve living in a country that there is no war and they both have to make sacrifices for their loved ones. This was a beautiful written book and I adored its bittersweet ending. If you dont want to be spoiled please stop reading this review. I wish Id taken notes while I was reading it so I could discuss the whole book but I cant do that because the ending consumed me and I cant bring myself to review the whole book. Therefore Im only going to be discussing the ending of this book without further talk about the other characters. Day gets shot twice by Commander Jameson and after that he is in comma. It was nice to see this scene from both Junes and Days POV. Day was so much in pain that after a while he wouldnt see June above him but his mother. His beloved mother telling him that his father and John are both fine and he has to stay here and take care of his little brother because he waits for him, while June was seeing the man that she loves unconscious, unable to respond to her, making her heart break into million pieces mine too. She comes to the need to ask for help from someone with the power to change whats about to happen, a higher power. Shes desperate and she prays, she prays for Days recovery no matter the sacrifice she has to make. This is the last time they see each other and Day knows who she is. THE LAST TIME. THE. LAST. FUCKING. TIME. Months pass until Day wakes up from comma. All this time June was by his side waiting for him to wake up and worrying for the worst. When he wakes up he doesnt remember who June is and June believes that this is the sacrifice that she had to make for Day to be okay. She believes that Day deserves a future, a life without her because she believes that she reflects everything in Days life that caused him pain. So here she is, deciding to act like she is actually a stranger to him and walk out from his life once and for all. At this point I started crying. I couldnt control myself. I turned the page and saw 10 years later I was about to crack. My heart was beating so fast and I read the rest of the book while I was walking in circles in my room. I was so nervous about what would happen. 10 YEARS LATER, June is now 27 years old. She had a relationship with the Elector but fortunately they broke up. She learns that Day and his brother are in town and she is invited to Tess place. While shes going to Tess place she sees him. That scene was so heartbreaking. Her seeing the man that she loves after 10 years. All grown up now and still not remembering her. They past through each other but he catches up on her and stops her. WAIT WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? DOES HE REMEMBERS HER? OMG HE DOES this is what I was thinking while reading that part. And she did reminded something to him. And he was wearing the paper clip ring she had made him OMG. Have we met before? he asks her. She tries to go away, to ignore him, to let him go but she cant, or he didnt let her. Then Day reaches out and touches my hand with his. He encloses it in a handshake. And just like that, I am linked with him again, I feel the pulse of our bond and his tory and love through our hands, like a wave of magic, the return of a longlost friend. Of something meant to be. The feeling brings tears to my eyes. Perhaps we can take a step forward together. Hi, he says. Im Daniel. Hi, I reply. Im June. I was so stunned by how this book ended. With the two of them meeting for the first time under normal circumstances well more like both of them REmeeting for the first time, June still having every memory of them and Day having just a glimpse of idea about who that girl is, just like they wondered what it would be like to meet each other like that in Prodigy. It was a beautiful parallel and it broke my heart more. I was so sad that June and Daniel lost 10 years that they could spend together but the important part is that they met AGAIN and they have a future together. It was a truly amazing book and I loved how Marie Lu ended this dystopian world. She couldnt have done a better job. i really do wish for a novella with the two of them being all cheesy and great and loving each other and saying what a good time they are having 23022014 first reaction Im crying I cant stop crying. What a beautiful ending, I cant believe what Marie Lu has done. A beautiful ending to a beautiful story. Thank you Marie Lu. I might write a proper review later because now I cant since Im crying and I cant think straight.
Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales Quick  Dirty: Awesome YA Paranormal book set in London in the 1800s. This was a great fast read with amazing characters and a great story. Opening Sentence: The demon exploded in a shower of inchor and guts. The Review: Tessa Greys life is about to change. Her aunt just recently passed away and her only family left is her brother Nate. He has been in London for a few years now and she decides it is time to join him. So she leaves New York and travels across the ocean to be with her brother. Upon arriving she is kidnapped by two witches who are called the Dark Sisters. London is full of werewolves, vampires, fairies, warlocks and other supernaturals known as downworlders. The Dark Sisters force Tessa to realize she is not totally human. It turns out she is a type of downworlder and a very rare one. She can take form of anyone she wants as long as she has something that belonged to that person. The Dark Sisters work for the mysterious Magister and Tessa is a big part of his evil plan. Fortunately, Tessa is rescued by a young Shadowhunter named Will. Shadowhunters are warriors that protect the world from demons and at times downworlders who are misbehaving. They have angel blood and are known as the Nephilim. Because they have angel blood in their system they are faster, stronger and can become invisible to humans. After Will rescues Tessa he takes her to the London institute which is a safe haven for all shadowhunters. While there she discovers that her brother is missing. She must find him but she will need the help of the shoadowhunters and she is a downworlder, but they dont know what kind. The Magister has a vendetta against the shadowhunters and would do anything to destroy them. He has created a mechanical army with one purpose to destroy the shadowhunters, but somehow Tessa is a big part of his plan. So in exchange for helping the shadowhunters with the Magister they agree to help Tessa find her brother. Tessa meets and befriends many of the shadowhunters at the institute. First there is the mysterious, gorgeous Will. Most of the time he is a total jerk to Tessa and pretty much everyone else as well. Then there are those rare occasions that he will let Tessa in and show her what an amazing person he really is. The only person Will seems to connect with and truly care about is his best friend and fellow shadowhunter Jem. Jem was cursed as a young man and they have yet to find a cure for it. The curse is slowly killing him and the only way they have found to slow it down is for Jem to take opium every day. The only problem with the drug is that it is also killing him just slower than the curse would. As Tessa gets to know the boys she starts to have feelings for both of them. On top of her boy problems she has to find her brother, figure out what she is, and try to stop the Magister. The characters in this book are amazing and I love each and every one of them. Tessa is a great heroine, she is strong and sensible. She is naive at times but she always tries to follow her heart wherever it may lead her. Will is a really interesting boy. He is totally beautiful but always so distant. He pushes everyone away, even those he cares about. There is great chemistry between Tessa and Will but the way he treats her most of the time is unacceptable. Then there is the always constant Jem. He is a total sweetheart with a heart made of gold. He quickly befriends Tessa and does all he can to help her. They stay mostly on the friend level in this book but there is hope for more in the books to come. Personally, I have to admit that I am Team Will in this book even though he can be a jerk, the times when he is open and shows what he can truly be like made me totally fall in love with him. The story in this book is amazing. It is nonstop action, betrayal, romance, and beautifully developed characters. Clares writing is flawless and so beautifully composed. I loved everything about this book from it being set in London in the 1800s which happens to be my favorite setting to the steamy romance, and amazing plot. If you havent read any of Cassandra Clares books you should totally start now. I have enjoyed everything she has written immensely. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys YA, I am pretty sure you will love it. Notable Scene: The change shattered like glass. With a cry Tessa fell to her knees, the torn little bow falling from her hand. It was her hand again  Emma had gone, like a castoff skin. Tessa was once more alone inside her own mind. Mrs. Blacks voice came from far away. Theresa? Where is Emma? Shes dead, Tessa whispered.  She died in an alley  bled to death. Good. Mrs. Dark exhaled a sound of satisfaction. Well done, Theresa. That was very good. Tessa said nothing. The front of her dress was splotched with blood, but there was no pain. She knew it was not her blood; it wasnt the first time this had happened. She closed her eyes, spinning in the darkness, willing herself to faint. FTC Advisory: Margaret K. McElderry BooksSimon  Schuster provided me with a copy of Clockwork Angel.

Joint review from Willow  Donna  The Romance Cover Shes mine. She always has been, she always will be. Willow: I can still remember when you convinced me to read the Opportunist, I had been putting off because I heard it was emotionally draining, but you said that it was one of the best books youd read so I had a go at it. I remember finishing it and being a little angry that I didnt get my HEA, but I started to think that both Caleb  Olivia were fked up and would only destroy one another if they were together, so I was actually really scared going into this one, especially when I saw the blurb saying Caleb was going to fight for her. I have always been team Caleb secretly but we can see Tarryn is so good at writing a big mess of a relationship. What where you thoughts before you started reading? Donna: I was nervous and reluctant, I had been waiting so LONGGGGGG for this book, I wanted my HEA for Caleb and Olivia, as you know I have always been team Caleb and knowing what a mind FK Tarryn likes to dish out I was anxious. It was a case of I so want to open this book now, dare I open this book now, is Tarryn going to kill me with this book....oh shit just open the damn book and start...so I did. Willow: Well we did have that conversation about me helping you bury Tarryn if we didnt get our HEA for them!!! Again this book had a different feel than TO  DR, and I think that its great all three books felt different to me, they all felt like their characters personality. TO was angst filled and difficult at times, DR was down right ugly and whilst Thief was not perfect it was more caring that the other two books. Donna: I think that we saw a very different side to Caleb in this book, whilst in TO although I wanted them to be together I thought he was a stupid selfish git at times and so tactless, yet in this book, through the past chapters we got to see the real Caleb, the real turmoil, his real thoughts and feelings and that just made me fall in love with him even more...all of their crap that was dished out, whilst was their own fault to some extent, layed firmly at the feet of Leah and despite everything she even tried again in this book Selfish, selfcentered Caleb Drake loved a girl so much he could already feel himself changing to accommodate her needs. I fell. Hard. For the rest of this life and probably the next. I wanted her  every last inch of her stubborn, combative, catty heart. Willow: My heart totally broke 100 times for Caleb in this book, he was trying so hard and I totally agree with you, I thought in previous books he was just as manipulative as Olivia and Leah well maybe not Leah  she is the queen of bitches but I too fell in love with Caleb in this one. God. I think of Olivia now and a peace settles over me. She might not be mine, but Im hers. Its no use even fighting it anymore. I just keep falling flat on my face and then rolling toward her. If I cant have Olivia Kaspen, then Ill be alone. She is a disease I have. After ten years, I am finally realizing that I cant cure it with other women Donna: My heart broke for Caleb a lot and I must admit I was getting pretty pissed at Olivia, she was giving out so many mixed signals to Caleb and then she would just go and break his heart all over again. I was worried when he went away for work as I thought that may have been the nail in the coffin but was glad that fate had other ideas It was a lie. I knew it was a lie, even as I said it. Ive never loved anyone after you. I never will. I walk out. Walk away. No more fighting  not for her, or with her, or with myself. I am so sad. Willow: I hated Olivia at one point! I choose him  you are right it was a roller coaster of up and downs for poor Caleb, as it always is with these two: Leah No, I say. I dont want to talk about Leah. Fine, she says. Wheres Noah? She looks away. Please stop asking me that. Why? Because it hurts to answer. I consider her for a moment and nod. Youre going to have to tell me eventually. Eventually. She sighs. That word is so us, isnt it? Eventually, youll tell me youre faking your amnesia. Eventually, Ill tell you that Im pretending not to know you. Eventually, well come back together, fall apart, come back together. Willow: Through the first part of the book I was wondering where Leah was. Then bam, everything she did after that kinda made up for her absence in the first part dont you think? Lets talk about Noah  I was convinced before going into Thief that there was something not right about him, I thought no one is that perfect and although we heard a bit more about him, I was actually disappointed there wasnt more. Donna: Like you I thought that there was something missing with him, whether it was like a set up or something...he just seemed too sugary sweet with bows and flowers, but actually he was actually that nice, he had his own demons to deal with, but if I was him, knowing my future wife was in love with another man, I couldnt have done it. Their marriage was doomed from the start especially when the other factors were thrown into the mix. My heart did break for Olivia in the epilogue, having been there and done that...but luckily for me, my outcome was so different, I was just so sad that mother nature took away that HEA for her. Willow: Yes the ending. As you know Im a cold hearted bitch, it takes a lot for me to cry at a book, and I did cry at Thief. It was like every time Tarryn gave us something good it was bitter sweet because she took something else away. In true Tarryn style it was heartbreaking and messy! Donna: This book was extremely emotional for me, but we needed to get inside Calebs head and Tarryn did it brilliantly. We got so many questions answered which we soooo needed. After getting these answers it just made me angry, if only they talked...then all this heart break could have been avoided, but then if they did talk we never would have got 3 amazing books...ying and yang and all that!! Willow: Totally agree! I loved this book, I felt it was a good ending to the trilogy. The way it has been written with each book told from each of the three personalities and even a bit from Noah was genius. I loved the back and forth between past and present. It was easy to read and brought out a lot of emotions, hurt, anger, betrayal and hate, but also hope, longing and love  however fked up that love was. But most of all it felt real, ok maybe an extreme side of real, but there was no insta love, they had to work hard for it. In real life love isnt always hearts and flowers, sometimes it is messy and Fcked up and Tarryn has certainly written about that alternative side of love. For me this was an easy 5 star read. Donna: I totally agree, love is never guaranteed and it is always a work in progress, you have to want it, nurture it, fight for it. It can be messy but if it was all hearts and flowers life would be incredibly boring. As you say, this is real life, maybe a bit extreme with Leahs shenanigans but very real none the less. I was glad they got a relative HEA in the end, despite the twist at the end, even though it was not the ending I would have liked. But, it was the ending that this trilogy deserved, it was never perfect, so a perfect ending would have done the book an injustice. With all that being said and having had time to reflect and digest and get my head round it, I will give it a 5 too, it deserves it!! Although that darn ending was just urgggghhhhhh, it needed to be done.
5 BIG HEARTBREAKING STARS There is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes so bad things. Wow this book. What an emotional journey. This was one of the hardest and most raw books Ive ever read. It was so real and riveting . I couldnt get enough of it. I couldnt stop reading yet I didnt want to keep reading. Such a different experience. Reading a Colleen Hoover book is like going through an eye opening journey and this one was no different and was one of the hardest but most worthwhile to battle through. All humans make mistakes. What determines a persons character arent the mistakes we make. Its how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuse. It was so sad but I cant begin to express enough how IMPORTANT this book is. Every female needs to read this. Every single girl should read this and understand the importance of this novel. Actually, everyone with a pulse should read this book. Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the wave have once been there, long after the tide recedes. That was what Atlas was telling me when he said I love you. He was letting me know that I was the biggest wave hed ever come across. And I brought so much with me that my impressions would always be there, even when the tide rolled out. The best way to fully grasps the importance of this story emotionally is to go into it blind. It follows Lily who meets this amazing neurosurgeon named Ryle and they fall head over heels in love. But Ryle has a dark past and that begins to interfere with their relationship in this worst way. Then Atlas, Lilys first love from when they were teenagers makes an appearance and everything Lily has been building gets shaken. Just because someone hurts you doesnt mean you can simply stop loving them. Its not a persons actions that hurt the most. Its the love. If there was no one attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear. The way that Colleen Hoover writes puts you right in the situation that Lily is in head first and makes you fall in love with both Ryle and Atlas. And its so twisted because of the kind of guy one of them turns out to be. Im sure you didnt miss me like I missed you, but sometimes the things that matter to you most are also the things that hurt you the most. And in order to get over that hurt, you have to sever all the extensions of my pain, so I guess that what I was doing. I was just trying to save myself a little bit of agony. In between this passionate love story thats going on with Ryle and Lily we get these sweet innocent flashbacks of a life with a sixteen year old Lily and Atlas. Atlas who is this homeless boy who finds hope and a home in Lily. And Lily who is living a nightmare of home life and seeks comfort in him. Those stories were my favorite. Lily, he whispers, still holding me tightly. I know this is the last thing you need to hear right now. But I have to say it because Ive walked away from you too many times without saying what I really want to say. He pulls back to look down at me and when he sees my tears, he brings his hands up to my cheeks.In the future...if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again...fall in love with me. He presses his lips against my forehead. Youre still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be. But I still loved the blooming relationship between her and Ryle. Ryle who is arrogant, smart, charismatic. These are two VERY different relationships and the deeper we dig into the relationship with Lily and Ryle the harder that relationship becomes and the tougher it is to read. Maybe love isnt something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flow, in and out, just like the people in our lives. Just because we didnt up on the same wave, doesnt mean we arent apart of the same ocean. Two other very important relationships is the friendship she has with Allysa, who I loved! Her and Marshall were amazing friends and their interactions were so much fun to read. The other significant relationship was between Lily and her mother. I loved, loved their scenes together, especially the last one! Sometimes even grown women need their mothers comfort so we can just take a break from having to be strong all the time. Then the cuteness of the Dear Ellen letters. just keep swimming All in all, this was definitely the most important Colleen Hoover book and is a complete MUST READ. I laughed, I cried happy tears then a lot of sad tears. Then the authors note at the end just breaks your heart even more. So many times I had to close the book and walk away because this book makes you feel so many different emotions and at times, not the good kind. But on the other hand, this book definitely has the power to save lives and give some girls the strength they need to make the hard choice and walk away. Thank you Colleen Hoover for sharing your families naked truth with us by being brave and bold. Truly an unforgettable love story. Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet. My mother went through it. I went through it. Ill be damned if I allow my daughter to go through the it. I kiss her on the forehead and make her a promise. It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.
6 BAM stars! The world keeps spinning because your heartbeats exist. Wow. Wow. Wow. Brittainy C. Cherry has once again moved me so completely that I am left utterly speechless. There is just something about this book; its different than what I thought it would be, not that I knew exactly what to expect, but it was so much more. The intense emotion that is portrayed in The Silent Waters rocked my world. It is both heartbreaking and breathtakingly beautiful, and even though this was difficult story to read and the pain felt so real, Brittainys gorgeous storytelling healed my heart, made it soar, and filled my soul with love and happiness. The Silent Waters is a magnetic force that pulled me in and refused to let me go. I am still reeling from this story days later. This book was pure magic and I loved every single thing about it!! I wont go into the plot because I think it is best to go into this book blind. Just know that there are so many feelings packed in these pages that it is impossible not to be affected by the words. The story was addictive and very hard to put down. It left me with a huge book hangover of the best kind and I can not stop thinking about Brooks and Maggie. Each time I try to move on, I find myself wanting to dive right back in to relive their story over and over again. I smiled, I laughed, I cried, and I loved. My heart beat wildly out of excitement, out of fear, and out of anticipation. There were times when my body shook, my palms sweated, my breath hitched, and when it came to the end, happy tears streamed down my face and my heart was so full. This book truly has all the feels you can want and more. Brittainy created welldeveloped and complex characters that touched my heart and will forever have a place it in. They are easily relatable, interesting, unique and oh so lovable. They were perfectly imperfect in every way and I seriously adored them. This story is made up of moments and every single one was important to Brooks and Maggies story and who they were together as well as who they were when they are apart  they were wonderful individually, but they were fantastic together. Brittainy captured the beauty of a pure, young, first love, and it gave me goosebumps and had me smiling from ear to ear. Though they were meant to be together, no matter how hard they tried, it never seemed to be the right time. Brooks and Maggie had to fight for their relationship. They had to be patient and personally grow, and it wasnt easy on them or the people around them. Eventually decisions needed to be made. Decisions that hurt and broke my heart, decisions that showed me the depth of love. In that moment, I knew she had been right about everything all along. She was right about me, and her, and us. Shed be the one girl Id love until forever. No matter how life tried to change us. Maggies character was fantastic and I loved her from the very first page. She was sweet, innocent, optimistic and had a pure soul. Brittainy described Maggie as a child so well and then continued to capture her loving personality into adulthood. There was nothing about her to dislike. She had such a beautiful heart and when a tragedy occurred that changed Maggies life forever, her pain and fear broke me. I cried for her and with her. I understood her and her coping methods and what she had to do the survive. She was brave but it still hurt. She was not alone though; Brooks stood by her side. Ill be your anchor. Ill help you stay grounded when you feel like you are drifting away. Brooks. dreamy sigh What can I say about Brooks? He was absolutely amazing and may be my favorite hero of Brittainys. His heart was huge, his support unending, his friendship true, and his love everlasting. His feelings for Maggie ran so deep and he always put her first. Brooks was the only one who heard Maggie when she didnt say a word and I love how he truly knew who she was and what she needed. I need you to know that even if you decide to never speak again, youll always have someone around to hear you...Ill always be there there to listen to your silence. I loved the drive and persistence Brooks had when doing the things he loved. I loved that Maggie was never far from his mind and he made my heart swell whenever he was around. When Brooks was faced with his struggles, my heart broke. I understood what he was going through and felt his pain. I loved the support and commitment Maggie showed him; she was there for him just as he was there for her and it was beautiful. Each one of the wonderful side characters in this book played an important role in Maggie and Brooks life and I loved them all. Maggies father was loving and supportive. He was a constant in life and never gave up on her. Maggies relationships with Cheryl and Calvin were heartwarming and the bandmates made me smile. The support system that each character created proved that love can heal and prevail even when the odds are against you. I loved the importance of music in the book. Brooks was passionate about music and he shared it with Maggie. Music was Maggies escape, and Brooks always knew exactly what to play and had a way of making things better when Maggie felt overwhelmed. I loved the shout out to Romeos Quest too. 3 The Silent Waters was simply amazing and this epic romance is easily one of my favorite 2016 reads!! A person never reads an outstanding book twice and walks away with the same beliefs. An outstanding book always surprises you and awakens you to new ideas, new ways of looking at the world, no matter how many times the words have been read.

The past doesnt belong to us anymore, and the future is just a fantasy, never guaranteed. But the present is ours to own. The only way we can realize that fantasy is if we embrace the now. Holy shit, I dont even have words to describe how much I loved this book. I just finished it a few minutes ago and I have that amazing giddy, excited feeling after I finish reading an incredible story that is a new all time favorite. Honestly this book was like a modern, more erotic version of The Notebook, with more relatable characters. Matt and Grace are both incredible characters and they are my new OTP for life. I cant even express how hard I ship them in words, they are so cute and so perfect for each other in every way. And Im a sucker for a story about first loves finding their way back to each other. As they say, theres no love like the first love. Poetry is just evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash. The premise of this book is what intrigued me right away. Matt writes a lost connections ad on Craigslist when he sees Grace on a subway in New York, and the reader is left wondering how they met and what happened with them. This book is told in past and present tense and from Matt and Graces perspectives. The past tense chapters were so adorable, as you watch Grace and Matt in their college days, meeting each other and falling in love with each other. Grace is a cellist and Matt is a photographer who has dreams of working for National Geographic. He likes to take pictures of Grace, and she plays the cello for him all the time. They were so young and in love and just insanely adorable to read about. I found myself laughing and crying and I loved every bit of it. They were both poor and they both had family issues, but their love for each other pulled them through it all and it was so sweet. Then, the present chapters take place fifteen years later, when Matt and Grace are 36 years old and they saw each other on the subway. This book went way deeper than I was expecting it to and all the emotions these characters had felt so real. While reading Matts chapters, the way he talked about Grace and how much he missed her literally made my heart ache for him. He talked about how she looked fragile and had a childlike innocence about her and her long blond wavy hair, and I could just picture her in my head so easily. I could also easily imagine Matt being young and adorable in his younger years and growing up into a handsome, tall, sexy man as she mentions his stronger jaw line and trim of facial hair. Towards the last half of this book there is such a big plot twist that I didnt see coming and it made the book that much better. I was planning on giving this book 4.5 stars up until that plot twist that changed everything and made my heart hurt like hell and made it very worthy of 5 stars. And I dont give out 5 stars often. I was so shocked and heart broken and had all these intense feelings, it was incredible. I love when an author can do that to me, make me feel so invested in the story that even I react in a way the main character does as if it were my real life situation. Its very rare that this happens for me. There are also beautiful passages throughout the book that are extremely relatable like this one: The first time someone young and vibrant dies someone you look up to, someone you relate to it blows you back, right off your feet. Oh, fuck, were all gonna die, nobody knows when, nobody knows how, you think. And in that moment you realize how little control you have over your own destiny. From the time youre born, you have no control; you cant choose your parents, and unless youre suicidal, you cant choose your death. The only things you can do is choose the person you love, be kind to others, and make your brutally short stint on earth as pleasant as possible. Like wow, that quote really took my breath away. I have never experienced death first hand, but I get what she is talking about. And thats so true and its a sad realization. Like nothing else is life, sex is perfectly selfless and selfish all at once. Hot and cold, yin and yang, black and white, and all the shades in between. Finally, the whole world made sense. I was in on the secret now. During the entire length of the novel I was pulling for Matt and Gracie to find their way back to each other and be together and be happy. Their pain rolled off in waves and I could feel it, just reading their words. As adults they felt like too much time had passed for it to work out, but I desperately wanted it to. Watching them find their way back to each other was such a beautiful thing to see. This book reminded me of The Notebook because of how young they were when they first got together and then how there had been miscommunication between the two, and then later in life they find a way to reconnect. Although I will say, even though this book seems to have a Nicholas Sparks feel and setup it is so much better and realistic and modern than his books. Matt and Grace didnt feel like cookie cutter Nicholas Sparks characters, they felt real. This writing kind of reminded me of my love for Unteachable by Leah Raeder, which is arguably one of my favorite love stories of all time. It just had the same flow and I havent experienced that desperate need for the characters to get back together since Unteachable. And I actually loved both Matt and Grace equally, which is another thing I havent experienced in a love story since Unteachable. Grace is smart and talented and innocent but confident at the same time. Shes everything I would like to be. And Matt is funny, he as a weird sense of humor, but hes also sincere, and caring and everything I love in a male character. They are both so perfect for each other, it makes my heart hurt. And then his lips were on mine and we were in it, pulling away from the past and rushing fast into the future. I really love this book. I cant wait to reread it again. I already want to start rereading it again now. Its easily an all time favorite of mine and one of my favorite books from 2015. This is the first book Ive ever read from Renee Carlino and I will certainly check out all of her other books after this incredible story. Matt and Gracie will always have a place in my heart, as will their beautiful story.
Basically, I have just one word for this incredible debut novel: BRILLIANT. Of course, I have many more words of praise for it, but this one word really sums up my most heartfelt reaction to it. As a longtime Sherlock Holmes fan, I immediately felt attracted to this book. The original Conan Doyle stories are exciting, with very complex crimes which, of course, makes the stories as fascinating as they are. Holmes is an eccentric detective whose personal flaws are just as interesting as his genius for solving difficult cases, just with the highly observant, deductive power of his mind. And Watson is the perfect, faithful partner, willing to follow Holmes to the bitter end. He is also the excellent chronicler of all the cases he and Holmes work on. This novel brings back all those things that made Sherlock Holmes such an iconic character  in the person of his great, great, great granddaughter, Charlotte. I LOVED that, when creating her own version of the original detective duo, Cavallaro chose to make Sherlocks genius detective descendant Charlotte, instead of James. Weve already had enough of young women adoringly admiring confident male heroes. The tables are turned here! We definitely need more daring, logicallyinclined female detectives in fiction! Charlotte Holmes is just as quirky, and just as much of a detective genius, as her formidable ancestor. She even shares his fondness for violin playing, as well as his unfortunate attraction to drugs, although her drug of choice is OxyContin. However, like her ancestors favorite drug, cocaine, OxyContin is a derivative of opium. James Watson, the boy who meets and becomes Charlottes partner, is the original Watsons descendant, too. Like him, James becomes an indispensable ally to his own Holmes, in her quest to solve puzzling crimes. This alliance is made rather complex by the fact that this Holmes is a female. Jamie Watson has feelings for Charlotte, which, toward the end of the novel, hes more and more willing to accept. Charlotte has feelings for him as well, but is much more reticent, in keeping with her temperament, which is a lot like that of her famous ancestor. Also like his own ancestor, James Watson is the chronicler of his adventures with Charlotte Holmes. His narrative is just as matter of fact, but just as perceptive. Through his eyes, we see just what a great detective Charlotte is. He describes her personality in detail, and admits to being baffled by its eccentricities. Still, he cant help but be fascinated, and enjoys working with her. The case here is not only exciting, but also hits too close to home. Holmes and Watson have been framed for murder. The fact that the victim harassed Holmes on several previous occasions, and was confronted by Watson during one of them, makes things look very bad for our two heroes. Like the original Holmes, Charlotte is on the case immediately. She has been able to arrange to have her own crime lab, where, with Watsons help, she begins to follow clues and come to conclusions. Like Sherlock, she comes up with the craziest notions but they only appear crazy on the surface, testing them through flawless logic, and then following through on them. She is totally unpredictable, frequently taking her partner by surprise when she suddenly goes off on a dangerous, but effective, course of action. All this goes down while the pair are students at a private Connecticut boarding school. They have to deal not only with the suspicions of the police, but the taunts and even hatred of their own classmates, while negotiating the challenges of adolescence, as well. In the process, Jamie as he is known to most people, to his great chagrin reconnects with his estranged father, and discovers that things are not quite as he had thought they were. The plot is diabolically PERFECT. Cavallaro references famous Sherlock Holmes cases such as A Study In Scarlet, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle, and others. She interweaves clues related to these cases into her own plot in a very skillful manner that is reminiscent of Conan Doyles own great storytelling. The descendants of the famous detective duo are very welldeveloped characters. They work together beautifully. They brainstorm. They argue. They follow the inexorable, logical train of thought of the Holmesian mind. They are just enchanting! Here are some samples of typical interchanges: I stuffed my hands in my pockets to keep myself from fidgeting. Do you want me to try to lie to you? At that, I watched Holmes fight back a laugh. God, no, that would be pointless. No, Ill make a series of statements and you can tell me which are true. Thumb up for truth, thumb down for a lie.  Because, somewhere in that brain of yours, youve decided I should know more about you, but you dont want to do it outright. No, it cant be simple, youre Charlotte Holmes. You have to do it sideways, and this is the most sideways approach you could dream up.  This is completely unfair, I pointed out. It is. Holmes smiled to herself. We can talk more at the poker game tonight. No ones going to come. Everyone thinks were murderers. Everyone will come, she said, correctly, because everyone thinks were murderers.  I was delighted to once again feel the excitement of the original tales, as the 21st century Holmes and Watson took up the chase, followed all leads, and, most of all, came to incredible deductive conclusions, almost as if by magic, thanks to Charlotte. All Sherlockian fans will be absolutely fascinated and pleased by Cavallaros masterful use of the original material created by Conan Doyle. Readers who love the YA genre will be doubly pleased, as the author also seamlessly weaves teen angst into the plot. I need to do some fangirling of this novel! I need to say how very MUCH I LOVE IT!! I did not want it to end..... I was fascinated, spellbound, addicted, compelled to read, totally and completely immersed in this great story that is such a tribute to the original Holmes and Watson! I have long loved these two, and now I love their descendants just as much!! If youre a Sherlockian, you really MUST read this novel. You will get your Holmes and Watson fix, no doubt about it! Of course, I have already preordered the sequel, The Last of August, and hope that Cavallaro will turn this trilogy into a longlasting series, just as Conan Doyle did with his own immortal characters!

I want to start off by saying that while I am a fan of Clare and her work I try not to encourage the extreme hype and controversy that surrounds her. However, Lady Midnight deserves all of the praise it gets. Expertly crafted, beautifully written, and surprisingly dark, Clare weaves a magical mystery with family drama and romantic drama seamlessly. Her writing has improved so much its astounding. I have stayed up all night finishing this. More thoughts when Im not half dead! Okay, Ive slept a few more hours and I am ready to begin. Warning, there wont be heavy spoilers but I will be revealing little details about characters so if you dont want to know anything about the book, dont read. It is NOT necessary to read TMI, TID, The Bane Chronicles, and Tales of the Shadowhunter Academy in order to read Lady Midnight but you WILL be spoiled for certain events that happened in these books except for TBC and TotSA. I highly recommend reading them because they are awesome I personally love TID and TotSA the most and because youll understand certain inside jokes in the book. As you can tell from the synopsis, this takes place five years after the events of TMI. Its 2012 and we follow Emma Carstairs and the Blackthorns  Cristina as they try to solve the murders in Los Angeles of both mundanes and fae, and who Emma believes to be behind the murders of her parents. A fae convoy comes and says that in exchange for the LA institutes help they will let Mark choose to either stay with his family or return to the Wild Hunt. Lady Midnight is part detective story, part family drama, with plenty of romance and magic. We meet new characters who I LOVE. Honestly, I love the Blackthorns, Emma, and Cristina. I love their dynamic and how close their family is. They are ruthless. Namely, Julian. Hes had to take care of four kids since he was 12. Yeah, Uncle Arthur is there but theres something about him that is pretty much useless when it comes to the kids. In the wake of their fathers death, Helens exile, and Marks capture by the Hunt, Julian is essentially their father. Emma has been by his side the whole time and shes watched him learn how to take care of young Tavvy, cook, clean, buy groceries, etc. all while easing their nightmares. Hes had to grow up very quickly and there is nothing he wouldnt do to keep his family together, nothing. He wanted to be parabatai with Emma because he was so afraid the Clave would send her away to the Academy, and he needed Emma to stay. Emma is his rock, and its understandable. They are childhood friends who would do anything for each other. And they are certainly NOT a new JaceWill or ClaryTessa. Their personalities are wholly unique and it was great being in the minds of kids who knew who their parents were, have grown up in the Shadowhunter world all their lives, and live in the aftermath of a war. The plot is amazing. You have the overarching plot of solving the murders and finding out whos behind them for Emmas parents and hopefully getting Mark back. Then you have the subplots of Emma and Julians feelings for each other, Kieran  Mark  Cristina  Diego and that whole fiasco, and whether or not Mark will actually choose to stay. Lemme tell you, I was actually suspicious of Diana for quite awhile. She disappears on her own for long periods of time, shes obviously done something illegal, and she holds a lot of secrets. It took me awhile to figure out whos behind everything, and I was pretty sad. It is honestly a pretty heartbreaking story. I think what I love most about the book is how diverse it is. Cristina is Mexican, Diana is black, Mark is bisexual like Helen, and Ty is confirmed by Cassandra to have autism. I wish he could get the professional help he needs. Arthur is obviously mentally ill. Hearing about other shadowhunters who have dyslexia, depression, ADHD etc. and getting hidden away is just so sad. For everything the Clave can do they are not progressive people. They should know that mundanes have medical help for them and should see them as just any other illness that should be treated. I really hope this will be explored more as the trilogy continues, especially with Ty. I do love all of the support he gets from his family, especially from Julian. Marks sexuality isnt really a big thing to him, its just a part of who he is and Im so glad because thats how it should be. Honestly, I love how Clare was so influenced by Annabel Lee took Poes poem and turned it into a shadowhunter thing. The English Lit nerd part of me who loves Poe realized the chapter titles were lines from Annabel Lee and I got so happy. Clare weaves the poem into the plot so well, its amazing. I also loved how Clare hinted that Poe somehow found out about Malcolm and Annabels story and thats who the poem is based off of. SHIPPING MARK AND CRISTINA SO HARD. I just love how Cristina grounds Mark, especially in the beginning when he was readjusting to the human world and being around his family. I dunno, I just have such a soft spot for Mark. Hes been through so much, and I just want him to be happy. Diego is a dummy and can go away because honestly if he really loved Cristina he would have defended her to Jaime. Also, his brother Jaime sounds like a sociopath if he really has no compassion and empathy in his heart. Im really hoping everyone works their love lives out. Emma and Julian need to be saved somehow and Mark and Cristina need to be together. The whole parabatai problem is obviously very worrisome, and Im hoping there will be SOMETHING to make this all work out in two books. As for Kit, I knew there was something about him that had to be important since he has a POV. Once he started doing cool moves I was like okay this kid is the lost Herondale. And then Jem and Tessa come in and are awesome together. I really think Kit and Ty will be a thing because remember, far in the future Clare said The Wicked Powers will be about two gay shadowhunters in love and I have a feeling it will be about them. There is a big emphasis on family in this, and I love it. Exploring Julian and Marks relationship, their roles have essentially reversed. When Mark was taken, he was the older one in charge who knew how to take care of the kids. Now, his time in Faerie has made him forget how to care for them and be stern with them, thats Julians role now. You can see they really love each other, but Julian gets frustrated by Mark and how hes not how he expected him to be which is sad. That whipping scene! Oh man, broke my heart. I sobbed. And then with that last chapter things will clearly not get better. Oh Mark, you just had to say it. And Emma may just go through with it because its not like she can explain why she wants a pretend boyfriend and ughh this is not gonna go well. Everyone has such unique personalities, but they all work together so well. Things I want exploredanswered: More knowledge on the parabatai thing, MORE JEM AND TESSA we barely saw them and I was hoping they would be more involved with Emma and co., Dianas secrets, Cristinas history and past with Diego and Jaime, mental illness among shadowhunters, Kit and his perhaps budding friendship with Ty, how Livvy will feel about this, and the aftermath of that Why lie? and epilogue. I just knew that epilogue was gonna happen, I knew it! Also, I refuse to believe Malcolm is dead until I see the body. Honestly, I think what you realize the most above all is that for the Blackthorns and Emma, family is everything. Oh, one more thing! THAT SPECIAL STORY AT THE END. SIMON AND IZZY ARE ENGAGED!!!! MY BABIES ARE OKAY!!!!! JACE PROPOSED TO CLARY BUT WE DONT KNOW IF SHE WILL SAY YES!!! Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Clares writing is spectacular and the characters are amazing. I still love TID the most, but who knows I may change my mind yet. Damn this is a long review... so sorry guys lol. Oh I almost forgot. Mark, youre a book boyfriend.
Great followup to Emerge, full review to come with my tour stop on 101. FULL REVIEW Seeing Laney in Algebra every week is gonna suck, and Im not sure how long Ill be able to treat her with cold indifference; it just doesnt feel right. We were friends for so long before we were anything else, but Im not sure yet if we can get it back there. Not having her in my life at all is foreign and hurts like hell, but Im not sure I can pull off anything more than cordial distance right now, and the cordiality is sometimes a stretch. Evan Allen is having a hard time dealing with his new reality. Chasing the girl he loves has blown up in his face when his rash decision to change his entire life plan is pretty much rejected; Laney chose Dane. Laney loves Dane. Evan is now the one who has to start over, his heart broken, in a new school where he will now have to see her regularly, with a new team that he is benched for, and new friends. Everyone has been cool with him so far, especially Sawyer; keeping Evan in drinks and women as much as he will allow in a feeble attempt to get back in the saddle so to speak. No sense in wallowing over what is obviously never going to happen. Evan goes through the motions, but never really lets himself go in order to fully find happiness again; it just hurts too much right now and everything is too confusing...and then he meets Whitley Thompson. Whitley is the girl we all wanted to hate in Emerge. She hangs on Dane and Laney cant stand her. Beautiful, blonde with sparkling blue eyes and a petite figure, Whitley is the complete opposite of Laney in all the ways that matter. She, too, is just trying to find her place. Evan knows that there is something different about her and is immediately drawn to her delicate smile, kind words and constant humming. Somehow, Whitley is exactly what Evan needs to move forward; problem is, hes scared that she may just be a rebound...I mean who finds their one in the first girl they meet after the supposed one rips your heart out? I have a ton of fun with you. Everything does not go to shit when you show up, so dont believe that. Youre beautiful and kind and Ill hang with you anytime you want....My eyes bore into hers, never straying, as I let the gravity of it all sink in. Practically strangers, stoned, and yet we connected profoundly over the same moment in timea random act of chasing a deflated balloon around a parking lot...We make no specific plans to hang out again, but something tells me we will. I have no idea what shes thinking, Im not even sure what Im thinking, but I do fall asleep with a smile. This doesnt go over with Laney too well... Her best friend in the entire world not only wants nothing to do with her, but is now taking up with the one girl on campus that Laney cannot stand; threatened to take a bat to on their very first meeting. This cannot be good! But what right does she have to dictate who Evan spends his time with, and that does get Whitley off of Dane... enter clever smirk here. Adjusting just isnt easy when she knows shes no longer the girl Evan needs, not that she can really complain anyway, she made her choice and is happy in that decision. Maybe, just maybe, Laney misjudged Whitley and will have to give her a chance. Whitley does something to Evan that he never expected. In just her little ways, she slowly starts to heal him. He finds himself more and more drawn to her, and as much as he wants to just remain friends for fear of messing up yet another relationship, he cannot deny that she calls to him on a level deeper than that. Ever the romantic, Evan knows that if hes going to make a move, it has to be the right one or he will end up right where he started... When the last note eases from her mouth, the crowd explodes around us. It was a moving performance, words unable to describe what it meant to know that it was for me. I step to the stage and offer her my hand, which she takes with a timid smile. Her small hand in mine, I help her down and wrap her in a hug. Youre really good Whitley, that was amazing, I exhale in her ear. Im glad you liked it. I sang it for you. It was perfect. My cheek rubs against hers as I nod my head; I knew who she was singing to. Who knows, maybe shes gonna be the one who saves me. We are all searching for that onceinalifetime kind of love. Someone who completes the other half of our soul. Age has nothing to do with when your heart is ready and speaking from experience, the age old saying when you know, you know rings true. Loving someone and being in love with someone are totally different although sometimes its hard to differentiate the two. Learning the differences and experiencing both come in various forms. Thank you, S.E. Hall for showing the differences and that one can truly have both...its just about learning the differences. What Ive always wanted. Someone to meet me halfway, to be the half of my team. A bubble of our own that no bursts through, where were equally important to one another, we both know it, we both trust it, putting it before all else. When I lean in to kiss her, shes already up on her toes to grab it and give it back to me, with passion. When I walk in a room, she smiles like her day just got better, and my eyes seek and find her first in the crowd. Honestly, I dont really ever compare the two, but I do realize something now. With Laney, I put her up on a pedestal, then spent all my time trying to get her to come down and see me. Whitley walked right up to me, out of anyone and everyone in the room, and asked me to sit beside her. Shes been right beside me, literally, ever since. Evan is just your AllAmerican country boy. He is gentle and kind, a true gentleman. I loved him in Emerge and I am so glad he got his own story with Embrace. I love the multiple POVs in this story and Hall again doesnt disappoint with how everything plays out. The crew as a whole are a great group and I really cannot wait to see what happens, there are some very fine men in this series and deserve to be heard hint hint while still keeping up with all the people we have grown to love thus far. This series is one I will absolutely recommend as a lighthearted, lovely, coming of age, yet growing up although the same, totally different kind of story. There is just enough of the hard stuff to keep it from being fluffy and I love the little extras in the back stories that I have learned as the series has progressed. Hall is wonderful storyteller and her tender scenes between family or friends is just as poignant as her steamy love scenes and chemistry between her couples. I laughed out loud more times than I can count and there were times when my eyes teared up so much I couldnt see the page...yes, Im an emotional reader; and this book gave me everything I wanted. 4.5 True Country Gentleman Stars
I received a free advance reading copy of this book through Goodreads First Reads. FTC guidelines: check! In the book blurb, The Last One is compared to Station Eleven and The Passage neither of which I liked very much. I thought Station Eleven was boring and The Passage is the Game of Thrones of dystopian literature, it goes on and on and on... Unlike the other two titles, I think that The Last One got the mix of action to number of characters just right. If I had to pick the book that I think its most like, I would compare it to Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood but with far more likeable characters and a much more optimistic world view. The Last One is told through a first person, present narrative and a third person flashback, alternating viewpoints between chapters. I was a bit frustrated with that set up until the timelines began to converge towards the end of the book, because Oliva kept putting in foreshadowing, but then not delivering on it until a couple chapters later just long enough for me to completely forget about it. Im much more of an instant gratification kind of reader, but I managed to push through it and really started to enjoy the novel despite the style of storytelling. Mixing reality television with the end of the world was brilliant because the mind set of the people in the reality shows is already in survival of the fittestgame mode. I completely believed the mental breakdown that Zoo suffered when she tried to figure out where the game ended and reality began. She was put in a situation where she wasnt supposed to know what was going on and then, she didnt even know when exactly, no one knew what was going on. This type of world ending felt much more believable than the descent into chaos in World War Z or Station Eleven because of that slow transition to a different world provided by the reality tv show setting. Also, anyone whos ever watched reality tv will immediately grasp the archtypical roles that Oliva uses to label her characters and it makes it simple to keep a rather large group of people straight in your mind. Fans of Big Brother, Top Chef, The Jersey Shore, and any of the countless other offerings of that genre will eat this up. What I loved most about this book is that it was so easy to put myself in Zoos shoes. In this passage, shes talking about her reluctance to go on the show: It didnt used to be so difficult to leave, but it was different before I met my husband. Before leaving Stowe for college, that summer hiking hostel to hostel across western Europe, six months in Australia after graduating from Columbia my fear was always tempered by excitement enough to tip the scales. Leaving was always scary, but it was never hard. But this time I not only left familiarity behind, I left happiness. Theres a difference, the magnitude of which I didnt anticipate. advance reader, pg 2425 Cooper, aka Tracker, was also so relatable. He reminded me of various people that I have known in my real life: Cooper was kind of like that at first. Standoffish. I dont know what drew me to him so strongly from the start. No I do. His air of almost freakish competence. The way he scanned each of us, assessing without looking for allies, because from the moment he leapt into that tree it was clear he didnt need anyone but himself. I bet his entire adult life has been like that: needing no one, being needed by no one existing without apology and accomplishing wonders. Id never been around someone so supremely independent before and was fascinated. advance reader, pg 38 The reality show mentality begins: Waitresss animosity doesnt surprise Exorcist, but Ranchers agreement does, as do the many nodding heads around the campfire. Briefly, he looks into a camera lens, as though accusing the device of having put the others up to this. Indeed, thats exactly what hes doing; he thinks theyre performing like he is. But the truth is most of the contestants have in this moment forgotten that theyre being recorded. An ancient instinct is kicking in, not so much a survivalofthefittest mentality as an unwillingness to carry an able but lazy individual. advance reader, pg 174 Zoos confusion between reality and reality television makes for some really intense, introspective moments: I wonder how Im being portrayed now. I know what my role was when we started. I was the earnest animal lover, always cheerful and up for a Challenge. But now? Will they cast me as off my rocker? Probably not; thats Randys role, with his stupid gold cross and his tales of possessed toddlers. But whoever I am now, Im no longer who I was. I wonder if I can even do that anymore, be that person grinning until her cheeks ache. It was exhausting, as exhausting as this endless trekking, in its own way. advance reader, pg 185 After awhile, I started to wonder if Zoo would ever accept what was really happening to her or choose to keep soldiering on and never come back from the world that she was building in her head. I liked her enough though, that I was cheering for her sanity, every step of the way. Thats the sign of a good book, I think. For all the women out there who didnt change their name at marriage, like me, like Zoo:After I cross the overgrown lawn, I will stand on the woven welcome mat a gift from my motherinlaw.... our mat has my husbands surname stitched on it. Not mine. My motherinlaw never accepted that I didnt change my name. We made a joke of it and Sharpied my name on there too under his, but bigger. advance reader, pg 206. I have some relatives like that too cant let other people get you down. Its not their life or their name, is it? Finally, I loved this moment, when Zoos happy mask begins to crack on the television show and how shes received: Waitress is shocked, as are Rancher and the camerman. The producers will be shocked too, and the editor, who will work so hard to explain away this moment. But there is at least one viewer who wont be shocked: Zoos husband. He knows this secret competitive side of her, her impatience for wallowing and delay. He also knows how fear can turn her mean. advance reader, pg 221. Ah marriage, the ultimate reality show. Theres a lot more to The Last One that Im not going to talk about here because I dont want to spoil anything for anyone. Its a great book. I recommend it for readers who enjoy dystopians, for television watchers who enjoy reality shows, and for anyone who has ever wondered about their capacity to survive the end of the world. Could you be as strong as Zoo? Could I? I wonder...
Actual rating: 3.5 Initially I was putting off reading this series because I am not huge on the whole cyborg thing. I didnt know if I was going to connect with a cyborg MC and if the whole futuristic setting would do it for me. I normally prefer fantasy. I like my knights. I like my magic. I like my pseudoMedieval setting. With scifi and anything that comes close to it you expect science and technology, which are things I dont particularly care about. The Lunar Chronicles is a strange mix of both: there is magic even though it is closer to the Force, Star Wars style, as a principle instead of your typical fantasy magic and there is technology. Unfortunately or fortunately?, the whole time I was picturing the use of magic like this: As far as reading habits go, I have long learned the lesson that I have to try out new things and sometimes books I have initially dismissed turn out to be quite enjoyable if I give them a chance. So...I gave this book a chance even though only because my local bookstore didnt have anything new and I just picked it up out of ...boredom, I guess. Now, briefly : The things I loved: the setting, the backstory, the fast pacing  Cinder. The things I didnt quite love: Prince Kais overall awesomeness  the fact that the setting was awesome, but the worldbuilding wasnt more detailed because the potential was huge. See? If those aspects of the book were more developed, it would have been one hell of a novel. Everybody loves a snarky, sarcastic heroine, right? At least I do. I prefer them this way to the kindhearted, beautiful and sweetly naive MCs we normally get. However, it is a problem when sarcasm overrides all other reactions and the heroine acts as a spoilt teen. There is a fine line between being funnily sarcastic and spoilt, and Cinder, unfortunately, gravitates between the two states. Not always, but frequently enough to make me notice. The spoilt and unpleasant state is most obvious when it comes to her communication with Dr. Erland: Cinder tilted her head. Dont they pay you enough for corrective eye surgery? I like the way these feel. Dr. Erland dragged the holograph down, revealing the inside of Cinders head. Speaking of eye surgery, do you realize youre missing tear ducts? What? Really? And I thought I was just emotionally withdrawn. She pulled her feet up, hugging her knees. Im also incapable of blushing, if that was going to be your next brilliant observation. On the other hand, when left alone she is quite pleasant and as weird as that sounds, human. Yes, that is one of her most predominant characteristics: being human. I know some people had a problem with this considering she is a cyborg, however it wasnt an issue for me. True, she has some mechanic parts, however, she still is human, her mind, her emotions, everything is human. She is not an android: she was born and raised, felt emotions and built a character. Which in my book makes her human. Of course, everybody is free to interpret this as they like considering we dont really have cyborgs in real life. Particularly for me, I shouldnt have worried about the cyborg part to begin with but you know, pride and prejudice. Another impressive thing is that unlike the original Cinderella, our MC is not an overworked silly bimbo, who just takes every bullshit her stepmother  sisters throw at her. Cinder is overworked, but she realises that she does not deserve the horrible attitude she gets. I do appreciate the fact that we didnt get a Disneystyle heroine at all. Since the book is almost solely focused on Cinder, the rest of the characters  prince Kai, Dr. Erland, Adri, Peony, Pearl, Queen Levana  are not really that developed. True, we get some chapters from prince Kais POV, however they are not enough to help us build a complete image of him as a character. It is a bit onesided  the wellintending, handsome prince who is looking for a way to save his people. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but it would have been nice to get some flaw or some dark secret or ... something not that knightinshiningarmor style. I prefer my heroes grey, not all black and white. The mystery surrounding Cinders origins was quite obvious from page 41 my edition , but somehow this didnt reduce the level of interest I took in the plot. I usually get really pissed off when I read something predictable.I take it as a sign that the author is underestimating hisher readers and their intelligence  along with the quite simple ability to put two and two together. However, in this particular case I think the main emphasis was not on Cinders mysterious background, but more on what role her life would play in the fate of the Earth dramatic music ON from now on. And this makes the predictable part of the plot OK. For me, at least. Now, in regards to the setting and the fact that it wasnt as developed as I would have liked. There was only a brief mention of World War IV and I was left wondering what exactly happened, how the world turned out as it did. I enjoyed the setting very much  the only Asianinspired setting Ive read in a fantasyscifi novel was Daniel Abrahams Long Price Quartet, so I was quite happy with the different outlook we got here. Meyers imagination and creativity  amazing. I really do hope in the other books we will get to experience a closer look on the setting because for the moment it is not as elaborate as I would like it to be. I measure a books qualities not solely on their literary characteristics  if style, voice and narration are properly synchronised, for example  but also based on the effect it emotionally exerts on me. As quite often happens, I realise a book is not masterpiece literature, but it moves me and for me this is a very representative sign of the authors skills. What I have been trying to say is that I would always rate a book higher if it has managed to spark some feelings in me, regardless of whether it was a brilliant piece of literature or not. In Cinders case, both aspects are rated in the middle for me. The book is wellwritten, no doubt, but it wasnt exceptional. It was moving, but not heartbreaking or heartwarming. Still the enjoyment factor was higher than simply I liked it, which is why I have rated it with 3.5, but marked 4 since for me it was in the higher end of the spectre. Overall, I have higher expectations for Scarlet and I hope I will enjoy it. I will certainly read anything Marissa Meyer writes from now on.  Link to Blog 
In a nutshell: In 2045, the world is in absolute chaos and many escape to the OASIS, a video game system that allows you to do anything you would in the real world. Upon his passing, James Halliday, the creator of the system, has developed a quest to pass on his fortune, and Wade, like many others, has his eyes on the prize. I hardly EVER give books five stars, seriously. And I also never would have gone for this type of book, or would have never gone for this book in the first place had it not been one of the books of the month for a group im part of on Goodreads. I am so glad that I was inclined to buy this book and give it a chance, because I was hooked from the first chapter. To quote one of my friends, this book is amazing for anyone with any bit of nerd in them whatsoever. Allow me to explain... James Halliday, the creator of the OASIS, an intricate video game system that allows you to basically mimic real life and live in a fantasy world In OUR world, I would say its like a mix between The Sims and World of Warcraft on drugs, died 5 years ago, and still has not passed on his vast fortune. Prior to his death Halliday hid an Easter Egg in the Oasis for one person to find, and in return, to obtain his empire. Wade, like many others, has been searching for this egg, and though he may be poor on the system and in real life, he is determined to be the one to find it and enjoy living in the real world of 2045, a crumbling dystopia where RVs are piled on top of each other as compact living spaces, food is rationed, and crime is an hourly occurrence. He has many other contenders, some including friends he has made on the Oasis, bloggers, and the bloodthirsty Sixers, employees of a large corporation planning to win the contest and virtually destroy the Oasis by charging outrageous fees for services and limit free speech. This book is a thrill ride the entire way through, leaving readers on the edge of their seats and thoroughly satisfied. Three hidden keys open three secret gates Wherein the errant will be tested for worthy traits And those with the skill to survive these straits Will reach The End where the prize awaits I dont even know where to start with this book. I loved the writing style because it was the perfect mix between simplistic and complex. What I mean exactly is that the style is simple, but its written in such a descriptive manner so that you can visualize what is happening, and the book paints a picture of the fallen world and the OASIS in your head as you go along. Its not too overbearing for those who dont appreciate action video games or even video games altogether. Because the book does have many elements of a fantasy novel. It creates its own world, its own rules, and its own words like gunters those in search of the egg and haptic chair a chair that allows video gamers to have a more realistic experience within the game. The cool thing about this book is that it IS based on our world. There are many references to popular movies, television series, and music from the 80s in addition to references to video games throughout the years. So this is also intriguing because readers will read along and say Oh I remember playing this! So this book creates a world within a world AND references the world as we know it, and I think that is pretty impressive. I love the protagonist and I love the other internet friends he makes, who are also considered main characters. Although it seems sad that basically his entire life is spent on the OASIS, right down to his education, Wade is a really great character. The author writes some of the characters thoughts in a way I normally wouldnt approve of... for instance, he frequently uses the word sucks as in the world sucks or something, but Ive let that slide because Wade is an underdog that you really want to root for. Hes basically a modern day Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if you need to compare him to anyone. Hes cunning and smart and has a quick wit. Ive probably already gushed about how much I love the descriptive imagery of this book but HOLY DESCRIPTIVE IMAGERY BATMAN. I love books that can transport me to another world. And this one did it. Its amazing also because I was not anticipating that I would like this book so much. And I loved every minute of it. I am not a video game junkie by any means. Im the typical girlie gamer. I like my Pokemon and my role playing games like The SimsI cant even put an actual number on how much money I have spent on this game over the years, its expansion packs, and versions for different gaming systems and Animal Crossing. So the fact that I could enjoy this book means that its suitable for people who dont classify themselves as nerds or gamers or sci fi lovers. So dont be too quick to judge this book before you give it a chance. So why did this book get five stars? Because of all of the reasons above, and the fact that I sat back and said So, was there anything I DIDNT like about this book? and the answer was no, there was nothing I didnt like, and there were no useless suggestions Id make to the author because I always say the author should have done THIS here and its useless because obviously the book is the authors book, and the book is already published. The ending was spectacular. Predictable, but spectacular. Because the ending is pretty predictable from the beginning. But even though I know all this, the book gets a full rating from me. I want to recommend this book to people, but i know many will just ignore it because theyll consider themselves not nerdy enough or something like that. All I can say is go to the bookstore, flip through it, tell me what you think. You might be pleasantly surprised.
Its never too late to reach for happiness and no matter what life has done to you, its never too late to find it. I will start this review with the promise that reading it will not affect your enjoyment of this book in any possible way. One of the most striking qualities of this story is the sheer number of unexpected emotional reactions it evokes in the reader, page after page, scene after scene, and nothing in this review will rob you of any of those skintingling moments. But it might just give you an idea of why this was the KA book for me. Starting a new Kristen Ashley book is always an emotional experience for me, her stories forever touching my heart and making my wildest fantasises run rampant. Each new book by this author seems to set a new benchmark for all the books I read after that, but never has it happened before that a story wont let me write its review for several weeks after Ive finished reading it because every time the story crosses my mind, I am overwhelmed by book nostalgia, wishing stories like that never had to end. I have loved and lived every single Kristen Ashley book I have ever read, but this was the most epic one of them all for me, the one that completely took my breath away and the one that will always represent vintage KA style in my eyes. She wanted me for you. We meet Josephine Josie Malone at one of the most trying moments in her life  at her beloved grandmothers funeral. Josie has just lost the only family she had left, the woman who saved her from an abusive childhood by giving her a loving home, a place to belong to, a safe harbour, and by exemplifying the kind of woman Josie had always strived to become. At this moment of complete emotional loss and vulnerability, a man and his children standing near her grandmothers casket catch Josies eye, their identity unknown to her but the intense pain in their eyes acting as a beacon to her own broken heart. The following day, her grandmothers will is read and Josies world is suddenly turned inside out, its startling content leaving Josie torn between wanting to please her grandmother one last time and perplexed by the nature of her wishes. My most precious possession, the thing I treasure above anything else in this world ... I hereby bequeath to ... By all accounts, Jake Spear is a complete stranger to Josie but someone her grandmother not only seemed to hold in the highest regard, as her will shows, but also cared for deeply. A local entrepreneur and business owner, Jakes business ventures vary greatly from one another, but his every action demonstrates that he is willing to do whatever it takes to provide for the three most important people in his life  his children. A former boxing champion and threetime divorcee, Jake is the very opposite of the type of man Josie has been pining for over the last two decades, his smalltown lifestyle standing in stark contrast to the jet setting one that Josie has become accustomed to in her career, but she is strangely drawn to him. Having left home in her early twenties, determined to escape the memory of her past and reinvent herself, she has spent the last twenty years distancing herself from her emotions and looking after someone elses needs before her own. But one look at Jake and his family, coupled with her recent loss and newly acquired responsibilities, and Josie cannot help but start questioning her choices in life and finding new definitions for happiness. ...although it feels lovely you wish for me to have all kinds of beauty, Im perfectly happy without it. After suppressing her own dreams for so long, and quashing every inborn instinct she has ever had to form a family, Josie is confronted for the very first time with the very real possibility of having everything she has always wished for, if only she is brave enough to grab it by the horns and never let it go. Im fine with being alone. I want it to be that way. Honestly, I do. These characters might be slightly older and hence dealing with very different issues from the younger ones we typically encounter in KA books, but the intensity of their connection, the chemistry, and the passion between them are just as offthecharts as always. If anything, their need for each other and desire to connect on all levels feels even more urgent and eager. There are moments that will have your heart racing, there are others that will make you melt from glee, and there will be moments when you will struggle to catch your breath. Every inch of you, outside and any way you can get inside, baby, physically or emotionally, is mine. This is essentially a tale of second chances at love, or first chances at love when deprived of true happiness until later on in life, and it tells the story of two people whose lives have taught them to recognise beauty once it comes along and to allow themselves to hold onto it, regardless of how undeserving of it they believe themselves to be. Every element of a KA book is present  her inimitable prose, her intense dialogues, her unmatched character development and ability to make the reader feel such a wide spectrum of emotions  but this story went beyond that for me, the honesty with which it was told touching me on a very personal level, and making me connect with the characters like never before. Id give him anything. Id give him everything. If I had the power, Id give him the world. By the time you reach the end of this book, youll realise what a wonderful full circle the author has weaved for us, showing us that every story, even the most real and closetohome ones, can become breathtaking fairytales. KA books should really have a separate rating scale as they truly stand in a book universe of their own, but if I had to pick an absolute favourite among them all, this book would be that book for me. I promise you, this story will mark you in the best possible way and if youre anything like me, youll never fully walk away from it. Six Stars of Excellence and then some. I wanted you before I even knew you... Youre everything I ever wanted, darling. 6 STARS See this review on my blog!  Follow me on Facebook!  Follow me on Twitter!
Confusing at times, but beautiful nevertheless. This is one of those books that you need to read half way through in order to enjoy the other half.. And so I did  enjoyed and loved it. From the beginning there was something eerie about the action, the characters, all their secrets, the magic binding them all and the prophecies that threatened to tear them apart. Off course, it took time for the world building to sink in, for the characters to get to my heart, for the action to glue me to my chair with this book in my hand and to make me want to never let it go. You are cruel, dear Maggie, you made me love this book so much just before the ending came and took away some very close to my heart characters. How could you? How will I wait for the next book now? The pack of characters: 1. Blue is our notsoplain Jane  the girl who doesnt fit anywhere, too normal in her own home, but too weird in the eyes of the others. I liked her easy friendship with Gansey, her cute relationship with her mother and relatives, the blush on her cheeks when she talked with Adam and the stubbornness to help her raven boys. I still wonder about the prophecy about Blues first love, her first kiss, the boy that might die because of her... there are many things that still need to be revealed and I cant wait for that to happen. 2. Gansey is as we find out from the beginning either Blues true love, or he will be killed by her. Truth being told, I rooted for Gansey with his way of wanting to help everyone. Maybe helping with your money is not the right way, maybe using your power, your name is not the only way.. but he cared for his friends and it hurt when the others didnt see how much he just wanted to be there for them, to make things easier for them, to even buy their happiness if that was what it would take.. Also he had a borrowed life, one that he didnt ask for, but it gave him a purpose and it made him maybe a better version of himself. 3. Adam is my favorite raven boy. Am I allowed to have a favorite? I think I do and I cared so much for Adam, for his need to be his own property, for his hope that things could get better, for just wanting not to owe anything to anyone, for being so sincere and for making me smile with his shy love for a girl that might or might not be .. too young?. There were some things he said that made Blue blush just a bit and me giggle a bit more, because there is something sweet about a boy loving a girl and not knowing how to put into words what he feels. Knowing Adam was like holding a glass figurine  all smooth lines, but so damn easily breakable. He was a bit too proud to let people help him, but I was glad that his friendship with Roman made him make the right choice. 4. Ronan is the troubled one. Oh how I resented Ronan at the beginning, I am not even sure why. Half the book I didnt even like him, but them all changed and I am not even sure at what point. I have a gazillion questions about him, his family, his tattoo, his little bird.. But all I need to remember is how he showed Gansey how to through a punch and how he defended his friend, Adam when he most needed it, and how he cared for Noah.. and I could go on and on, but Ill just stop. 5. And then there was Noah.. Oh, poor boy, Noah, he told us his truth but we didnt have the ears to listen. I must confess that I kind of ignored him. He was there in the background and I never looked his way until I realized that he was standing right in my way. He was there, never really being, and that seems quite ironic at this point. The plot: Oh my! Yes, the first half was all about character and world building and it was slow. Its not like there was nothing interesting happening, but at the beginning everything was so confusing. There were tons of characters with different personalities and stories of their own and it was hard to focus on each one of them and remember all the details. There was so much mystery that I couldnt get my head around.. but then the light came and everything was so much easier to enjoy. After Blue joined the raven boys determined to solve the mystery and help Gansey, all pieces started to fit perfectly and that was the moment I realised how much I was enjoying this story. I loved the past and the present, the timeless wood and the magic surrounding Henrietta and our beloved characters. I loved the search for the lye lines and the sleeping king Glendower; and I loved all the secondary characters and their part in the play. I loved all the clues left behind and how everything fit into the story, I loved all the questions we had and how they havent been answered such that we will need to find out more. And I loved the tiny romantic side of the story  it didnt take my attention from what was important, but it was just enough to make me smile. 4.5 stars, so why not 5? I had one tiny problem with the writing style. I am not sure if I can explain it, but it got to be a bit confusing: You see, I usually love 3rd person narration, but the way it switched points of view in this particular story left some room for confusion  maybe you had no problems at all, but sometimes I didnt know if the narrator was thinking some things OR the characters were. depending on my mood you will probably see 4 or 5 stars here on GR Talking about GoodReads: Dont trust the synopsis from here. Whats that: Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she cant entirely explain? Did someone mistake this book for Twilight or what? Because this describes half the paranormal stories out there, but it also happens to be so very wrong when it cames to this story. If you ask me, the last time I checked Blue was drawn to someone else , and she could explain it quite very well.. Just saying. Anyways, this was indeed a great book, which I liked very much. It is full of magic and intrigue and it can only make you want to read the next one really, really badly. So keep an eye on it and read it if you get the chance  Happy midnight dreaming!

It can sometimes be hard for me to write a review for a Laura Kaye book just because I like to think were friends after having met a few times at signings you know how it is book nerds, haha and I never want to disappoint a friend. Lucky for me Laura always gives me a book that I thoughrly enjoy and in this case one that I LOVED. I have been waiting on Sliders book basically since the fist time I met the Raven Riders in Hard as Steel click here for my review and fell in love with Sliders sad countenance and his beautiful boys. It is hard not to have them tug at your heart every time they cross the pages of Sliders Brothers stories. If they hadnt tugged at your heart before now who are you even, heart of steel! they most definitely will in Ride Wild. Ride Wild is the story of Slider and Cora. Slider has spent years separating himself from his brotherhood at Raven Riders. The death of his wife sending him in to a depression, one he doesnt even fully realize he is in hes spent years walking through each day but not truly living. Then a spunky, beautiful, but broken woman comes into his and his sons world. Cora is life, she is full of spirit and love. She is joy and peace, but underneath it all she is broken and she is scared. Her past haunts her though she would never let anyone see that, not when she has so many people that she needs to be strong for. Cora and Haven found themselves being rescued by the Raven Riders months back after running away to save Haven and little known to anyone else, Cora from a terrible situation. In those months Haven has found herself and fallen in love but Cora, Cora is still just hanging around. Shes living at the Raven Riders compound and she occasionally baby sits for Slider when he has to work, but Cora has dreams and they are starting to poke at her heart telling her it may be time to move on. Time to find her own path and future, but during her time with the Raven Riders and the time shes been helping out Slider shes started to fall in love with his little men and the thought of leaving them and Slider behind is an ache in her heart. Luckily Slider has two perceptive, loving, and slick boys who convince him that what they need in their life is a full time nanny, what they need is Cora. I loved the pace of Ride Wild, this isnt a fast paced instalove. This is a love that develops over time and through the interactions of the couple with each other and with Sliders boys. This is the way you think of love happening to real people. Its thoughtful and sedate while being passionate and consuming. There is a maturity to Slider and Coras relationship that I truly appreciated, it makes for a nice change of pace in the romance genre which is often fast paced loves, with all sorts of drama and often times carelessness until the couple suddenly grows up. That isnt what we get here and I loved this book even more for it. I loved that Cora is and always will be her own heroine. She doesnt need Slider to make her dreams reality, she will make them happen on her own, but having his support is integral to her happiness. One thing I loved about Slider is his ability to understand that she doesnt need him, that she wants him, just as he is I love that he can give her what she needs and simply be there to support her. This line right here made my heart melt into a puddle of goo because isnt this the kind of relationship every person wants? Look at this face. Look into these eyes. And never, ever doubt that youre looking at your biggest fan, your staunchest defender, and the man who will always hold you up and have your back. He will give her everything he can but he wont do anything for her that she doesnt want him to but he will always be there standing at her back...how does one not swoon after that? Seriously if all that doesnt get you right in the heart what else would...oh how about rescued dogs, and rescued fighting dogs? Oh my gosh, this is something very close to my heart as I have a rescued fighting dog who is one of my loves but will never be the dog she could have been because of where she came from. It was so hard to imagine myself in Coras shoes as she took on a volunteer role at an animal rescue. My heart broke with hers and the tears fell with out abandon the first day she assists with one of the abandoned fighting dogs. Its so hard to believe that there are people in this world who abuse animals in this way, but I have a big girl at home that is proof of it and I know exactly how Cora felt that day and the many days after as she finds herself embroiled in the nastiness of the dog fighting world. I adored that Laura gives her readers an opportunity to see, even if it is just on the surface, what dog fighting is like. What it does to the dogs that survive it and to the people that help bring them back from such a horrible life. There is plenty of romance, suspense, and swoon worthiness in Ride Wild, you will not be disappointed. I loved the way that Laura wraps it all up and giving us a glimpse into the future. I loved that we get a bit of a look at the Raven Riders being a bit more ruthless than what we are used to seeing. They will never be that hard core or what I would consider a 1 club but that isnt who they are. They are a club of men who will do what it takes to get things done yes, but will try and do it through legal channels first. Their role in the world is not to fight against the world and authority but to protect those that need it, to be taken seriously in that role they have to try and work with in the system but there should never be a doubt that if they have to step outside the bounds of propriety they will do it and I appreciated the reminder of that in this book. I of course always suggest reading the series in order, you will be a tad lost on one storyline if you dont but you can read this as a standalone so if this is your first time picking up a Raven Riders book dont hesitate to start but get ready to head back to your book seller for the rest of them because you will be buying them before you are even done with Ride Wild, haha.  HAPPY READING  
Im not sure where to begin talking about this book. I have been nervous about reading it for months now, ever since I first peeked at it, and worried for my heart. But then I heard so many good things about this book. How many people loved it. And I knew I had to try to read it as well. And I got to be a part of the blog tour, and was sent this gorgeous print ARC copy, so now I couldnt put it off anymore. So I finally picked up Red Queen. And Im so glad I did so. I had some issues, but mostly I really liked it. My feelings for this book are complicated. But I will try my best to explain them all. First I want to talk about all the things I liked about this book. I found the writing to be really good and exciting, it didnt bother me at all. Which is very important for me. I found that I really liked reading from the point of view of Mare, whom I pretty much adored in the beginning of this book. I thought that all the different characters were pretty interesting to read about and I wanted to know more about them all at all times. Then there is the plot. The story in Red Queen is so exciting. It is different and it was so good. I loved reading about the Silvers and the Reds. How the Silvers have silver blood, how they all have special powers. And how different they all were. And how frightening and exciting it was to read about all at the same time. I wanted to know more. I wanted to read more about those with abilities. Which means I really enjoyed reading those scenes, as I found it to be very interesting and exciting and well done. I really liked the plot in this book. I liked reading about Mare and how she came to be betrothed to a prince. How she came to hide her red blood. I especially enjoyed getting to know Cal, whom I adored to pieces. I feared there was a love triangle in this book. Or even more boys. And in a way there is, but not the usual kind. Which means I loved it, because there isnt much romance in this book. But there are a few silly boys, like Kilorn, whom I didnt see the point of. Hmph. But yeah. I did like the romance a lot. There are so many characters in this book. I wouldnt be able to begin to mention them all. But I do want to talk about some of them. I really loved Cal. He was awesome. Then there was his brother, Maven. Hmph. I found him to be obvious from the beginning, but yeah. I just didnt like him much at all. And his mother, the Queen. Shudders. She was pretty awful to read about. Sigh. But I liked Julian. Probably. And I very much liked reading about Mares family in the beginning of this book. They were pretty awesome. When I had read about half the book, I was sure this would be a four star read for me, which had me very excited. But then things changed. And I got angry at things. And it made my heart hurt. And because of this my rating of this book is a three star. But keep in mind that the first half of the book was four stars for me, and I really did like this book. And Im so so excited about the sequel. Yet a bit nervous too, as I worry what will happen. But mostly excited. Because I am dying to know what happens. But yeah. I should talk a bit about those things I had some issues with. Mare started changing in the last half of the book. She started thinking differently, and it bothered me. It bothered me that she thought she was the most important thing about the rebellion. That she felt like she was leading and being responsible for deaths. She wasnt. Not at all. So that bothered me, her thinking she was much more important than she really was. And that whole trying to save Kilorn thing. But, why? Why did she care? And then, Cal. She had feelings for him. I know there isnt much romance in this book, which I kind of liked, but there were also some really sweet scenes between Mare and Cal. And I wanted them together so badly. But he is also a Prince. And he has a job to do. And Mare started hating him for one thing. And I didnt understand it at all. She claims he betrayed her. But how? I dont get it. She acted so stupid in the last half of the book. Hmph. But I still liked reading about her. Some things just bothered me. I just had some issues with things happening in the last half of the book. How Mare acted. How she believed every single thing someone told her. But at the same time, I was interested in this book. Because it was exciting and I wanted to know what would happen next. I really liked reading about the characters and the plot and how everything happened in this world. I loved reading about the different abilities, and what Mare could do, how she trained. It was all pretty exciting. And I enjoyed most of it. But yes. This must be a three star for me. Because it feels like a lie, if I give it four stars. Because I did have issues with the last half. And Mare made me so angry right then. Hmph. But at the same time I really did like this book. And it was a four star at times, especially in the beginning. Either way, I really think a lot of people will love this book. So you should all go buy it. 3 I read Red Queen from January 27th to 28th. And it was worth it. Red Queen was all kinds of exciting and horrible and awesome. 3  My review will be posted on February 9th. Preview review here: 
A wild ride through the ice roads of Alaska. The plot is farfetched, but it is a fun adventure. The stars of this book are the brutal setting and a bright tenyearold girl named Ruby, who is totally deaf. After several months of separation, wildlife photographer Matt is supposed to be traveling from a remote Inupiaq village to Fairbanks, Alaska to reunite with his wife Yasmin and his daughter Ruby. Yasmin and Ruby are anxious to see him, but he never arrives. The authorities inform Yasmin that he is presumed dead in a catastrophic fire that destroyed the village he was staying in; there were no survivors. Yasmin refuses to believe that he is dead, despite the evidence she is presented with. When the police refuse to search for him, she decides that she is going to find him by any means necessary. Yasmin and Ruby head out on a dangerous road trip through the Arctic Circle to Anaktue, hoping to find Matt before he can succumb to the brutal conditions. Not only do they have the cruel, unforgiving terrain and weather to contend with, but there is a sinister pair of headlights following in the distance. Is it just another ice road trucker or is it someone who wants to stop Yasmin from finding Matt? A memory played out in front of her, vivid in the darkness. ... Shed had this sense before that time was not linear, but bending back on itself. with current emotions finding a sense of themselves in the past. The Quality of Silence is like a 90s action movie, especially the conclusion. It is completely farfetched from beginning to end; this is is a story about a woman who who travels through the dangerous Arctic Circle in the depths of winter, with no experience and her tenyearold daughter as a passenger! Once I stopped overthinking it, I enjoyed the ride. The story alternates between Yasmins and Rubys perspectives, with the occasional interlude from some of the supporting characters. The perspective changes are abrupt and only separated by a paragraph break. It was confusing at first, but the voices are distinct enough that it is easy to adjust. Most of the book is set in Alaska, but there are some flashbacks to the early days of Yasmin and Matts relationship. In the Arctic tundra, it was impossible to feel important but simple to feel connected to something uncircumscribed by time and distance. The setting was my favorite part! Lupton did an amazing job creating a chilly atmosphere and a hostile environment rife with danger. The cold is described as predatory and remorseless and the land as not just passively hostile but actively aggressive. A large portion of the book is inside of an 18wheelers cabin, and I felt like I was sitting in there with them. My stomach lurched as they sped through the frozen mountainous terrain! She felt knifed by love, winded by the sharpness of it. The sensation was oddly familiar, a harsher version of the pain shed felt in their early days, long before marriage and a child, before there was any tangible security that hed still be with her tomorrow. And time was no longer stretched out and linear but bent back on itself and broken into fragments so that the young man shed loved so passionately was as vividly recalled and equally present as the husband shed argued with eight days ago. Yasmin I never really warmed to Yasmin. She is moviestar gorgeous and an astrophysicist, with exceptional luck and skill. Yasmins professional background is used to explain her relative success at trucking despite inexperience. Despite her supposed brilliance, the decisions she makes are baffling, even accounting for the shock of discovering that her husband is most likely dead. I was mortified that she was in a situation where leaving her tenyearold daughter with random truckers seemed like a good idea! In the beginning of the book, Yasmin was concerned that Matt was having an affair with an Inupiaq woman and Im still not sure why visually confirming that there was wildlife in Alaska made her immediately certain that Matt was trustworthy. She has to learn to survive in the real world, Yasmin had said. ...The real world thing, its bollocks. The world is a million different places and Ruby will find the place she wants to be. Matt Yasmin is also constantly on Rubys case about using her speaking voice. I felt so uncomfortable every time she asked Ruby to use her words. As frustrating as her requests are, Yasmins motivations became understandable and her concerns came from a good place. Yasmin does experience quite a bit of character growth throughout the book. The time alone in the cab gives Yasmin a chance to bond with Ruby and finally listen to her voice. Whether they find Matt or not, the arduous journey becomes a pivotal point in the motherdaughter relationship. Being deaf isnt something I can change. Mum doesnt understand this but I dont know if I even want to. Its my Rubyworld, a quiet world that I look at and touch and sometimes taste but dont hear. Dad says quietness is beautiful. So maybe my world is lovelier than other peoples. And maybe making sounds I cant hear in my quiet world would spoil everything. I didnt care whether they found Matt alive, dead, or at all, but I did care that Ruby made it out of this trip safely. She was such an awesome kid! She was so resourceful and I loved how she utilized technology, especially her eavesdropping method. She was also very articulate. She expressed the reasons why she was uncomfortable using her speaking voice with such clarity and confidence. Yasmin is constantly pressuring Ruby to integrate with the hearing world, but Ruby manages the real world on her own terms. Another favorite character was Adeeb Azizi, a trucker Yasmin and Ruby meet during their journey. Adeeb and Ruby are both treated like outsiders and they form a quick bond. Yasmin gained a different perspective from watching them interact. I wish he had played a bigger role in the story and I hope the check Yasmin handed him was enough to cover the damage to his truck! What we know is filtered by our flaws, and sometimes turned more beautiful by them. The thing that drove me crazy was the slang in Rubys sections, especially the phrase supercoolio. The frequency with which it was interspersed in the text felt unnatural and the term seemed outdated. Maybe kids do still use that word, but I did find coolio on a recent list of 18 Slang Words That Will Make You Sound Like an Old Fart. Awesome sauce was the second most annoying term used. Even though I cant hear the screechy sound, I get the general uggghness. But the satellite is OMG in a coolio, not screechy way... To be fair, Ruby doesnt always express her thoughts like this but it is a distinct part of her voice. I enjoyed the conclusion and I loved Rubys journey over the course of the novel. In Quality of Silence, the characters discover the power of words and how a voice can come in many different forms. Rubys parents professions that deal with the natural world play a part in showing the smallness of humans in relation to the universe and the tricks that time plays on us. This book fostered a greater interest in Deaf culture, Alaska, Inupiaq culture, fracking and ice road trucking. I spent a long time on YouTube watching various ice road trucking shows. TERRIFYING! Recommended to anyone looking for some fun escapism and who wants to do a little bit of traveling to the Arctic Circle from the comfort of home. I received this book from the LibraryThings Early Reviewers program, in exchange for an honest review.
4.6 stars. How do I even begin to say goodbye to these characters? Warning : I dont know why but when I read my reviews and other peoples reviews on my phone the spoilers Ithey have hidden are not hidden! Just be careful and read this on a computer if you can! I dont want you to be spoiled!! Let me know if you cancant see this spoilers on your phone and if this is happening to anyone else. Let me start with the cons: 1. Not enough Noah. He gets possessed by the demon, attacks Blue, and then is in a few other scenes. I wanted Blue and Noah to talk about it. I wanted her to say that it wasnt his fault and that she wasnt mad at him and she didnt do it. I know she thought it at him but thats not the same as saying it. There wasnt enough of Noah, Gansey, Ronan, Adam, and Blue all together. 2. Im indifferent about Henry Cheng. I honestly feel like the other characters that we are know and love couldve filled his role and what he brought to the book quite easily. Although, without Henry we dont have the Toga party scene so Im glad he was there for some reasons. 3. As other people have said, there are some questions that have been left unanswered. None that make myself rage personally, but I can understand why people are leaving this book feeling incomplete. Can Blue and Gansey kiss now? Im going to say yes, because Gansey is kind of a new person now. What happened with Piper, The Gray Man, and all the other bad guys? Are Ronan and Adam dating? I feel like we have more of an answer on this as Adam was driving Ronans car at the end showing that there lives will now be woven together but still a specific yes or no answer wouldve been nice. Blue is half tree? DID NOAH SACRIFICE HIMSELF AT THE END?? Why didnt we get a reaction to that? Im also sad we didnt get to see the women of 300 Fox Way again at the end of the book! Im sure there are more questions but I cant think of them right now. As for the pros: 1. The characters. As Ive stated many times and cant say enough, these characters are the reason this book series will go down as one of my all time favorites. They feel like real people. I wish they were real. I want to hug them all and keep them safe. I havent felt this connect to the entire cast of characters in a very long time. Maybe since Harry Potter. I loved every character and for different reasons. Gansey is still my favorite throughout the whole series. The way he loves his friends, would do anything for his friends and the people he cares about, is very admirable. 2. All my beautiful ships. Im so happy with what happened to Ronan and Adam. The fact that Maggie didnt make us suffer waiting until the end of the book where they finally kiss was fantastic. And the fact that Ronan kissed Adam first! I loved it! Im also so incredibly happy with what happened and how Blue and Ganseys relationship was handled. THE TOGA PARTY. Gansey getting Adams permission to date Blue. Gansey checking on Blue, Gansey letting Blue wear his coat, Blue and Gansey just being together throughout the book again not making us wait that long to see them as a couple, thanks Maggie!. I absolutely loved it. 3. The character development. Seeing the progress from the first book to the last book with all the characters was a lovely arc to see. Ronan wearing a suit of anger, violence, and sadness and not being out in the first book. Adam scared to death of his father, scared to be vulnerable finds love in Ronan in the last book. Blue possibly being embarrassed of her family and her not being the only physic, refusing to ever fall in love in fear of that person dying. Now Blue holds Ganseys hand proudly and loves him. Gansey, my sweet Gansey, he was always looking for the king but never really wanting to find it because he didnt want it to be over. He was scared of what he might see and what might happen if it was over. Now, Gansey seeing Glendower dead and coming to terms with the fact that it is over . Before I put this series in order from my favorite to least favorite, I need to stress how close they are to my heart. How much I love all of the books. How they are all my favorites and how at any day, I could have this book first and the the next day I could have that book last and this book first. But as it stands right now my order is : 1. The Dream Theives 2. The Raven King 3. Blue Lily, Lily Blue 4. The Raven Boys In the end, this series is one I will take with me and it will hold a special place in my heart forever. I already cannot wait to reread it. If you still have not read The Raven Cycle, do yourself a favor and pick it up. I highly recommend. Before Reading: THE COVER IS SO BEAUTIFUL!!
review originally posted here Elizabeth Weins Telemakos series is one I was planning to read eventually, given that it has been compared to Megan Whalen Turners Queens Thief series Chachic calls it Gen in Africa. The Sunbird has been waiting on my TBR pile for a few months now. When a publicist from Egmont contacted me about Code Name Verity, I wasnt sure about a story that is a WWII drama about two girls, one caught by the Gestapo. I was worried because Ive read some books lately that wrung me out. Well, I was an emotional wreck after this one, but I still recommend it highly. The Premise: During World War II, a girl has been captured by the Gestapo in Nazi occupied France. Her papers say shes Maddie, but she maintains that that is not her name. This young mystery woman is given pen and paper and a deal. For her clothes, she will confess wireless codes, and then the Location of British Airfields for Invasion of Europe. She begins to write, and as she writes, she tells the story of who she is and how she came to be in her cell, and of her best friend Maddie, the pilot who brought her to France before crashing and perhaps dying with her plane. My Thoughts: This is a story where the less I say the better, so this is going to be a very short review by my standards, and a review with very little detail about what is going on in the story. What I can tell say is what I said in the premise  a captured young woman has to write out some information for the Nazis and her confession is what were reading. Of course, as a reader, Im very concerned about this girl. She explains that shes a coward and thats why shes going to tell the Nazis everything, if only to buy a few more days of relative comfort before her death. While she says shes not Maddie, she sure knows how to tell Maddies story and how Maddie became a pilot. She gives so much detail that I wonder if she is in fact Maddie. This is a YA book, so the depictions of violence are somewhat tame, but we know that there are other prisoners tortured nearby and her captors have threatened to use kerosene and light her on fire amongst other things. Under those conditions, would she tell the truth? Is she giving away only unimportant information? Or is everything shes saying a blatant lie? Code Name Verity answers those questions eventually, but along the way it paints a grim picture of a desperate young woman surrounded by unfriendly faces. She escapes through her retelling of a happier past. There are a lot of details here about Maddie, a young girl finding ways to gain flight experience, and how Maddies circumstance leads her to the elegant enigma writing the story. This is a story about their bravery, and the strong friendship that develops between them. People, bring tissues. By the end of this book you will cry. I almost made it without a tear, but I couldnt get past the last page without falling to pieces. The only reason I didnt cry before that was because I was reading in public there is a wrecking ball of a scene before the end and I had a verklempt moment. Later, as I was recounting the story, I couldnt do it without a catch in my voice. Despite the tears, I didnt feel depressed by Code Name Verity. I was just so moved. This is a book about war, but it focuses on individuals  two girls fighting for their country and all that happens because of it. Their personal accounts make the emotional impact of Code Name Verity huge. Sigh, that human spirit. I had my little quibbles with the story, but by the end, that emotional punch knocked me off my feet. I cant recommend this enough. The sun still sets quite late in the north of England in August, and Maddie on fabric wings flew low over the long sands of Holy Island and saw seals gathered there, and the great castle crags of Lindisfarne and Bamburgh to the north and south, and the ruins of the twelfth century priory where the glowing gospels were painted, and all the fields stretching yellow and green toward the low Cheviot Hills of Scotland. Maddie flew back following the 70mile 2000yearold dragons back of Hadrians Wall, to Carlisle and then south through the Lakeland fells, along Lake Windermere. The soaring mountains rose around her and the poets waters glittered beneath her in the valleys of memory  hosts of golden daffodils, Swallows and Amazons, Peter Rabbit. She came home by way of Blackstone Edge above the old Roman road to avoid the smoke haze over Manchester, and landed back at Oakway sobbing with anguish and love; love, for her island home that shed seen whole and fragile from the air in the space of an afternoon, from coast to coast, holding its breath in a glass lens of summer and sunlight. All about to be swallowed in nights of flame and blackout. Maddie landed at Oakway before sunset and shut down the engine, then sat in the cockpit weeping. More than anything else, I think, Maddie went to war on behalf of the Holy Island seals. Overall: Blown away. I knew that this was set in the war and that the story begins with a girl writing out information for the Nazis, but as I read what she has to say, I got caught up in her past and her personality. When we got back to the present timeline, the emotional impact snuck up on me and laid me to waste. I was a jumble of conflicting feelings at the end of the book, but the last lingering one was good and cathartic. I feel so proud of these characters somehow.
Video review spoiler free   Trigger warnings for this book if you need them: Violence in the romantic relationship goes unchallenged Infertile women referred to as broken and damaged this idea is challenged, but still giving you a heads up since its a sensitive topic I was sent an early copy of this book by the author for review. All opinions are my own. My real rating of this book is 3.5 stars. I loved a lot about it, but had to lower my rating because the one thing I disliked was that it portrays violence in the romance we are supposed to support without ever showing it as wrong, and strengthening the relationship afterward. Ill talk more about this in detail in a minute, but first let me tell you what this book does well. Retelling This is probably my favorite retelling of The Little Mermaid that I have ever read, as far as the story goes. Its told from a different angle and the world is inspired by Norse mythology, both of which allow the story to have room for surprises. Even though its very different, you can see how major plot points line up with the original tale. Its one of the better done retellings Ive ever read because its both loyal to the original but still feels new. I also adored the mermaid setting. So many TLM retellings turn the story into a contemporary and that usually loses me. I love mermaids and loved seeing this underwater world. Plot The story was fast paced. Its a short book but a lot happens. It took me a few chapters to adjust to the underwater world mermaids swim instead of walk places, which my brain was not used to but once I did, I was hooked. It was very engaging and exciting. The setting has a dystopian theme based around the mermaids being valued for their fertility. As I mentioned above, I think some triggering language is used in showing this society, but I did enjoy that the story was challenging this sexist culture. Diversity This is ownvoices bi representation. I cant personally speak to whether its good representation or not, but other early reviews seem to be saying its great. Theres also fat rep, though as a fat girl, one line bothered me and I keep forgetting this rep was present because it was rarely mentioned. Theres also a side character who uses theythem pronouns Violent Relationship Back to this. As I havent seen any other reviews point this out yet, this will be a bit long. Since I had an early copy of the book, this quote is subject to change, but here is the main scene I took issue with. Ersel and Ragna punch each other in the face: No! My hands curled into fists, and suddenly I wanted to punch her. Im going back to the fortress. Im going to fix things. For everyone, not just myself. She snorted dismissively. Good, then maybe youre not such a coward after all. I thought that maybe you were, because of how easily you let that merman drag you away. That wasnt fair, not after the things Id done for her on the ice shelf. My knuckles collided with her cheek. She stepped back, pressing her hand to the place where Id struck. Behind us, several members of the crew gasped. I started to apologize, but suddenly my head snapped back, so violently it seemed my neck would break. Cursing, Ragna shook out her fingers. My jaw burned, and pain radiated up through my teeth page 191192 Further down the same page, this is the only discussion of the violence we get. We glare at each other; hostility crackled in the air. Finally, Ragna let out a slow breath. Theres something a little monstrous in both of us. And maybe it has to be that way for us to survive. ... Gods, Ragna swore, but all the venom in her voice had vanished. She wiped a trail of blood from my lip. Blushing, she looked at the deck. Your teeth are red. I shouldnt have hit you. I hit you first. I cranked my jaw to loosen it. I wont do that again. I have enough enemies. Im still exiled from the ice mountain. Plus, you punch better than me. page 192 Ragnas only sorry she drew blood. Ersels more concerned that she doesnt punch as well as Ragna. No one acknowledges it as having been wrong, and the violence is excused away as a character flaw. This was not enough of a discussion about physical abuse for me because in real life habitual abusers promise to never do it again, and yet they are repeat offenders. A few pages later, Ersel intentionally causes pain for Ragna again, though it wasnt through punching. Physical abuse in the main ship is brushed aside quickly and the relationship deepens afterward, which you could argue romanticizes it. This is a harmful portrayal of romance, especially in a book marketed toward a young adult audience. I was sensitive to this because I have experienced an abusive relationship in my past I really hate that I have to keep mentioning this and reliving it due to YOUNG ADULT books. If you dont think this was an abusive act, I ask you to picture either of the characters as male. Would you be upset then? There are so many other ways to show that characters are hot headed or show them having conflict without making them punch their romantic partner in the face. These lines could have been cut out and the scene, plot, and characters wouldnt have changed in any way. So why perpetuate an unhealthy ideal? Im so irritated by this because I was REALLY shipping these characters together at first! And there are so few ownvoices bi romances out there and many people are anticipating this book and some will pick it up already shipping this couple. There is definitely room for books to discuss abuse in relationships, but it deserves a much more nuanced examination than was included in The Seafarers Kiss. Would I recommend it? I would highly recommend this as a Little Mermaid retelling. If you like The Little Mermaid, Norse mythology, or are looking for an ownvoices bi main character, then you will probably like this. Sadly, I cannot recommend this as a romance, which is its main genre. It portrays an unhealthy relationship. If you are looking for a YA fantasy with a fairy tale feel that has an ownvoices ff romance that does not involve abuse, I would recommend Of Fire and Stars. Tropes used include the love triangle which I felt was only built up on one side, and the notlikeothergirls trope which was challenged. Even if you hate these tropes, I do not think youd hate their use in this book. Very mixed thoughts on this book. It had good and bad things, but unfortunately the bad thing was quite damaging and really lowered my rating.
It was about 44.5 almost the entire time, but then it made me cry so I decided to round all the way up. Hazel Grace Lancaster is a sixteenyearold who spends her time reading, watching admittedly bad TV with her parents, taking college classes, and dying fromliving with cancer. When she meets hunky, intriguing Augustus Waters at a local support group, shes pretty sure she has found a kindred spirit who not only matches her sense of humor and history with illness, but also counters her reluctance to live a full life and her desire to hunker down in solitude and misery. Shes especially thrilled when he reads and falls in love with her favorite book, but two kids with a history of cancer are an ominous beginning for a Great Teenage Love Story. I dont read a lot of YA, but when I do its usually for a good reason. I read this at The Wifes express recommendation, and Im really glad I did. This is a beautiful sad love story that feels authentic. It seems to defy some of the YA conventions which generally discourage me from reading the genre, and I really enjoyed getting lost in its little infinity for a few days. It just seemed to have an unexpected amount of substance. Hazel and Augustus are a wonderful pair of young lovers, and their relationship feels so genuinely teenage and believable that I never wanted their story to end. They talked and acted like teenagers admittedly very loquacious and wise teenagers, but still, a little sarcastic and snappy at times, but they also loved their parents a full set each! and were presented in a way that made it very hard to dislike them. I feel like the author was somehow able to get into and present the mind of a teenage girl in a way that felt genuine but also didnt make me want to claw my face off coughBellaSwancough. Hazels mind was an interesting place to be: witty, natural, sardonic, but still sweet. Augustus seemed at times too good to be true, but as his character was gradually developed, he seemed like the greatest guy ever and the best part of all: he was attractive and amazing, but Hazel didnt feel the need to tell us that EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. His character was deep enough that the attractiveness came across naturally, she didnt have to keep reminding us or describing his body or hair or eyes. He was hot, but he was much more than that. Even the side characters, even the ones who appeared for only a scene or two, felt believable and interesting, and everyone seemed to have real human quirks. The way they talked sometimes teetered on the line of being kind of annoying modern teen lingo, but it never really crossed it for me. The story was interesting and surprising and of course heartbreaking at times, but it never crossed over to maudlin, which a cancer story can VERY easily do. The way the author handled the reality of living with something you know will eventually kill you was insightful and kind of remarkable, and the ending was sad, but not depressing. It was tragic, but it was also much more than that. I generally had no idea what was going to happen, and each step of the journey was a splendid surprise and some not so splendid... Peter Von Houten, I just never know what youre going to say or do!. Even when things I generally expected happened, I still was somehow surprised. I laughed out loud, I teared up multiple times each, I tore through some pages and I lingered through others, and when it was over I couldnt stop thinking about it. There were some content issues, though apparently pretty minor compared to other YA books, and I thought there was a little bit of a slant against God and religion in general, but I was able to overlook this in the end because, 1 I feel like a teenager with a terminal illness and not much of a foundation regarding the beyond might feel like this sometimes, which is in some ways understandable, 2 it didnt seem malicious, just kind of defeatist and fatalist, and 3 I feel like it was redeemed a little, especially in Augustuss more open worldview, even if Hazel hasnt quite figured it out yet. I admit I agonized a little over my rating of this one, but in the end it totally engrossed me and I wished it didnt have to end so soon, and its not just any book that can make me feel that way. Oh, and as an aside, I did want to mention that the Walt Disney World pedant in me kind of took umbrage at inaccurateoutdated terminology relative to said theme park, but I let it slide in the end. :  This is a splendid book. Ive never had cancer, but I DO remember what it was like to be a teenager in love, and this book is a beautiful and honest and funny and sad presentation of that. Yes, I readily admit when a book makes me cry, and this one did, but it also made me laugh, and I cant seem to get over Hazel Grace and Augustus. I feel like this review hasnt managed to adequately describe how this book made me feel, but I dont know if any review I may write ever could. It was just nice and sad and funny and lovely and snarky and human and good. I wouldnt be at all against reading more John Green one day. P.S. Reading through some of the reviews here, I thought of something to add: Dur, of course its emotionally manipulative though thats not the term I would use, thats kind of the point of cinema and literature. Pride and Prejudice and Star Wars and any Thomas Hardy selection manipulate emotions as much as anything. Thats why we read  to feel things. That is all.  Notable quotes: Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction, which you cant tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal 33. ... the line was quiet but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone 72. You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are Augustus, 123. As Augustus read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once 125. I actually miread this one when I marked it, but I still like it, ha ha. Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin Dutch cabbie, 157. But yes. I believe in Something with a capital S. Always have Augustus, 168. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice... 209. ... and then he broke down, just for one moment, his sob roaring impotent like a clap of thunder unaccompanied by lightning, the terrible ferocity that amateurs in the field of suffering might mistake for weakness 215.
Though Ive heard some great things about Shaun David Hutchinsons novels, none of them really spoke to me. The descriptions sounded like they might be a bit too heavy and dudely. Nothing about them screamed or even whispered Christina book. We Are the Ants, though, sounded up my alley. I mean, hello, mm romance with bonus aliens? SIGN. ME. UP. Also, the cover is really pretty which is ninety percent why I wanted it totally did not impact my decision in anyway. We Are the Ants was my first Hutchinson novel, but it wont be my last, because of his sensitive, honest treatment of mental illness and family. You know how I said Hutchinsons books seemed like they might be too heavy? Well, in some ways, I was right on the money, because this book is heavy. However, its not TOO heavy. Hutchinson includes enough black humor and some genuinely happy scenes, enough that I was able to take the dark parts and actually to feel them much more. Im very particular about how I want issue books, and Hutchinson hit it right on the mark. That said, it was sometimes tough to read because oh my god poor Henry. Henry Denton is falling apart big time. Hes been abducted by the Sluggers, some sort of alien life form, since he was thirteen, and they want him to determine if the world will end on January 29th. And, just to be dicks, they return him in inconvenient places, often without clothing. After his first abduction, his dad abandoned the family, and Henrys sure that its his fault. His brother, Charlie, bullies him at home. His mom struggles to pay their bills solo on her waitressing salary. His beloved boyfriend Jesse killed himself, and, again, Henrys sure its his faultfor not loving him enough or for loving him too much or for just not being enough. After Jesses suicide, Henry kept his distance from Audrey, the third in their trio. The only comfort in Henrys life? Sex with one of his bullies, Marcus. Marcus spends the whole book deciding whether he wants to let the world end; all he would have to do to stop it is press a button, but hes not sure he wants to. He keeps asking everyone he knows if they would save the world, and almost all say that they would, but Henrys not so sure. Here, I think Hutchinson really gets the teen mind, because, as much as Henry looks around and goes yeah, I dont think we deserve to live, its clearly all about Henry not wanting to have to deal with the future. Schools easier if you dont need to care about your grades because the worlds going to end. He doesnt need to worry about his moms troubles, his grandmas dementia, or the fact that his asshole brother has knocked up his girlfriend. Henry doesnt know how to handle his life and not pushing the button means he doesnt have to. My teen life wasnt as messed up as Henrys, and I still would have hesitated, Im pretty certain, because everything can feel so insurmountable. Henrys relationship with Marcus in We Are the Ants is great, in a really terrible way. I mean, its completely unhealthy, but its realistic and raw. Henry couldnt cope with Jesses death, and Marcus was someone he wouldnt fall in love with but could get that physical pleasure from. It all sort of backfires when he ends up having some feelings for Marcus, who can be a nice guy when he stops worrying about what other people are thinking. I also really liked that gay sex is mentioned, because often the sex part of mm teen isnt touched at all. The way that it ends, with Marcus not learning anything, but ending up paying for his crimes, is sad but believable. His arc sort of parallels Henrys brothers in a really cool way. Charlie was clearly a Marcus in his high school days, but, for love of his girlfriend and unborn daughter, he cleans up and becomes nicer. Marcus, however, in love with someone he refuses to acknowledge, falls apart and becomes the worst version of himself. The family dynamics are strong and atypical. Henrys mom is not at all a stereotypical mother. She loves her kids, and shes involved, but she also has a tendency to put her head in the sand about some things because she doesnt know how to deal with them. Hmmm, I wonder where Henry got that. She also smokes like a chimney and isnt loving in any sort of June Cleaver kind of way. His moms kind of brash, but thats how some people are. Shes not an amazing mom, but she tries to do her best by her kids. I also love the portrayal of the grandmother, as her memory disintegrates, the high moments and the lows, and the tough decision about whether to put her in a home. The burgeoning romance between Henry and Diego is sweet but also kind of fucked up. Its vaguely a spoiler that Diegos into dudes despite an exgirlfriend, but come on we all saw that coming and, yes, I love that. I do sort of ship it, in the sense that Henry clearly needs something better than Marcus, and their feelings for each other are real, but theyre also both too broken to really work at this point. I like, though, that they are at least aware of that. Its not an HEA kind of book, so that works. The thing that worked least for me actually ended up being the sci fi element. Youll see that Ive tagged this as both contemporary and science fiction. Its definitely more of a contemporary, sort of in the style of Noggin by John Corey Whaley, where the science fiction is central to the concept but not what the book is actually about at all. In this case, though, I wish Hutchinson had dived into the science fiction a bit more. He sort of straddles the line between the aliens being real and being a creation of Henrys mind as a way of processing his grief. That would be completely fine if I could believe that the latter were the case, but Henry was first abducted before his first mental trigger his dad leaving the family and theres a lot thats hard to explain away if he wasnt actually being abducted. Thus, I find the abandoning of the sci fi plot line at the end deeply frustrating. I mean, it all ends up being written in his school assignment, but I hate the idea that it was all fictional even more, especially since the bully, a main theme of the book, happens because hes space boy. Its all too deeply intertwined to not get resolved. Someday when youre in the mood for something that will punch you in the feels, give We Are the Ants a go. Its complex, dark, and heartrending, but also hopeful.
Revealing Eden seems to be one of the controversial books this year, if judging by the intense reactions of Goodreads reviewers and book bloggers. My own curiosity with this novel has to do with my interest in racial relations and communication due to both my own personal experiences growing up in a racially diverse community and as a professional social worker. While I am not as knowledgeable on YA novels and romances, both being the core genre of this book, I am quite familiar with science fiction and the postapocalypse field, but also like novels that have social messages and comingofage concerns. The way I approached this review is important. Once I decided to read it I avoided all other reviews. After I finished it and formulate my opinion, I looked at the other reviews and, most significantly, Ms. Foyts responses. Normally I would not do this but the authors own odd defense of her book helps explain some of the reactions reviewers have given and helps us understand where this novel idea came from. I mention this because there has been more than a few complaints that a reviewer should review the book, not the author. I agree with that...unless the author brings herself into her book by her own writings about it which is what Ms. Foyt has done. Also, examining an authors motives as related to his or her work has always been a part of literary criticism for a lot longer than Ive been around. I am not going to write a synopsis of the plot as the Goodreads description and the other reviews do that very well. So I will go right to the two main questions that come up with this book. 1. Is it any good? Number one question for any review and 2 Is it racist? 1 Is it any good? I found the writing adequate if unremarkable, yet as the book continued it was strange how unfocused it became. It starts out as science fiction, yet the scifi elements are so badly addressed it becomes forgotten. If any writer is going to use issues like global warming and future technology they really should do the research. Most of the scientific explanations in this book are laughable. Another serious flaw is the main character of Eden. She is selfcentered, hateful, uncaring, whining, fairly stupid in her reactions to events, and basically unlikable. The essential idea in this novel is about how she learns to accept herself but frankly I just didnt care. None of the other characters fare much better. They are all stereotypes in some way and have little to allow the reader to care about. theres the absent minded professor father, the really evil ones with no redeeming values, condescendingly innocent tribal people, and a beastman who becomes Edens savior in more ways than one. I keep wanting to call him Rochester for reasons that come obvious if you read the book and have a bit of knowledge of a certain Bronte book. The book became difficult to finish due to the pedestrian prose and because the situations our heroine was placed into were simply too ridiculous and too predictable. Which comes to my main complaint. Much have been written about the racist qualities of this novel which I will get into. Yet I found it to also be quite sexist. Eden loathes herself, not just her skin color but pretty much everything about her. Does she change due to any self reflective event? No, she changes due to the love of a man, a stereotypical beastman at that. Eden never learns as the author claims that real beauty comes from within. Ms Foyt appears to be essentially a romance writer after you get past the pretensions of poor sciencefiction, but do we really need to tell young girls that you need a man to fix them. Add on the fact that she doesnt really ever accept her self but becomes something else, the whole message of appreciating yourself becomes pointless. So what is the point of this book? I really have no idea. The moral is insulting. Its bad sciencefiction with no clear idea of what global warming is. The author does states that she wanted to turn the idea of racism upside down. So lets move to question number 2. 2 Is the book racist? Yes. For so many reasons it boggles the brain. I know I wont be able to list all of them. My number one thought while reading this was What was the author thinking to write that?. I will not judge the author like some reviewers by saying she is racist but there is no doubt that some of the ideas in this book could be called racist or, at the very least, extremely insensitive. 1. First of all the use of slurs. White people are Pearls while black people are Coals. The silliness of this should be obvious. To emphasize this lets take a line from the book in which Eden yells... Dont you touch me, you dirty Coal Say it out loud to get the full effect. Now lets reverse it. Remember to say it out loud... Dont you touch me, you dirty Pearl! Are you finished laughing? Doesnt have the some effect, does it? Not to mention that most of us on the first statement immediately substituted in our mind a certain word other than coal. That is how powerful, racial slurs are. In our society, the Nword is so devastating we do not even use it in writing. But if a white person is called honky or gringo there will be little reaction. The power of slurs reside in the power of the controlling party. This appears to be something the author simply does not understand. It might have made more sense if whites were called Chalks and blacks were called Ebonies, but I doubt it. Its a bad concept to start with. The author has tried to justify this by giving her own definitions to the slurs. But since she uses Coals in the book as a demeaning term her explanation simply doesnt work. I also find the idea of placing whites as the victim very troubling. If any one has talked to racists they would know that the racist sees themselves as the oppressed and the victim. I am very uncomfortable with any novel for teens setting up this as a premise and feeding into this idea whether it is intentional or not. Finally, one of the most harmful misconceptions that is implied in this book is the idea that we should be colorblind. The author implies this in her comments about her book. It is impossible to be colorblind. What we can be is aware, respectful, and appreciative of our ethnic, cultural, and racial differences but also be mindful of how our sociopolitical environment affects all of us in both obvious and subtle ways. The author seems to be unaware of this. A friend who liked this book told me I was too serious. Its a novel. It takes place in the future which might be different in the way things we perceive things. The easy answer is simply, but the author is writing in the present and that is the only way we can interpret it. If a writer is touching on such a sensitive and volatile subject it is important to do the research and understand the implications through talking with those who are affected. The author clearly did neither. But I must say some things bout the authors responses to her critics, especially since they been in such distinctive places as the Huffington Post. If I wrote anything that received so many emotional and negative responses I would want to find out why and start a dialogue. But Ms. Foyt goes the other way. She brags of the mostly positive reactions to her book yet the negative to positive replies on Goodreads and Amazon are about 4 to 1.s She claim that the blackAmerican negative response is from those who have not read the book and questions whether there is a black audience of readers to begin with. She denies the obvious blackface issues in her work and on the offensive cover then calls those who criticize the book based on the cover racist. Personally, I think those who chose not to read the book due to the cover were probably wiser and luckier than those of us who struggled through the entire book. I would hope that the author would sit down with her many critics and learn something. But that would be for her to decide. As for now, we have this very troubling novel for young adults that is both sexist and racist. Hopefully it will also be a book that most will avoid.
Veering between 3.5 and 4 stars and erring on 4.  Just finished reading Armada by Ernest Cline. I confess that Ive been waiting for this book for ages! Or at least it feels that way  you know how it is when youre really anticipating something so badly. I really enjoyed Ready Player One, in fact it was a big surprise for me because it really didnt hold any appeal and I resisted reading it in spite of all the love going round  so I did wonder how Armada would stand up. Well, this is without doubt a fun read that will appeal to many readers. Im going to be frank and say it didnt give me quite the same buzz as the first book but even so I enjoyed the ride and found it very entertaining. The story starts with Zack  a young man, on the brink of finishing his education and with his full life ahead of him  even if he is undecided about what he wants to do with it. Zack is definitely a dreamer, however, when he finds himself watching a flying saucer darting back and forth through the sky outside his classroom window he definitely snaps awake. Is he the only one to notice? And, what?? Is this space ship actually straight out of one of one of the games he plays every night? Kind of freaky! Either theres a space ship whizzing through the earths atmosphere or Zack is losing the plot! It certainly makes for a compelling start to the story. Im going to give a very quick synopsis, and I dont think this will be spoilery at all! Basically the alien threat is real. Its been real for quite some years and all those conspiracy theories  well, theyre more fact than fiction. The men in black not really but you get the picture are aware of the threat posed and have been preparing us for years for a possible alien invasion by use of film and other media and for years video gamers, playing on space invader type games, have actually been learning how to fight off such an invasion. Right here is the means of not only training but recruiting top simulator style pilots and Zack is in the top 10. All his dreams of becoming a hero overnight are about to be realised. Of course, if it was that easy then this would be a pamphlet and not a novel. There are a few counter conspiracy theories going around and basically the clock is ticking. What is the real threat here  that is the big question. What did I really enjoy about this. Its a fairly gripping narrative for the most part I hold my hands up  a few of the more detailed game parts lost me a little. I enjoyed the writing and the story and it basically had me at hello. There are so many references to songs, movies and games that I frankly lost track and theres a good deal of humour injected into the story through that very means. I liked Zack although there were a couple of occasions where I wanted to shake him just a tiny bit for being whiny and I thought that Cline does an excellent job of taking just about every sci fi film ever and referencing it here. And, frankly, I think its very cleverly done. You could spend your time saying this is a rip off of film A, B or C  but it isnt. Its supposed to be a big mismash of all these films because basically the authoritys in this book were already aware of aliens, and everything that has been created since their awareness was raised has been with that in mind  so its kind of a chicken and egg scenario  is this a take on the films, or are the films a take on the aliens. it sort of gives a certain amount of carte blanche to the author really which I thought was pretty cool although Im not really explaining my thoughts very well in that respect. What did I think pulled the story back a little  the timeframe. In one respect its this action packed wham bam type of affair, so great in terms of fast pacing and, in a way, I think that the book has been set up almost to read like an early video game with plenty of action and everything over before you even realised it began  and in that respect, again, its quite clever. But, the whole thing takes part in about two days and it feels like there is very little time for anything else. I wanted more from the characters, a bit more depth and a bit more life going on. Not boring stuff  I dont care what Zack ate for breakfast although, strangely enough, that particular detail was included!, but I would have appreciated a little bit more, particularly about the other characters who for the most part were a bit one dimensional.  Its just so very quick paced that its more like reading a graphic novel  without the graphics. For me, and this is probably one of only a very few times in my life that Ive said this, but I think this could have been expanded without any detriment. The time frame could have been lengthened slightly and the characters given more personality and feels. Criticisms aside, this is without doubt a fun read and its a great potential set up for a further book. So, fun, fast paced, action focused plot with massive appeal in terms of huge doses of pop culture references. I received a copy of this from the publishers through Netgalley for which my thanks. The above is my own opinion.
Oh, I wouldnt mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you. What a beautiful quote. It makes me a little sad to give it such a low rating. Hear me out, will you? Im guessing youre reading this, ready for me to smack talk this book. Youre just waiting for me to be a little savage and absolutely wreck it into pieces, arent you? Hmm... Well, youre certainly a little ray of sunshine : Sorry to burst your bubble, but Im not going to smack talk this book nor am I going to go wrecking it into shreds. I never wreck books, by the way. The thing with this book is, that I would have most likely enjoyed it significantly more if I had discovered it by myself, without all the hype and praise buzzing around it. If it had been a book I had never heard of before. If I had just happened to stumble into a bookstore, saw a book lying in the corner with a beautiful title, and decided to buy it  without hearing any hype around it and without people constantly saying how amazing it was and how it made them cry. I think I actually might have liked it. However, guess what spoiled it for me? Yes, you got it, you smart child... THE HYPE. At school, everybody  I kid you not  everybody, was seemingly in absolute awe; in love with this novel. Everywhere I went, people were praising it and repeating, one after another, how great it was. Obviously, I was very excited to read it. But, I felt pressured to read it too. Like it was almost obligatory, because so many people had read it. Of course, that was my own stupid fault. Hype can really make or destroy a book. And, in my case, it didnt necessarily destroy it, but it definitely, evoked a strong feeling of disappointment in me. I didnt love it. After some time, I realised, I found it average. It was one of those dramatic, but page turning, love made to doom stories. The whole concept of the novel is beautiful, certainly. I cant deny that it was extremely interesting and heart breaking to read about characters struggling with cancer. Hazel, I believe, was based on a real girl, Esther Earl. To think that people, in reality, are actually forced to go through such pain is so devastatingly sad. However, I wasnt a big fan of the writing. It was a little too philosophical for my taste. I know that some people might enjoy such writing, but if youve read my Looking for Alaska review, then you know, I feel a lot of distaste towards it. Now, before you start claiming that, in that case, I must like stupid books written in simple, ten year old language  rest assured, that is not the case. I reach for classics often. Language and writing are what I use to establish the standardlevel of a book. But, I just find it irritating when teenagers speak, like Shakespeare and sound all wise. Leave the philosophy of our existence to professionals, people who have been through wars, have experienced life longer. How can you understand something you havent properly experienced? Okay, okay, I understand that its important for young people to shape and create their own mindset, and try to figure out their way in the world, but cut out on all the Shakespeare, looking for meaning stuff, alright? Once again, I highly appreciate due to Hazel and Guss struggle with cancer, they feel the urge to already establish their mindset, in fear that they might soon leave this world. But I, in general, am not a big fan of such language. Im not claiming its dumb, Im saying, that its not a style that I enjoy reading. Look at this: .. love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have ... I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. I know it sounds marvellous, but it really isnt my taste. And, Im part of todays teenage society. I would certainly not speak like that. Also, I was so focused on liking the book that I forgot to actually enjoy it. That was what ruined it for me. I think I need to give it another go in the future. I didnt feel especially drawn to the characters either, and whilst everyone was crying towards the end, I had already been spoiled, and was expecting it all along, so I didnt shed a tear. Although it was very, very sad. Be warned. Maybe theres no particular reason, as to why I didnt enjoy it? Ive read reviews claiming how problematic the scene in the Anne Frank House was, but I didnt actually find that to be a factor contributing to my indifference towards the book. It just wasnt something for me. How did you find it?
Rating: 5 stars I JUST finished this and let me just take a breath hyperventilates OH MY GOD. I actually didnt think Id love this book so much. Simply cos I tend to stay away from all the hype. Not because Im trying to be hipster or whatever. But because I get so afraid of the book not meeting my super high expectations thanks to all the hype. This happened quite a few times to me. Which just RUINS the whole series for me cos I probably wouldve liked it if my expectations werent so high. BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. Ohhhhh, no. This book met my expectations and went far and beyond them. Okay, I suppose I should try and do a proper review by starting with a brief synopsis. Im afraid that otherwise this would just turn into a Love Rant about Peeta. The story is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lives in a dystopian world where the earth has exhausted all its resources and the land is divided into 12 different districts, each focusing on the production of a certain good. All of which is controlled by the Capitol. Every year the Hunger Games are held for everyone to watch. The Hunger Games is basically a morbid BattleRoyalecumWorldCup event where one boy and girl from each district are sent to the Capitol and then put into an arena where they have to kill each other off. The last one standing would be the victor and heshe and hisher entire district will be rewarded with food and other amenities that are sorely lacking in places outside of the Capitol. That is the gist of it. And Katniss has to choose between dying and killing. Dying would mean an honourable death and sort of flipping the finger at the Capitol who is manipulative and playing God with peoples lives. But killing and staying alive would be fueling the games and playing right into the Capitols hands. Also, things are made complicated with Peeta, the boy tribute from her district district 12, who is clearly in love with her and would protect her, even at the expense of his life. Would Katniss bear to kill him to be the victor? THIS BOOK IS PACKED WITH ACTION. And I dont mean just random fight scenes thrown in. I mean edgeofseat life or death situations and survival situations that the readers can only imagine in absolute horror. Its sort of Survivor the reality show meets Battle Royale. So there is tons of mind games that helps with the tension throughout the book. I was suspicious of everyone, even Rue. I was so sure she was gonna stab Katniss in the back, literally. But that flower scene broke my heart. Simply cos Katniss merged the identity of her younger sister, Prim with Rue her competitor and she ended up feeling as though she was fighting against her own sister. The pacing and writing is really spoton. I never felt that any scene was too draggy. Even when Katniss was starving or dehydrating. I thought it would be pretty boring but the way it is written, I was still rooting for her. Willing her to stay alive that I was kept engaged throughout the book. AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE TWISTS. HOLY CRAP. My heart literally skipped a beat each time a twist was introduced into the story and totally changed the course of where I thought the plot was heading. It was totally unpredictable and I was so confused and kinda scared of what might lay ahead. But that was whats SO GREAT about this book. Characters were ALSO great! I liked every one of them. Even the villains, even the Capitol, cos they were so morbid and strange. It was like reading of a new species altogether. Katniss was a great protagonist. She was strong, resourceful and hardened by life which means that she wasnt the usual whiny heroine we tend to read about in YA novels. Plus, shes totally badass with the bow  arrow. She can easily pass of as a Ninja and that is the highest compliment I can give ANY character. I do get abit annoyed with her as she seems a total devoid of emotion. And everything she does is calculated and done with a motive behind it. Even the funeral she staged for one of the tributes wont say who, though it was done out of respect. I felt that she just wanted to show the Capitol up. And her love scenes with Peeta. It was all... an act. Literally. Which BREAKS MY HEART cos I know how much Peeta loved her. Although I doubt she realizes how much she is relying on Peeta and sort of falling for him, she is all too aware of her relationship with Gale her childhood friend back home to let any of her feelings develop. It was like trampling on flower buds before they popped out of the ground. Such a waste. And Peeta. OH PEETA. Peeta, Peeta, Peeta... I am so in love with him. Its not even funny. I mean, yea, to be fair there wasnt enough airtime on Gale for me to feel for him. Although I do find him chivalrous and there is a something true about his partnership with Katniss and the way he looks out for her. But as awesome as I think Gale is, Peeta is just... amazing. Hes so gentle and awkward, thanks to the fact that he isnt nearly as badass as Gale and Katniss. But despite his shortcomings he tries his best to keep Katniss alive, even though there were times when I thought he had abandoned her. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DOUBTED HIM. Katniss kept emphasizing how good Peeta was at acting in love with her for the audience who were watching the hunger games. But we readers knew better. He wouldve done ANYTHING for her. ANYTHING. And my love for him just quadruples with each pages. Until finally my heart was wrenching in pain at the end of the book. I got really pissed off at Katniss. make up YOUR MIND WOMAN I felt so bad for Peeta cos I knew that the relationship was very onesided, but he pumped so much love into it that it was completely believable and sincere, looking almost whole. Okay, I should stop gushing about Peeta and mention other characters I enjoyed. I liked Cinna, Caesar, Cato and Clove. Dunno why they all happen to start with the letter C, thats strange. The only downside to this book is that I felt that the characterization wasnt thorough enough. I wanted to know more about the characters to make them less 2D. Even Peeta and Katniss, I felt like I needed to learn more about them. But I guess there will be more of that in the next 2 books in the trilogy. I also particularly enjoyed the flashbacks about Katnisss father and his connection with Mockingjays. This back story really allowed me to relate with Katniss more and made her character more likeable, as otherwise, I felt that she was kinda heartless at times. I was so relieved to see the softer side to her. Overall, this book is totally EPIC. Its the only word to describe it. It also left me breathless quite a few times and I had to stop reading for fear of what would happen next. That is usually a good thing and an indicator of the Thrill level this story has. Im glad that the hype on this series is not misguided and welldeserved. I am looking forward to the next two books as I wonder what is next after the Hunger Games are over. What would happen then? Gritty fastpaced writing laced with lovely characters and the constant foreshadowing of something darker, more dyer up ahead. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
4th read August 2017 How do I love Six of Crows? Let me count the ways... If you dont know, and you should by now, since I mention this duology pretty frequently, this is a heist story. I love heists hit me up with your heist recommendations if you have any, so this plot was always going to be a winner for me. But, on my fourth read, what really stands out is just how exciting this story still is after all this time. Its a quick read, respite the enormous size of this paperback, and it also manages to have a lot of character depth. You have six protagonists, five of which have their own POVs and yet we also get these intricate backstories. Basically I could talk about the perfection of this book all day, every day, so dont get me started! For more bookish content check out www.cartonmanettedarnay.wordpress.com 1st Read January 2016 Um, so why in the world did it take me so long to get this book? Im hoping to get a proper review up sometime tomorrow, so see you then So, the majority of this review will be ever so spoilery, but fear not I will warn you when we reach that part. Ive only Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo, and I loved it so why I havent finished the series is a mystery, by typically me. I wouldnt say you needed to read that trilogy before you read Six of Crows because they are not connected, however would definitely say you should either read the whole trilogy or not to have read any of it. Because I had read Shadow and Bone, I knew enough about the characters and the world to pick up on a few things that I think gave away a pretty important plot point. It is a bit frustrating because, like I said, if I hadnt read Shadow and Bone, I would never have picked up on it since it was such a fleeting reference, but what can you do? I still intend to read the whole trilogy at some point in the future, but am definitely more exited for the sequel to Six of Crows. Leigh Bardugo is such a beautiful writer, which can be seen throughout this 500 page book. The narrative is so fast paced and so full of twists and turns that the books feels almost like a heist film. Like IaEURtmve already said, I am familiar with the world, and it was just and interesting and vivid as I remember. I am a city girl at heart so I did prefer to hear about the bustling city life of Ketterdam that what we saw in Shadow and Bone, but thataEURtms just me. Bardugo successfully created this beautifully gritty city that is still so vivid in my mind that I feel as though IaEURtmve been there, and as grim a place it is, I sort of want to go back under Dregs protection, of course. There were no parts that I thought could be cut out or were superfluous which meant that I was gripped by the whole 500 pages. In fact, I loved this book so much that I put off reading it, just so that it would last for longer, which is a fist for me. I have always been a lover of heist plots so it was always going to be a win, and this one was just something else. I just really cannot sing the praises of this book enough. So now is the time that I am delving into things that may be considered spoilers but they are not plot related. The reason for this is because the main reason I love this book so much is because of the ships, all of the ships. Now, if you dont consider the ships to be spoilers you may already be aware of them then by all means read on. So there were two ships that I was 100 invested in and the first was Kaz and Inej. Kaz is definitely my favourite character because he was so complex and so flawed. I can just tell that he will be one of my alltime favourite characters for years to come. One of the things that I loved about the characters in this book was that every one of them have their own backstory that make them who they are, including Kaz. He has certain issues that make him really quite vulnerable and yet despite this he was also so strong. I think this can be said for all of the characters involved in the heist, that they showed how you can be both strong and vulnerable and the same time, and that having a weakness does not make you weak. I think it was endearing to see how much he cares for Inej, and viceversa. But while it was super cute, there was a certain point where Kaz asked her to do something and she made a really good point. That point being that neither could aEURcureaEURtm each otheraEURtms weaknessaEURtm, something which you see in YA fiction frequently, but not here. The other ship that IaEURtmd been on board since his first chapter is Nina and Matthias. Who doesnaEURtmt love a relationship that blurs the line between love and hate so much. Both, but especially Matthias, have so much confusion and uncertainty over what they feel it makes their relationship seem so real. I adored how sassy Nina was, even since they first met and how serious Mathias was, which meant that they sort of bounced off each other. TheyaEURtmre a couple who just shouldnaEURtmt work but they do, and they do it so so well. Neither of them are perfect, and I was swearing at Matthias at a certain point, but they both want to atone for their sins and thataEURtms what I like about them. For a change I actually was able to relate to both Inej and Nina, and found myself loving the friendship between them. Also Matthias sounds very hot, and IaEURtmm not complaining. On the subject of hot guys, IaEURtmd definitely say that Kaz, in my mind at least, was also pretty fine. Dare I go as far as to say that the sequel to this book is my most anticipated book of the year? Yes, I think I do. I wouldnaEURtmt even be surprised if this is my book of the year, because itaEURtms definitely a very, very strong contender. Either way Six of Crows has right up to being one of my top five favourite books ever!
...In my life, the one thing I have learned above all is that no individual can reach the height of their potential without the love of others. We are not meant to be alone, Shahrzad. The more a person pushes others away, the clearer it becomes he is in need of love the most. After reading Calamity by Brandon Sanderson, I dont have any idea what to read next. I decided to find some matching colors with the cover and I found The Wrath  The Dawn, one of my birthday book haul, and wished to read, to be the book that I was going to read next. I am not fond of reading the synopsis of the book, I usually eyed them and figured out why was the cover design looks like something elegant and exquisite. And so, the reading started. The Wrath and The Dawn is a retelling of One Thousand and One Nights. Honestly? I dont have any idea what was the story or the tale of One Thousand and One Nights is all about. I am familiar with the name but there was never a time in which I stumbled upon the story to read or watched it until The Wrath and The Dawn. And I am definitely happy that I this kind of novel is existing. I dont know what to feel about the story of One Thousand and One Nights in which retold on The Wrath and The Dawn. I could feel the pain, the misery, the longing, the regret, the sadness and above all  the sorrow in which laid upon to Khalid, the Caliph, the Kings of the King. I was not aware of the storyline so you could imagine how utterly shocked I was when I was on the part where they revealed why women die when the dawn reaches another sunlight. I admit this, I get bored on the first few pages of the book. I was not hooked, it does not piqued my interest however I think anyone can understand it because, maybe, I was not yet moved on from the third book of Reckoners Trilogy, Calamity, in which for everyone knows gave me a lot of twisted plot and undesirable emotions that led me back into feels trip. But as I was typing this, I promised you, I learn to love the story, I dissolved in their emotions, I have conflicted with their decisions, I was intoxicated by their actions. The characters are well made and it feels like they are real. Prove that a real man doesnt make a show of whats his. It just is. Is it? Are you mine? Khalid asked with quiet solemnity. Her conviction wavered further. I told you; dont try to own me. I dont want to own you. She swiveled her neck to meet his gaze. Then never speak of sending me away again. I am not yours to with as you will. Khalids features smoothed knowingly.How right you are. You are not mine. He dropped his palm from the door. I am yours. It was probably a bit hard at the start of the story because there are a lot of foreign names that you dont know of and it was not the usual names that Ive been reading. It made me confuse, I think that was the dragging part of the first few chapters of the book but as the reading went on, I learn to like their names. I became so fond of it and find it amusing to have that kind of name and made me think, what could be the meaning or the reason why a name like that exist or such a lovely name blessed to the character. I remembered when I was on page 67 when I started to love the book. I dont know why but I think this book is refreshing on my part. It was written in third persons perspective that gave me a new feeling on reading. I think the books that Ive been choosing for this year was always written on the first point of view. It made sense and the writing style of Renee Ahdieh is captivating. I never across such a magnificent author who can manipulate and collide words with such beauty, passion and admiration. Do you know what I love about this book? THAT BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED ENDING. It was broken and yet satisfying. Longedfull and yet painful. Disastrous and yet historical. I wanted to scream everything out when I read that ending. I never expected nor across it with my brain to have that kind of ending. I couldnt grasp the conviction and I couldnt get a glimpse of hatred  I could feel that everything is out of pure love. And thats pretty amazing and dangerous. My heart aches for her characters  for I feel their emotions inside me, I could feel that Khalid is facing an extreme attraction that cannot be fulfilled, that Shahrzad is battling out the struggles of her heart to the power of need and love, that Despina is inflicted by the hollow love and the intimidating hierarchy that made her feel she doesnt anything deserving on her terms, and Jalal who smiles and flirts around intentionally or not with his playful knowledge and brilliant vocabulary lies a lonely man, who is longing for true love. This fastpaced literature will bring you the thrilling and despiteful experience of love and the consequences that you need to fight with the unwanted sacrifices that have to be made. You will love this amazing book for what is it and definitely, you will yearn for more of their stories, for what will happen next. And I am thankful that I read The Wrath and The Dawn with so much attention and passion. I am thankful that I didnt drop it halfway and I continue to seek for the ending. I am thankful that I read such a marvelous book that will hold dear to my heart. Thank you Renee Ahdieh for writing a novel that will engrave to my heart. My ratings: 5 stars!! What are you doing to me, you plague of a girl? He whispered. If Im a plague, then you should keep your distance, unless you plan on being destroyed. The weapons still in her grasp, she shoved against his chest. No. His hands dropped to her waist. Destroy me.
My life isnt made for you, its made for no one but me, its the price I pay for taking lives that dont Belong to me. I gritted through a clinched jaw. Hoping she would back the f away from me. I started reading this book as soon as it landed on my kindle. I knew, prior to going in, that this book would destroy me in ways that no other book did. Even me preaching this to myself the entire time never did I expect it would be worse than what I had predicted. This book doesnt just grip your heart. It doesnt just shatter your heart into a million tiny pieces all to be mended back together again. This book is a complete mind f. This book will f with you in ways you where no expecting. Its dark. Its enthralling. Its breathtaking. Its soul capturing. Its passionate. Its sexy as hell. El Diablo is definitely in the running of book of the decade...not just book of the year. I have wrote and rewrote things trying to adequately describe this story and no matter what I write it wont be adequately enough. This story is like the other Good O Boys Standalones. It starts early in their lives giving us an idea of who they are as kids. El Diablo starts off when Alejandro is a young boy just doing what most boys do but yet his life is different. Why You Ask??? Well, you see his Father is a very dangerous and powerful man. He makes Alejandro grow up way faster than a child should and makes does everything in his power to show him that he, too, will be a ruthless bastard and that he will take over the family business. Alejandro knows the life he is destined to have isnt a pretty one. He tries to have a normal one but that just doesnt happen when you are a Martinez. He feels he has absolutely no choice and that he is destined to go to hell. He is forced into situations that no child should have to be placed into but he holds his head high and does what he is told or else ... He is a Martinez after all. This was just the stepping stones that leads Alejandro to become the most feared man alive. Making him EL DIABLO. Lexi is the true angel in this book indeed. She, like Alejandro, doesnt have a fairytale childhood. Her mother self absorbs herself into alcohol and drugs not minding that she has a daughter to raise. Her step father, tries to do what he can and raise Lexi the right way. But we soon realize that her step dad isnt a good guy either. And Lexi is left to have to live in a world of unhappiness except when it comes to ballet. Ballet is all she has. Lexi is breathtakingly beautiful. She is selfless. She is strong. She is stubborn. And when is later face to face with El Diablo himself she doesnt fear him like she should. I am not afraid of you Alejandro. Alejandro is a profoundly guarded man with layer upon layer, who lives a treacherous life filled with enemies from all quarters who will stop at nothing to see him 6 feet under. He was molded to become ruthless like his father but her surpasses that but it throws him down an even more darker hole that makes him soon think being dead would be better than being alive. You will be taken down a powerful road that showcases just how much these two have gone through as what they have lost. You will want to hate Martinez but you will fall in love with him more than you will hate him. He truly is a damaged soul and you will see how these two divide and conquer. How these two grow close and then have it all stripped away multiple times. How these two find themselves on the very edge or a dark cliff not sure how to find their way back. I watched her sleep. Protecting her the only way I knew how. Except there was no protecting her..... FROM. ME. These two test each other also. Martinez does everything he can to push her away and Lexi does everything to show him that she wants to be there for him. Lexi tries to show him that she sees what lies just below the surface of El Diablo and that he is deep down a good guy but Martinez wont have it. He has never known himself as a good guy and he isnt about to now ...at least that is what he tries to tell himself but Lexi is stubborn and sees the good in him. Dont fing touch me. Im warning you. What is it going to take for you to realize Im no good for you?! I shouted, Raking my hands through my wet hair. Everything these characters do in this story, as well as her other books, there is a reason. You will find through this book that there will questions unanswered but have faith....M always gives us everything we need. You will be spellbound. Martinez will cast a spell on you and will have you foaming at the mouth like your seizing. This is not like her Ms other books. Yes, it will shatter your heart into a million piecesliving you in a haze only M can deliver where you literally feel broken but this book does something more than the others. It MIND Fs YOU Giving you a whole new meaning to the word fed UP. I am never disappointed in reading a Monica Robinson book. I usually will think, WOW...I seriously dont see how it can get any better. But too soon do I get the wake up call of the century with the next one being even better. This book is a book that I so desperately wish I could give 10, 20, 30 or more stars for. Its much more deserving than just 5 star quality. I received this book as an ARC in exchange for an honest review.
This review can also be found at  Celaena is an assassin, living in a nation where a king has taken over, banned magic, and enslaved criminals like herself. One day, she is summoned from her work in the salt mines of Endovier and brought to Dorian, Prince of Adarlan, where he asks her to be his Champion in a competition for the King. Thinking of escape and a life beyond the salt mines, and eventually the castle, she accepts. She is brought to the castle, where she trains and takes part in tests against other Champions, leading up to a final duel to determine the winner. Much is at stake, if she loses, she may be sent back to Endovier. But her opponents are turning up dead, horribly mutilated in the hallways of the castle. Chaol, the Captain of the Guard, trains and spends time with her, and along with Prince Dorian, he thinks he might be dealing with feelings for the assassin. But romance will only make things more complicated for Celaena, as she realizes that more is going on in this castle than it seems. So originally when I saw this book, I didnt have much interest. Im more into urban fantasy, vampires, werewolves, all that good stuff. After constantly seeing praise for this series, I finally gave in and decided Id give it a try. I actually really, really liked this! Im so happy that I ended up buying a copy, because if I had borrowed this from the library, Id just end up getting myself the book anyways because its the kind of book that you have to own, you have to see it on your shelves, you have to buy the next in the series, not just borrow it. What I mean is, its the kind of book that even if its not perfect, I enjoyed it enough that Ill probably end up rereading it at some point. So I absolutely loved the world of Adarlan. I hated what the king had done, but the descriptions of the setting, and the history, seemed so real and well thought out. I was captivated by the people of Adarlan, and the royals, and the castle! Everything just seemed to make perfect sense in context, I never had to reread passages to understand why something was going on, or even what was happening in the first place, as I often do with fantasy stories. Overall the setting was just amazing. And then there are the characters. Celaena, the main character, Adarlans Assassin, was interesting, and likeable, and while I didnt like everything that she did, I always liked her. She was extremely determined and strong. I also have to mention that she was fairly feminine, which I appreciated because Ive noticed that a lot of the more badass characters, even female ones, are portrayed as masculine, therefore frequently equating masculinity with true badassery. Of course, theres nothing wrong with being masculine, but to have a character be a nice mix of masculine AND feminine, with the feminine side portrayed as just as important as the other sides of her.... it was a nice change. The love interests, Chaol and Dorian, were both likeable as well, just as they were different. I thought they both had their qualities and I could see why they liked Celaena, and why she might like them both in return. I also like that they werent just ornaments on the sidelines....the narration gave the reader a look into their thoughts every now and then which helped me to understand them better! I really appreciated this as well. The other Champions, and the mysterious deaths, brought some suspense and tension to the book. Cain, a particularly unlikeable Champion, really stood out from the others for obvious reasons, however this wasnt always a good thing, in my opinion. I wont say much because I dont want to give it away, but the way that the author focused on Cain....I knew what was going on with him chapters before the truth was revealed. Nehemia, the princess of Eyllwe, happens to be visiting the castle when Celaena is taking part in the competition, and they develop a friendship. This friendship brought out the softer side of Celaena, in my opinion, because she had empathy for what Nehemia and her people were dealing with concerning the King and his army, and this connection brought them together in ways that I thought made the book even better. The mix of romance and the love triangle with this friendship made for a great balance between the two forces, so the level of romance wasnt overpowering, but it remained significant enough for me, as a romance lover. I had a bit of an issue with the pacing at times. Some of the scenes seemed a bit drawn out, which annoyed me, and dropped this book from a five star read to a four star rating. Overall, I really enjoyed this fantasy novel. I loved that the main character was badass and feminine at the same time, I think that the love interests were well written, and I loved the friendship between Celaena and Nehemia. While the pacing was a bit too slow at times, the mystery behind the Champions deaths kept me reading. I am excited to read the next book! I recommend this to those looking for great young adult fantasy reads. Even if youre not a big fan of fantasy, you might change your mind after reading this book!
Actual Rating: 4.75 stars This was my first Colleen Hoover book and Im happy to say that it was a success. Ive honestly struggled for a while with whether or not I was ever going to read a Colleen Hoover book because Ive heard so many mixed things. I own Slammed and it companions because my cousin bought them and read them, but said that they were just ok. Then Ive heard people say that her books are the best and some who say theyre just too much. So the dilemma was...which book do I start with, which book do I let be my first impression of Colleen Hoover. For whatever reason, I really wanted to read Ugly Love and so here we are! I really loved this book. I enjoyed all of the characters, the dynamics of their relationships and the struggles they had to endure and push through. It was all really entertaining and stressful to read. Tate Collins is a college graduate pursing her masters degree in nursing and living with her older pilot brother Corbin, while she gets on her feet. She meets Corbins friend and next door neighbor Miles on her first day there and sparks immediately fly. Only Miles is closed off, hes a wall that cant be penetrated. Ugly Love follows Tate and Miles on that journey of battling a past that created those walls in order to try and pave out a future. However, in the process of doing that, things get Ugly. The best thing a new adult book can give you in my opinion, is characters that you enjoy. And I definitely liked both of these characters. I like that Tate is her own woman and is focused on herself and her career and trying to make a better life for herself. I liked Miles and his brooding sexiness. I liked that when he wasnt being closed off and haunted by his mysterious past, he was fun and charming. However, there were some moments where I was really pissed off and annoyed with Miles and the way he treated Tate. In retrospect, I do UNDERSTAND his behavior, but his past and what he went through doesnt JUSTIFY it. You dont go around treating people like crap because youve had a messed up life. That my dear Miles, is unacceptable. I liked the relationship between Tate and Corbin as well. Even though theyre much older now and are both very mature adults, Corbin is still protective of his sister and only wants the best for her, in life and in her relationships. I even liked the relationship forged between Tate and the old Elevator button pusher man, Cap. It was fun reading his little tidbits and words of wisdom any time Tate was having a particularly rough time dealing with the arrangement between her and Miles. While I did really love this story and the characters and how everything played out in the end. I do resent one thing in particular. The story is told in dual pov. The chapters from Tates point of view are told in the present and follow everything that is happening between her and Miles and how shes dealing with the feelings shes developing while he continuously pushes and pulls on her emotions. The chapters from Miles point of view chronicle events from six years earlier and gradually reveal what events lead to Miles being the man he is in present day. Now the thing I resent is the fact that while both Miles and Tate are going through this painful relationship or arrangement, Miles story, background and reasoning behind his actions and his pain is so much more complex and sophisticated than Tates. Its like....even though the majority of the story feels like its about Tate and how shes dealing with everything, her plight and pain pales in comparison to what Miles went through. Tates pain is predicated on the fact that she simply refused to give up on something that was so very clearly unhealthy and putting her through a world of pain. She was so in lust and drawn in by Miles and what they had going on, that regardless to how many times he unintentionally disrespected her or hurt her feelings, she would not put an end to it. Where as Miles history and the ghosts in his closet were very profound and real and was painful to read. While reading, I just felt like wow...this story is about Tate and her journey with this man, but really this is Miles story. Not that anything is wrong with that but if this is the story youre telling and its supposed to be about them BOTH, then make BOTH of their pain profound. Why does Miles story have to be heart wrenching and tear inducing, while Tates story just elicits a few shouts of GIRL JUST LET HIM GO! Miles story is about love and the loss of love and family, and Tates is just about some dude that shes interested it. It gets annoying having the women essentially get the shaft while the men constantly get these complicated and multifaceted story liens is all Im saying. With all that being said, I do understand why everyone is so enthralled with Colleen Hoover and her work. I was invested in this story from beginning to end. There wasnt a moment while reading where I felt bored or like I didnt care about what was happening. The writing was great and I loved the way some chapters were written as if there were a poem to show the beauty in the story and how it switched back and fourth when the love got Ugly. I really loved this book and will definitely be reading more of her work. I cannot wait for this movie to come out because I will be there on OPENING NIGHT! Many people suggested reading Hopeless as an introduction to Colleen Hoover but Ive heard a few things about that book and I just think it would have been a bit too heavy for me. I would personally suggest reading this book if youve never read anything by Colleen Hoover. It has JUST the right balance of Love and Pain.
I received this book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Thanks so much to the publisher for granting me the opportunity to read an ARC of this. Charles Wang moved to America from China with nothing. And with nothing but a brain made for success, and just a little bit of knowledge about manure, he built himself a multimillion dollar cosmetics empire. He has three children: Saina is a New Yorkbased artist whos juggling her love life. Andrews in university and is aspiring to be a standup comedian, and Grace is still in high school, but her sense of style and fashion blog dominate her life more than academics ever could. When the financial crisis comes rolling into town, Charless reluctance to listen to his financial advisors proves to be his downfall; in a blink of an eye, Charles loses everything: his house, his estates, his companies, even his car. In an effort to gather whats remaining of his pride, he decides to take his family back to China where his ancestral lands are surely awaiting his return. And so begins a road trip from Los Angeles to New York, in a beatup car with a family contained inside that has no idea whats in store for them. You know sometimes you read a synopsis, and you are sure that you need the book in your life? The Wangs vs. the World was that book for me. It sounded like a hilarious, lighthearted read revolving around the sheer entertainment of the richestorags trope, with a heartwarming tale about the importance of family at its core. I think that was my problem with this book: I went into it with preconceived notions about what I would receive. And while it did deliver on some of these fronts, the overall experience was severely underwhelming. For starters, this is not a richestorags novel. I wanted to see these rich, spoiled kids try to navigate a world where youre not handed everything on a silver platter. I wanted to see them struggle with their new lifestyle, and we didnt get any of that. If it had even been a little bit of the book, I might have enjoyed it more instead of just enjoying one scene here, another over there. The book promises some laughs, and you get them. Chang writes with snark. Her language is often crude, but never gratuitously so. She has a talent when it comes to hooks. This book starts off by clearly establishing Changs voice just the right amount of vulgar, just the right amount of intelligent snark. Case and point: America was the worst part of it because America, that fickle bitch, used to love Charles Wang. Please note that this is quoted from an ARC, and might not be in the final product. But despite having a strong, intelligent voice, and despite its promising synopsis, this novel fell flat. I suspect that has something to do with the characters. I wont say that they were onedimensional or flat, because that is not true. In fact, they felt quite like real people people that I interact with almost every day. But I just didnt like them, and I dont think that was the intention here. I didnt care about their passions, or their motivations in life. I didnt relate to them, and so I wasnt immersed in the experience. Watching characters lives unfold in front of your eyes while youre stuck behind a thick wall perforated with holes thats what this book felt like. You know the people on the other side are real, and you know most of what is going on, but you just cant get to them. Ultimately, there are better things in life than looking into these peoples lives, so looking at them becomes a chore rather than an enjoyment. Which is how I felt by the 50 mark of the book I was only reading to get to the end, rather than reading to find out what happened next. With characters out of the way, lets talk about the plot. There was none. If you were to ask me what this book was about, I would not be able to tell you anything apart from what I just stated above as the synopsis. Most of that happens within the first 25 of the novel, and after that mark, its a lot of introspection on the characters parts, a lot of dialogue, a lot of flashbacks that dont seem to contribute anything to the story, but are rather used as devices to flesh out the characters. You can argue that there was a climax, but it can hardly be called that. And despite there being several different storylines in play, I cant really say that I was invested in even one of them. However, I can appreciate The Wangs. vs the World for its thematic material. I enjoyed looking at the Wangss family dynamics; I have grown so accustomed to reading about broken, fractured families in American literature, and I have never related to that. It was refreshing to see family dynamics that I could see myself in: overbearing parents who ultimately love you more than anything else in the world, close relationships with siblings, the realization that home is where your family is. Thats not something that I see too often in the books that I read, so it was muchneeded. Moreover, Jade Chang explores things like micro aggressions, the myth of the model minority, racial stereotypes, etc. It so aptly depicts the lovehate relationship many of us have with America. And not only that, but these themes were seamlessly integrated into the novel without ever seeming inyourface. What did seem inyourface was the unapologetic use of untranslated Chinese, which I saw many complaints about on the Goodreads page, but I dont complain. I felt it was done intentionally maybe even making a statement, that I fully admired. Sure, it was a little alarming to be missing the exact meaning of some parts of the text, but thats okay. No writer should have to accommodate a reader who is reading a galley on a digital device, but is feeling too entitled to look up the translations of a few words. Ultimately, I would recommend this book to anyone who is mainly concerned with writing style and a compelling voice, rather than the plot. If you are someone who looks at themes before anything else in a novel, this is for you. And if you are a person who can enjoy a book without necessarily feeling anything towards the characters, you will be fine. In other words, this book has a lot going for it  it just wasnt for me.

4th read August 2017 How do I love Six of Crows? Let me count the ways... If you dont know, and you should by now, since I mention this duology pretty frequently, this is a heist story. I love heists hit me up with your heist recommendations if you have any, so this plot was always going to be a winner for me. But, on my fourth read, what really stands out is just how exciting this story still is after all this time. Its a quick read, respite the enormous size of this paperback, and it also manages to have a lot of character depth. You have six protagonists, five of which have their own POVs and yet we also get these intricate backstories. Basically I could talk about the perfection of this book all day, every day, so dont get me started! For more bookish content check out www.cartonmanettedarnay.wordpress.com 1st Read January 2016 Um, so why in the world did it take me so long to get this book? Im hoping to get a proper review up sometime tomorrow, so see you then So, the majority of this review will be ever so spoilery, but fear not I will warn you when we reach that part. Ive only Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo, and I loved it so why I havent finished the series is a mystery, by typically me. I wouldnt say you needed to read that trilogy before you read Six of Crows because they are not connected, however would definitely say you should either read the whole trilogy or not to have read any of it. Because I had read Shadow and Bone, I knew enough about the characters and the world to pick up on a few things that I think gave away a pretty important plot point. It is a bit frustrating because, like I said, if I hadnt read Shadow and Bone, I would never have picked up on it since it was such a fleeting reference, but what can you do? I still intend to read the whole trilogy at some point in the future, but am definitely more exited for the sequel to Six of Crows. Leigh Bardugo is such a beautiful writer, which can be seen throughout this 500 page book. The narrative is so fast paced and so full of twists and turns that the books feels almost like a heist film. Like IaEURtmve already said, I am familiar with the world, and it was just and interesting and vivid as I remember. I am a city girl at heart so I did prefer to hear about the bustling city life of Ketterdam that what we saw in Shadow and Bone, but thataEURtms just me. Bardugo successfully created this beautifully gritty city that is still so vivid in my mind that I feel as though IaEURtmve been there, and as grim a place it is, I sort of want to go back under Dregs protection, of course. There were no parts that I thought could be cut out or were superfluous which meant that I was gripped by the whole 500 pages. In fact, I loved this book so much that I put off reading it, just so that it would last for longer, which is a fist for me. I have always been a lover of heist plots so it was always going to be a win, and this one was just something else. I just really cannot sing the praises of this book enough. So now is the time that I am delving into things that may be considered spoilers but they are not plot related. The reason for this is because the main reason I love this book so much is because of the ships, all of the ships. Now, if you dont consider the ships to be spoilers you may already be aware of them then by all means read on. So there were two ships that I was 100 invested in and the first was Kaz and Inej. Kaz is definitely my favourite character because he was so complex and so flawed. I can just tell that he will be one of my alltime favourite characters for years to come. One of the things that I loved about the characters in this book was that every one of them have their own backstory that make them who they are, including Kaz. He has certain issues that make him really quite vulnerable and yet despite this he was also so strong. I think this can be said for all of the characters involved in the heist, that they showed how you can be both strong and vulnerable and the same time, and that having a weakness does not make you weak. I think it was endearing to see how much he cares for Inej, and viceversa. But while it was super cute, there was a certain point where Kaz asked her to do something and she made a really good point. That point being that neither could aEURcureaEURtm each otheraEURtms weaknessaEURtm, something which you see in YA fiction frequently, but not here. The other ship that IaEURtmd been on board since his first chapter is Nina and Matthias. Who doesnaEURtmt love a relationship that blurs the line between love and hate so much. Both, but especially Matthias, have so much confusion and uncertainty over what they feel it makes their relationship seem so real. I adored how sassy Nina was, even since they first met and how serious Mathias was, which meant that they sort of bounced off each other. TheyaEURtmre a couple who just shouldnaEURtmt work but they do, and they do it so so well. Neither of them are perfect, and I was swearing at Matthias at a certain point, but they both want to atone for their sins and thataEURtms what I like about them. For a change I actually was able to relate to both Inej and Nina, and found myself loving the friendship between them. Also Matthias sounds very hot, and IaEURtmm not complaining. On the subject of hot guys, IaEURtmd definitely say that Kaz, in my mind at least, was also pretty fine. Dare I go as far as to say that the sequel to this book is my most anticipated book of the year? Yes, I think I do. I wouldnaEURtmt even be surprised if this is my book of the year, because itaEURtms definitely a very, very strong contender. Either way Six of Crows has right up to being one of my top five favourite books ever!
This review was done by KissinBlueKaren See my other reviews of books in this series. Throne of Glass Crown of Midnight Heir of Fire Queen of Shadows is book 4 in the Throne of Glass series. This book contains a ton of conflict resolution. Alliances are made and major things gets fixed. Of course, some new issues come up, things that have to be resolved before a happily ever after is possible. I am not going to lie. I read the early reviews of Queen of Shadows and became really worried about the fate of this series and my enjoyment of this book. It turns out that, for me, nothing could stop me from enjoying this book. This read was just as addictive and epic as everything else I have read in this series. This review contains spoilers for earlier books in the Throne of Glass series. This book brings us right into Rifthold, Celaenas old stomping grounds as a training assassin. There we find characters familiar from the novellas in Assassins Blade. Abroynn and Celaena are going to talk about the past and hash out who is the best trickster. Although the people may look familiar, Celaena is not the same person she was in Throne of Glass. She has been growing as a character and now she is now Aelin through and through. She is still an absolute badass, but since she got to really be Fae, she doesnt want to go back to just being Celaena anymore. Facing people from her past is going to solidify her future. In this book we see her making real progress toward claiming her place as the Queen of Terrasen. She is setting up her court, making real plans to enact justice, and setting up alliances for the future. There is still the issue of a few missing wyrdkeys so there is a lot of potentially epic fight scenes and in half of this book we see Aelin sneaking around and setting things up for the future. This was awesome from her and a bit frustrating. Wheres the trust? But there is so much more going on that I was really distracted by everyone else and their drama. So I found other places to put my interest. One of the main people in the dark from Aelins actions is Chaol. Chaol has also done a lot of learning and growing throughout the series. One thing remains absolutely clear for him thou, he is absolutely loyal to Dorian no matter what. Since Dorian isnt really himself anymore this creates major conflict for Chaol. How to be loyal at this point? For anyone still holding out hope for Celaena and Chaol, I am here to tell you that that ship has sunk. Chaol needs to starts looking at other options, but he doesnt have to look very far. But then... Rowan is absent from the beginning of this story, but dont worry, he shows up at just the perfect moment for Aelin. Rowan and Aelin still have issues. Aelin is going to mishandle this man throughout this story. They are moving toward something, but it is at a turtles pace. Rowan and Aelin are a complex ship, still, that hopefully gets hashed out in future installments. Rowen and Aedion finally meet face to face, and it is a beautiful thing to behold. Even though I was highly anticipating Aelin and Aedion meeting, his admiration and similarity to Rowan was the thing that really stuck with me. We are going to meet with some characters and make new alliances here. I got one word for this, Lysandra. Manons part gets major attention. Manon meets a girl names Elide and everything is going to be questioned. Elide and Kaitlin are going to play into Manons next moves. You may remember Katlain from ...an earlier book in the series. I want to say Throne of Glass, but I might be wrong here. Manon and Abraxos are still an unstoppable team. We dont get as much Abraxos as I was hoping for but his actions in this story made me really wonder and speculate about him. Abraxos is almost like Manons conscience in this story. Manon and her thirteen are going to get even more awesome in this story. We get some insight into how a witch gets a heart and what their love looks like. We also learn about all kinds of cross breeding. I loved that this book solved some major conflict, but I am now a bit worried that this face off with the creatures in Morath is going to...something probably epic. I am doing some major shipping for this series. First of course, I am so happy to point out that Rowan and Aelin are a thing. Yes! I do love being right. What I couldnt understand about this was Aelin acting like a school girl with that lingerie. Rowan is, like, immortal, and too old for these games. Thats not to say that I dont understand what she trying to do. I just think her actions showed her age. Also, can we talk about Lysandra for a minute. Her powers are awesome! She is a shifter and tbh I would pick a beautiful person to shift into, as well. But then she has that ghost leopard thing and her character goes from extra in the cast to badass heroine in her own right. I am so glad Aelin found a female friend. Its just too bad that all of these females are making Nesryn look so boring. Tbh, I would be the Nesryn if I lived in this book. She is like the only female without a powers or cool ancestry and she is probably going to end up with the Chaol, the nice guy in this series, he is still the original nice guy, just really misunderstood in these magical times. What the hell happened to Chaol?! This was a majorly shipped love interest, so his being paralyzed is not going well for this series. I just dont like that. The fact that this world has magic and healers makes me think hope that is paralyses will be short lived, and I hope this is one of the first things to happen in book 5. In all of this, I feel like I missed what Aedions special Fae thing was. He is at least half Fae and everyone Fae gets some super skill. Aelin gets to do fire and Dorian gets ice, Rowan shifts into an animal and so does Lysandra, what is Aedions magic like? He has to have something! Also, I totally ship Aedion and Lysandra. I thing they should both turn into cool animals and run off into the forest for a HEA. Dorian has some major things to sort out. He killed his father even though it was made clear that his father was being controlled by a Valg. Dorian is going to have some PTSD from all of this trauma. Maybe Manon and Dorain can sort it out together? Although with their damaged pasts together, this could go really badly. Obviously, I ship Dorian and Manon. Dorians kingdom needs a happy romance. Dorian might just be powerful enough to keep Manons temper in check. I think there is real interest there plus they have both been betrayed by their families. I just want them to be together and fill Adarlan with witchling babies. In Conclusion I dont care that everyone in these books keeps falling in and out of love. That is the nature of males and females working together. There are going to be alliances and there are going to be hookups. I am still going to root for some people to get a happy ever after. I am still most definitely a fan of this series. It just keeps getting better. I feel like this book has moved from being YA to NA due to the ages, actions, and mature language of the characters. I really enjoyed this installment in the series. I am excited about the next two books. If history has taught us anything, it is that the next two books will be massive and epic. I know some people will disagree due to the turns the series has taken, but I am going to give this 55 stars. This is a solid book with major conflicts, epic romances, and world building unlike anything out there in book land.
 spoiler alert  More reviews up on the blog Inside My Library Mind This book gets better and better with each reread. This is my third time reading this book, and Id like to point out somethings Ive realized. It just keeps getting better. When you know the plot and the overall story arc, that leaves a lot of room in your reading. What I mean by this is that since youre not engrossed in what is going on, you can focus more on the writing, and the character development and the overall craft of Maggie Stiefvater. And that is a glorious experience. On one hand, its spectacular to see how atmospheric and eerie Maggies writing style is. There are a lot of subtle ways that she uses to make her writing fit her setting rural Virgina and her story the search for dead Welsh kings. Just the way she writes exudes the magic she writes about. Maggies writing is hazy and melancholic, but it also feel really ancient and etheral. And thats the kind of story she is writing, thats the kind of magic her characters encounter. Thats something I really appreciated upon this reread. Also, since this is my third read, I can notice how much foreshadowing there actually is. I LOVE THAT. It speaks of the authors attention to detail and it speaks of the fact that they dont write their books in an offhand way unlike some people. Their story is already set in the first book. Things are already thought out. Theres no manipulation in later books. I just really love foreshadowing. It was especially obvious in the way Noah was written. Theres a tone of allusion to him being tied to the final scenes in The Raven King. Theres also a lot of mention of circles and circular time and storylines, which is basically what this series is. So it was really clever, and it was satisfying for me as a reader to experience. However, this kind of writing takes getting used to. Its different and so unique that it takes time for you to truly start appreciating it. This is why I think a lot of people dislike the series and I think that upon reread these books truly prove to be wonderful. But obviously, not everyone would want to reread the book until it starts to make sense, so that might be the series downfall. Its about the characters. One more thing that was really great to experience again is obviously the characters and their dynamic. You probably heard this a thousand times, but the characters are the strong point of these books. The plot is at best messy more on that in the reviews to come, but its not about the plot. Its about these characters and their relationships, so it was great to once again experience great character development and great character building. It is definitely the best I ever read. Few things that caught my attention this time around: Adams characterization is something marvelous. I stand by my initial statements  I strongly dislike Adam in the first two books. I understand him. Completely. I just dont like him. But the way Maggie writes his character is just superb. He is going through abuse and an awful homeliving situation. He is poor and he is struggling to make his own way in life. But the main characteristic Maggie always talks about in relation to Adam is wanting. He is constantly desperate with desire. Desire to be free. To be his own person. To have money and security. He is in a constant state of want. I love that. I also completely forgot how incredibly complex his relationship with Gansey is, the multiple layers of it as with any relationship in these books. That juxtaposition between adoring Gansey as his best friend, but also hating him for his money and family and looks and for just being Gansey. One of the reasons I strongly dislike Adam in this book is the way he acts towards Gansey. I get it, but I hate it and cant entirely justify it. Also theres a lot of little clues about Ronan and his life, and his dreams and Adam and I loved it. Also a lot of little clues about Blue and Gansey which was also really fun to experience once you know whats gonna happen. I also payed a lot more attention to the whole magic aspect of it. Cabeswater was so wonderfully written, and I never paid a lot of attention to that before. Its eerie and sentient and alive and I absolutely loved it this time around. So much of it is Ronan its ridiculous, but also amazing. All in all, I finally caved and rated this 5 stars. When I first read it, I gave it only 4, and then the second time I read it I left the 4 stars because I was too attached to the series and couldnt discern clearly from my feelings. However, this time around I can say that this is fully and truly BRILLIANT and deserves no less. August, 2017  THIS IS CLEARLY A FIVE STAR BOOK I dont why I resisted it reread in April, 2016: I dont know why I gave this book four stars WHEN ITS CLEARLY BRILLIANT, but I like to keep my original rating, since I trust it more. There is SO MUCH foreshadowing, its splendid. I can safely say that my eternal love for Ronan Lynch was confirmed, my awe for Gansey is deep and undying, I found new appreciation for Blue, Noah is adorable AND Adam is awful, but also awfully complex. On to the Dream Thieves. August, 2015: This was really interesting. Its a very characterdriven story, and I really enjoyed that. The plot wasnt that exciting to me, but honestly I didnt really care. I think these characters were amazing, very colorful and their chemistry... breath taking. I just wanted more of them interacting, more of their friendship. I just want more ok? Definitely recommend.
Before I start with this review, I have to apologize for something: this review will not address whether or not Eugenides is interphobic with his portrayal of an intersex protagonist. Its perhaps the most important factor in considering this book, to my knowledge the only novel with an intersex protagonist to gain mainstream success. But Im just not the right person to write about it. I wanted to, and I even did research in preparation for writing about this topic. But the more I researched, the more I realized that Im not very knowledgeable about what its like to be intersex and how intersex people wish to be portrayed. And that knowledge is essential to writing about whether this novel is interphobic. My review is incomplete because of this, but theres simply nothing I can do about that. I can only judge whether this novel is successful as a novel. If you want to know whether this novel is a good portrayal of intersex people, here are a few more qualified perspectives. So, does this work as a novel? Well... I hate to say it, but the short answer is probably no. I didnt exactly go in as an unbiased reader. Eugenides debut novel, The Virgin Suicides, was one of my alltime favorite novels, and it resonated with me on a personal level in a way that few other novels have. That makes it a tough act to follow for me. I probably wasnt going to like this book, personally, whether it was wellwritten or not. But even so, I do think that this is a seriously flawed book, beyond simply not being as good as The Virgin Suicides. Theres a lot of potential here, but the novel fails in execution. This novel is ostensibly the memoir of our protagonist, Cal, as he recounts his family history, and eventually his own childhood. For some reason, we see the lives of Cals grandparents and parents in a lot of detail, even though his relatives would never have told him this much about their lives. We get so much detail on their lives that it almost constitutes a separate story  it takes up the first 200 pages of this 400 page novel, and we essentially get their entire life stories. And for the life of me, I couldnt figure out why any of it was here. I understand why Eugenides felt the need to tell us that Cals grandparents were brother and sister  this was the source of the genetic disorder that made him intersex. But did that really require Eugenides to tell us the life stories of his grandparents and their kids? I might not have minded so much if these sections were interesting, or engaging, but they really werent. Eugenides adds enough flavor and intrigue into the stories to make them feel like more than just stereotypical stories of immigrants coming to America, but it was still incredibly boring. Part of this can be blamed on the fact that the characters in this section werent particularly welldeveloped. Each character tended to have one set personality trait superstitious, a strong work ethic, ect. that defined their entire character. This sections failure can also be blamed on the fact that the book was advertised as a story about an intersex person, and we spend the entire first half of the novel waiting for that story to begin, with the understanding that everything preceding it is less significant. Either way, the decision to include so much unnecessary detail is simply baffling to me. Eugenides has talked about wanting to write an epic story, resembling a Greek epic, in order to subvert the expectation that this novel would be about nothing more than the experience of being intersex. But this feels more like two novels stuffed into one  a modern epic, and a novel about being intersex. The format just doesnt work. But once the novel finally begins to focus on Cal, it gets better, right? Well, sort of. When Cal is a baby, his doctors bad eyesight prevents him from noticing Cals unusual genitalia, and the doctor assumes Cal is a girl with a typical vagina. So, his parents name him Calliope and raise him as a girl. The second half of the novel is about his upbringing in the wrong gender, as he realizes that theres something unusual about him, as well as the medical studies he was subject to after doctors found out he was intersex. Ill credit Eugenides for this: Cals story is a subtle one. Unlike the characters in the first half of this novel, Cal is extremely welldeveloped. Id say thats the novels biggest strength. The strongest and most memorable section of the novel focuses on the period right before Cal realizes hes intersex, when hes going through puberty and developing a crush on a classmate of his. Because this is ostensibly Cals memoir, he chooses to protect the identity of the girl he develops a crush on, simply referring to her as The Obscure Object. Taken in isolation, this section is an incredibly strong character piece, exploring forbidden love and the general feeling that one is different and out of place. The pacing is still slow, but this allows Eugenides to really flesh out Cal and the Obscure Object, with showing rather than telling. Its difficult to describe why this section works so well, but I will say this: its the only section that has the kind of realism and insight into human interaction that attracted me to The Virgin Suicides. From a writing perspective, Im so glad that Eugenides made Cal into a wellrendered character, rather than a cardboard cutout that only exists so that Eugenides can write about intersexuality. As I said above, Im hesitant to praise this novel from a social justice standpoint, but this is just a more successful novel on an aesthetic level because Cal is humanized. But then he and his doctors find out that hes intersex, and the novel goes downhill again. This doesnt happen until around five sixths of the way into the novel, and the whole final section  the one Id been waiting for since the beginning  just feels like too little, too late. The whole section is rushed. I never felt like we got much insight into how Cal felt during these sections, and none of the secondary characters were fleshed out very much. Its as if Eugenides just stopped caring, right at the most important part of the story. This novel doesnt come to a climax, so much as it peters out pitifully, with narrative summary and boring subplots. I dont want to spoil this section, but I will say that theres a ton of potential for this section to be incredibly fascinating, and it all feels wasted because Eugenides just doesnt have time to include it. He skims over sections in a couple sentences that couldve been expanded into entire chapters. This novel had tons and tons of potential. Eugenides prose is extremely wellcrafted, and hes telling an unusual story that needs badly to be told. But this is just boring. Eugenides has no sense of whats important and what isnt, and thats ultimately what kills this book. I dont know of any better books with intersex protagonists, and thats my own failing. But I cant imagine that this book is the best one out there. And if you wanted to read a Jeffrey Eugenides book, I would recommend The Virgin Suicides strongly over this. Cal has a condition known as 5alphareductase deficiency. From what I can tell, 5ARD is very hard to make generalizations about, and Im not super knowledgeable on it, so I deeply apologize for any mistakes. But this condition is a genetic mutation on the Ychromosone, and those with the condition can have a wide variety of types of genitalia. Cal has a micropenis, small enough to be mistaken for an unusually large clitoris at first glance, and otherwise outwardly appears to have a typical vulva. This review can also be found on my blog.
PUSHING THE LIMITS is an incredibly captivating, intense and emotional love story that brings together two characters who bear the scars of the tragedies theyve had to face and are still trying to overcome. Told from the alternating viewpoints of Echo Emerson and Noah Hutchins, this book allows readers to get to know both characters in depth through their own perceptions and from each others. It is a story that delivers realistic characters who have experienced tragedy and loss, who are forced to make difficult decisions and who must decide upon just how they want to let their burdens affect their present and their future. It is a story that is heartbreaking and beautiful. It is a story that is full of raw emotion. And it is a story that will leave its mark on those who read it. Echo is still in the dark about what happened to her to cause the disfiguring scars on her arms. Scars that changed her from the confident girl she once was to the introverted one she is now. If she could just regain her memories without risking her sanity, maybe shed be able to get her life back on track. Maybe she could find normal again. Noah lost everything the night of the fire. His family. His future. Himself. And while he cant return things to the way they were before, he is determined to do everything in his power to get his brothers back. If he could just find out where they are, maybe hed be able to put what remains of his family back together. And maybe, just maybe, he could remember what it means to be normal. Katie McGarry has created a heartwrenching love story that is beautiful and fragile, romantic and hopeful. She introduces two incredibly sympathetic characters who are damaged and distrusting and appear to be complete opposites, but who, when together, draw strength from one another. She adds tension and suspense to her story by keeping secret events from each characters past, revealing bits and pieces as the story progresses. And she makes the relationship between them one that isnt instant but with chemistry that is electric. Powerful, breathtaking and moving, PUSHING THE LIMITS lives up to its name. It tests the boundaries of love, trust and inner fortitude. It offers the promise that love may be worth the risk. And it gives readers a gripping, emotional rollercoaster of a story that is utterly unforgettable. On a personal note... I never intended to fall in love with PUSHING THE LIMITS. I only expected to like it. A lot. But I heard it was amazing. The buzz for this book and the anticipation for the next book in the authors series was insane. Which meant that I was wary. And even though I was excited to read it, I approached with caution. Well the buzz was not wrong. It was amazing. I loved this book. I read it in a day. And I loved it so much I read the novella and the next book in the series because I couldnt get enough of the authors writing and her characters. Which means that now I have to suffer the wait until November until I can read more about Isaiah and Rachel. This was such a beautiful story. It was also a tough story. I did cry. I did smile. I felt an incredible connection with the characters. I ached for them. I wanted more than anything for them to have as happy an ending as possible. I wanted their lives not to suck. While contemporary YA may not be my go to genre, when the stories are wellwritten and have depth of both plot and characters and where reallife issues are explored and emotions beyond those relatable to teens are a part of them, I can make that connection. And I made a really strong one with PUSHING THE LIMITS. I loved getting to know Echo, to learn why she was so damaged, to discover, as she did, just what happened to her. I loved seeing her begin to open up, to trust and to face her past. Her story was incredibly sympathetic but she wasnt pitiable. With all that shed had to deal with in her life, she was strong. She was damaged but not destroyed. And then there was Noah. I dont think he could have been more perfect. He had a little bit of the bad boy vibe going on, but he was a total knight in shining armor. Actually, I know he couldnt have been more perfect. If he was, I probably would have thought it a bit too unbelievable. He was the right amount of perfect. His past and present werent easy either. But he was honorable and amazing and heroic. Oh, and yes, for those readers that must know, hes hot. In books that switch POVs, I am almost always able to pick a favorite. Usually one is written a bit more detailed than another. Usually one character has a bit more depth, is more likable. And usually one gets more attention from the author. Not so in this book. Katie McGarry did a brilliant job of developing both characters, both points of views. Which means that Im not sure whose perspective I loved reading from more  Echos or Noahs. Because while I may love Noah a little bit more for what he did for Echo and for his brothers and friends, seeing him through her eyes, not just through his own, is what enabled me to see just how amazing he is. PUSHING THE LIMITS is one of those books that goes so far beyond being an engaging read. Even amazing doesnt quite seem an adequate word to describe it. As a reader I was invested in this story and in its characters. Their stories were ones I wanted to know more about. Their personalities were ones I found incredibly likable. And it was a book that took me all over the emotional map  happy, sad, anxious, heartbroken, hopeful. And it all started right from Echos very first words  My father is a control freak, I hate my stepmother, my brother is dead and my mother has...well...issues. How do you think Im doing? My original commentary: Amazing onesitread. Stayed up most of the night because I just couldnt put this down. Heartwarming, heartbreaking, beautiful. Review TK if I can manage to wrangle my thoughts.
Lucy, is all he can seem to say. Lucy. How am I going to walk away from tonight? Seriously. How? I get goosebumps. Im wondering the same thing. I let my head drop to one side, and we kiss. Im hoarse and breathless. Im gonna die tonight. Please take your pants off. I want that embroidered on a pillow. True story  earlier this week I reviewed the amazing Burn Down the Night by M. OKeefe and I said it was my favorite book so far in 2016. The very next book I read happened to be The Hating Game by debut author, Sally Thorne....and I have a new favorite book. Yes, two favorite books in a row, which never happens and Im kind of freaking out and I have that jittery feeling I get after reading excellent books maybe others get it from too much coffee. This book is so adorable, so romantic, funny, the best banter, amazing, gutwrenching sexual tension, I cant even deal with my life. Im not being dramatic at all! The premise  Lucy worked for a quaint, very bookishnerdy publishing house called Gamin, but they struggled financially. To save their business, they merged with the cold, serious, rigid publishing house called Bexley. The Bexleys are hard geometrics, the Gamins are soft scribbles. Lucy is the assistant to Gamins CEO and our hero, Josh, is the assistant to Bexleys CEO. When the companies merged, Lucy and Josh got placed inside the same office and from day one they have hated each other. Im never alone in here. Sitting opposite me is the executive assistant to Mr. Bexley. His henchman and manservant. The second thing, the most essential thing anyone needs to know about me, is this: I hate Joshua Templeman. Hes currently copying every move I make. Its the Mirror Game. To the casual observer it wouldnt be immediately obvious; hes as subtle as a shadow. But not to me. Each movement of mine is replicated on his side of the office on a slight time delay. I lift my chin from my palm and swivel to my desk, and smoothly he does the same. Im twentyeight years old and it seems Ive fallen through the cracks of heaven and hell and into purgatory. A kindergarten classroom. An asylum. I type my password: IHATEJOSHUA4EV. Josh is meticulously organized, has a temper, can kill people with the glares he gives them. He wears the same colored shirts on the same day of the week. He goes to the gym several times a day. He survives on mints. He isnt human, he never smiles, and Lucy cant stand him. Lucy is barely five feet tall and Josh is way over six feet  and their height differences makes her feel super short and she hates that. Put me down. This isnt funny. My feet make little ineffectual spirals. This isnt the first time a big kids thrown his weight around with me. Marcus DuShay in third grade once slung me onto the hood of the principals car and ran off laughing. The plight of the little humans. There is no dignity for us in this oversize world. Visit me up here for a sec. What on earth for? I try to slide down but he spans his hands on my waist and presses me against the wall. I squeeze his shoulders until I come to the informed conclusion that his body is extravagant muscle under these Clark Kent shirts. Holy shit. His collarbone is like a crowbar under my palms. I say the only idiotic thing I can think of. Muscles. Bones. Thanks. When a new position is opening up, one they both want, their hate takes on a new level, as they are going to have to compete for this job. Told all in Lucys point of view  the absolute best thing about this book is that you know right from the start that Josh is in love with her. That his surly, bitter attitude comes from being a bit shy and stubborn and not being able to admit his feelings. Instead he lashes out around her, because he is a big oaf and Lucy thinks he absolutely hates her. They play stupid games like The staring game where they face off glares at each other. They have to completely lock down their desk because they dont trust the other not to snoop when one walks away from their desk. She has never once seen him smile and it bugs the hell out of her. But then things start to change. Lucy has a rare date with a coworker and Josh loses it. Lucy gets ill, and Josh takes care of her for a weekend. Their dynamic shifts into possible and very fragile friends. A few things I have to point out: The banter in this book is absolutely adorable. It made me laugh out loud. When his bedroom door opens and he appears again, I am a mature young woman, legs elegantly crossed, flipping through a medical textbook, sipping my tea. Hes got on some soft black sweats, a black Tshirt, and nice bare feet. Cant he have a flaw? He sits on the edge of the couch, his hair damp and ruffled in every direction. I turn the page and unfortunately a lurid diagram of an erect penis glares up at me. I am trying to be a bit more normal. He looks at the page. Hows it working out so far? It made me smile so hard. It made me not want to put my kindle down and see what was happening on Twitter. Thats big, folks. The sexual tension in this book made me want to read faster and faster, yet I wanted to savor every word so I read slow. Whats with the weird eyes? Relax. I was thinking how big you are. I look at our joined hands. He carefully strokes the length of my palm with his thumb. When we look at each other again, his eyes are a little darker. Ill fit you just right. It hurt!!! It hurts because you know Josh is so freaking in love with Lucy, yet the author tortures you with this. And even after Lucy realizes what a hot, sexy beast Josh is and she jumps him at one point she literally hugs him like a koala and he walks around his apartment with her like this doing menial tasks Josh refuses to get nakey and give her hot sexin because he is afraid she will freak out afterwards. He takes things slooooow and I wanted to kill him and jump him myself. He catches my hand at the curb and walks across the street with me. When we reach my car, I tilt my mouth up to his. He carefully takes my face in his hands and he kisses me. A simultaneous shocked gasp rocks us. Its like we havent kissed in an eternity. He presses me against the car door and I whimper. Tongues, teeth, breath. You taste like my Easter egg. Please, please. I need you so badly. Ill see you at work tomorrow, he replies. He turns me in his arms, and presses his mouth against the back of my neck. The wait is worth it though  I wasnt sure if this book would go into the bedroom  but oh yes it does. The end is so, so romantic. The declaration of love is one of the best ever. It goes on and on and its so ridiculously romantic I just loved it. I think I highlighted three pages and wanted to paste them into the review  but that would kind of ruin the buildup of the book for you. This is the type of book that is filled with little things that will be caught on a second read through. Ive already started reading it again. I cant help myself. Little things Josh does  that Lucy doesnt catch onto but the reader will. Its a book full of games and competition. A glance from Lucy to a mirror in their office to see Josh can be so big in this book. There are so many little things that say, Oh  I see what you did there, author. I could listen to Lucy and Josh bicker and laugh and love each other day after day after day. Grade: A
HOLY EFFIN HOTTNESS BATMAN! That was a delightful surprise thats for DAMN SURE! Katy Evans writes this story and every single one of her words roll off every damn page screaming SEXY  SEX! This book took me to my knees like a perfect, epic, mindfuckingtastic RIPTIDE!!!! This was a REAL damn good! And the characters are so HELLA REALly, really awesome to get to know! Katy Evans gives the reader very in depth characters and pairs them with an ASS KICKING story plot, creating the BEST DAMN TIME you have EVER had reading a book! Brooke is the main female character, and, yeah I like Brooke. Yes, I was nervous at the beginning of the story, only because Brooke is shy and quiet. She had big dreams her whole life to earn an Olympic Gold Metal in sprinting. She worked her ass off training EVERYDAY, she didnt drink with friends in high school, didnt party, she had one goal: Gold Metal. She didnt know she spent more than half her life training to become the best that her body wouldnt allow. Brookes knee tore to hell wouldnt have it right when she thought her dreams were coming true. She could taste the gold, her knee however had other plans. So when we meet Brooke, she has long since been striped of her life long dreams, gone to college for sports medicine and graduated. But Brookes light was snuffed out the day her knee gave out. Spirit dimmed. Which brings me back to being nervous about her when I first met her in the story. I was worried she wouldnt be able to handle the RiiiiiiiiippppTiiiiiidddde that was coming for her and about throw her ass in a tailspin! When your main male character is a Fighter in the Underground fighting ring, Underground because he was so damn fierce and so much of a bad ass mother effer that he was kicked out of fighting in the Pros. When he has sex spilling out of his mouth EVERY time he speaks, sex spilling out of his pores with sweat, even his breath is sex. Im sorry, but if you have all that sexy fierceness wrapped into the male lead character, damn it Brooke you have to be one tough cookie not to crumble under the immense power of a man like that. Especially if he clocks your ass and claims you the first moment he lays eyes on you. Brooke girl you got to hold on tight as hell, or run for your dear life with a man like that! And our Brookey, she grabbed on like her damn life depended on it! And I was so freaking proud of her!!!!! YOU GO BROOKE! Grab Yo Man! Okie dokie then, now this is where Kimmi is going to get a little tiny bat crazy, because now we are going to talk about Remington Riptide Tate. Holy Shit I swear to the Gods I have NEVER wanted a male character to as real as I want Remi!!!!! Remi is possessive as hell, and so damn sexy, so damn HOT! sheesus, Kimmi is gonna call Remi Shoxy! His mere presence has his women fans orbiting around him like he is the fucking sun, and his men fans just either want to be near him, or be him. But he doesnt give a shit about the fame, the fans, he has one thing and one thing only in his sight, and thats Brooke. Hell tear through every man that steps inside the ring with him for her, he will spend any amount of money, and he will do it all, everything..... for her. He will have her, hell he already does, she just doesnt know it yet. But Brooke is scared and skittish, so hell move as slow as she needs. So, to lure her in he hires her as his sports medicine specialist. She will be with him on his fighting tour for the next few months. Gotta say here, Kimmi really wishes a Remi would swoop in and hire me for my nursing services, sigh but Im a labor unit nurse, soooooo yeah, no hot as hell underground fighter would be needing my services, or at least the services that lead up to finger lickin Remi Anywho, back to Real, sorry, totally got side tracked ;  This bomb ass story is one of a very few, that when you start it, you are like a crack fiend. You read that shit HARD  FAST! Then before you know it you glance down and realize you just tore though the first 50 of the book. At that point you freak out a bit, because you dont EVER want it to end! So you slow down, slow way down, never put it down, hell no. You loose sleep, meals, but you never put it down. You slowly savor it, word for word, you soak in every sentence, because when you hit 50 of this book you know that when you finish it, its over. And you KNOW you are not going to find another book that rips your breath away like this one for a looooong time. I wish I could go black and forget I read Real so that I can read it again. But I cant, so you know what I am going to do? Im going to do what I always do after I read a book of this off the charts caliber, Im going to fall into my book rut, and spend WAY over 300 on amazon Kindle scouring all these books, then start reading these books only to get 14 12 of the way through them and realize they are not REAL, the characters wont be Remi and Brooke, and then Ill quit these rut books, and then buy more rut books! All hell yall, here goes Kimmi. Into the biggest book hangover I have EVER had! Its probably going to be quiet on my end for a while : 
Red Queen was an incredibly fantastic and entertaining read, that definitely kept me enthralled with the story, the twist of plot, and the characters all the way through. THAT ENDING! I can say that Im absolutely pleased that I never truly saw it coming, because it made it that much more amazing. And yet, I had this constant little niggling in the back of my brain the whole entire time reading this book, that maybe just maybe...but, spoilers. Victoria Aveyard has truly managed to blow me away with the first installment of the Red Queen trilogy and I cant wait to see whats going to happen in the next book to come. No, I NEED TO KNOW NOW! I dont even now how to describe it properly, its like this really awesome mishmash of Red Rising by Pierce Brown and the XMen thats set in this castle where the Silvers train to do battle and fight in the war. The girls who have grown up in this environment and vying for their hand in marriage to one of these two Princes, are just as catty as some of the girls in The Meeting and Mean Girls are. Its just a brilliant concept all together and its wonderfully written and equal parts intriguing. Tie all of that together and throw in a lowly Red girl who is so much more than she or anyone else expected her to be and you have one hell of an amazing book on your hands. Mare Barrows has this amazing ability, that is most assuredly a mistake, but in her case it could turn out to be the thing that promises hope for her people. It could possibly be the thing that saves her life and so many more from perishing or being held down, slaves to the Silvers for the rest of their natural born years. Mares world is filled with insufferable amounts of pain, terror, and hopelessness. Victoria Aveyard does a marvelous job at showcasing that, allowing you to feel what its like to be so held down and kept under the thumb of the Silvers through Mares eyes. It will make you thankful for the simple freedoms that you have, once you see everything theyve had to endure from being conscripted into the war at an early age, from the loss of family and friends to the almost unbearable situations most Reds find themselves in. Mare isnt the type of girl who just falls in line and does what shes told like the good little girl. She is just as fiery and rebellious as she can be. She isnt afraid to stand up for her beliefs and she sacrifices so much of who she is for the people that she loves. Mare isnt without her faults though, she makes a lot of mistakes by trusting the wrong people, thinking that she can use them, without realizing that shes been used herself. Her selfpity wasnt something that I adored about her, but it was something that made her human and I can accept that much. For me, one of the best things about this book was the lack of a true love triangle, where she loses both her head and her heart to either one of the Princes. Thats not to say that Mare didnt somewhat show her heart or have these gut twisting feelings for one of them, because she did. She was just smart enough not to let it engulf her, she kept her wits about her and made sure that she did what she was there to do. For the most part, the romance and the actual plot of the story worked very well together and I was happy to see that what love story we were given didnt over step its boundaries. It was simply enough to satisfy and thats all it needs to be for right now. All of the characters in Red Queen, were fascinating as well as entertaining in my opinion. They all contributed wonderful things to the story in their own ways. Some of them a little more memorable than others, but each one uniquely interesting and crackling to life with their own flaws and abilities to either win you over or not. I love Cal, hes such an amazing character in such an impossible situation. He knows that change needs to come about, yet hes bound by his duties as the Prince and heir to his fathers crown one day, that he has to carry out orders as his father would. Yet, hes the one who saw to it that Mare wasnt conscripted, that she was given a job in the Castle. He liked her, was drawn to her because she saw something different in him, didnt recognize him as the Kings son. The sparks and the tension that ignited between both Cal and Mare was enough to put me on their team. Maven, on the other, he is a Prince of a different kind. He is a character that I found myself liking, despite the fact that everything inside of me was screaming that I shouldnt trust me as I was reading. I suppose I really shouldnt have been all that surprised with the ending of it, but I think theres still a part of me that wants to believe that hes not quite as evil as hes turned out to be. I want to believe that deep down inside of him, is the Prince that Mare believed there was good in. And yet, with that ending, I just dont even know. Kilorn. Hes so much akin to Jacob in the Twilight series, that I dont even know how to feel about him. I feel incredibly conflicted, because I felt all of these feelings for him all through out the book and yet, there at the end there was even more. Its almost maddening to me in a way, because as anyone can tell you Im pretty much not the biggest Jacob fan in the world. I loved him as Bellas best friend, but anything beyond was big fat NO for me. With Kilorn, theres just so much passion, incredible strength, and an immense streak of stubbornness that its almost insane. He gives me ALL THESE FEELINGS, more so than Cal and I cant decide what or who I want for Mare at the moment. What I think I want, overall, is for Mare to choose herself and her people. I want her to choose the path that she finds herself taking and I want to see the hope come alive for her people. I want to see her remain strong in her beliefs and do anything for that change she wants to see in her world, even if it means going to her grave for the cause. The wonderful element of betrayal and the misplaced trust in people that shouldnt have been necessarily trusted, was a big thing showcased throughout Red Queen and it brought about interesting surprises and revealed more lies and manipulation than I could have ever imagined. I was very pleasantly surprised as I sat reading the pages of this incredibly captivating book. There may have been a little bit of foreshadowing, but it wasnt enough that it bothered when I finally figured out one particular thing thats revealed at the end of the novel. For this to have been Victoria Aveyards debut YA novel, I have to say that Im definitely impressed with her writing style, the imaginings of her world, and such a vast array of entertaining and interesting characters. The action and suspense of this novel, left me clinging to the edge of my seat wanting so much more. Im operating on feels here guys and this book has ALL OF THEM! Note: I received an eGalley of this book for review via the publisher on Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.
The nittygritty: Hogwarts for assassins! A fantastic start to a new series by one of my favorite authors. Some of you may know Im a huge fan of Jay Kristoffs The Lotus War trilogy, and so it was with much excitement that I started reading his newest series. There are many similarities between the two, most notably Jays writing style, his penchant for drama and violence and quirky female protagonists, and even the inclusion of an animal sidekick. Honestly, even if his name hadnt been on the cover of Nevernight, I would have immediately guessed that Kristoff was the writer. But there are differences as well, and you can tell by my fivestar rating that I enjoyed these differences very much. Where Stormdancer was set in a fantastical feudal Japan, Nevernight takes place in a world that has strong Roman influences. Its an interesting mix of very formal speech and teenage slang that somehow just worked for me. Theres also humor in this book, which gave it a lighter feel than his first trilogy. Now dont get me wrong, theres plenty of heavy stuff going on hereassassination, revenge, imprisonment, torturebut its all tempered with lighter, funnier moments that give the reader a chance to breathe. Mia Corvere is a young girl who has had everything taken away from her. At age ten, she was forced to watch her father die on the gallows, hanged for treason, while her mother and baby brother were taken away and thrown into prison. Mia herself was nearly drowned by the same men who killed her father, but she managed to escape when a cat made of shadows rescued her. Ever since, shes been studying as a fledgling assassin with Mercurio, a man who understands her need for vengeance and has prepared her to join the Red Church, a secret school for assassins. Mia sets out to become an Acolyte in the church and joins other potential students, each with their own reasons for being there. But as classes begin, Mia realizes the road to becoming a fullfledged Blade, the highest honor given to an Acolyte, is fraught with danger at every turn. Not only are twentyplus students competing for only four Blade spots, but their teachers are trying to kill them. For in order to be a proper assassin, one must not only learn how to kill, but how to avoid death. Mia and her fellow Acolytes study in the Hall of Songs skill with blades, the Hall of Masks the secrets of seduction, the Hall of Pockets thievery and lock picking and the Hall of Truths poisons, and each day is more dangerous than the next. As their ranks begin to thin, only the most adept will earn one of the four top spots, and the competition is not only fierce, but deadly. Mia is so close to finally being able to avenge her family, but will she succeed? So what did I love about Nevernight? Well, lets start with the worldbuilding. Kristoff is no slouch at creating intricate worlds that completely immerse the reader, and this book is no exception. This time hes built a world ruled by three suns, which remain in the sky in various combinations some setting at different times than others for a full two and a half years before night falls and thats where the word nevernight comes in. Kristoff plays with the themes of light and dark throughout the book, not only with the suns, but with a group called the Luminatii, who not only worship the suns and curse the darkness, but are the very group of men responsible for Mias fathers death. Mia herself is a darkin, someone who is able to control the shadows around her, so in a sense, Kristoff has reversed the traditional meanings of light and dark, making the bad guys the followers of light, while Mia seeks the relief of the shadows. I loved this idea, especially when we learn more about Mias abilities as a darkin. There is a bit of a Harry Potter vibe to this story, in the sense that it reminded me of the classes and teachers at Hogwarts. Despite the seriousness of the Acolytes situation, there is a certain sense of wonder within the halls of the Red Church and in the streets of Mias home in Godsgrave, like the magical way the Acolytes travel from one place to another unseen, and the stunning abilities of a woman known as the Weaver, who is able to miraculously heal mortal wounds. As you can imagine, in a school for assassins, students acquire mortal wounds all the time... Which brings me to the footnotes. As we learn in the beginning, an unnamed narrator is telling us Mias story, and as the book progresses, he often stops to comment on certain worldbuilding elements in the form of footnotes. This was a clever way to get those elements across to the reader without resorting to info dumps although one could argue that footnotes are exactly thatinfo dumps!. But what I loved about them was that you can skip them if you want tothey dont seem to impact the actual story one way or another. However, I found myself reading them all the same, even though they did interrupt the flow a bit, but because I was so fascinated by this world, the footnotes added an extra layer and made the world that much more interesting. Also, our narrator has a wry and snarky humor that I loved, so not only were the footnotes interesting, but entertaining as well. I also have an inkling of who the narrator may be, but well just have to wait and see... For such a large cast of characters, I felt Kristoff did a great job at fleshing out their personalities. Mia has enough flaws that she doesnt come off as ridiculously perfect. Her nose is crooked and she doesnt seem to have much talent for fighting with blades. But her heart knows what it wants, and she never loses sight of the reason she came to Red Church. Then there is Tric, another acolyte who ends up being a romantic interest for Mia, a boy named Hush who never speaks, and a rather nasty girl named Jessamine who gets on Mias bad side right off the bat. Each of the adult characters has a distinct personality, and my favorites were a mysterious librarian named Chronicler Aelius who befriends Mia, and a teacher named Spiderkiller who teaches the acolytes about poisons. And I cant write this review without mentioning Mister Kindly, the shadow cat who follows Mia wherever she goes and drinks her fears and feeds on her nightmares. The further you read, the more you learn about Mia and her darkin nature, and when she discovers what she can do, its very cool! Its been pointed out by other reviewers that Kristoffs prose leans towards purple, and that his writing is at times overwrought and flowery. But although I did run across a phrase or two that was a little too out there for me for example: ...a burst of profanity so colorful you could fling it into the air and call it a rainbow., it wasnt enough to make a dent in my rating, obviously! So before this review becomes too long or has it reached that point already?, let me wrap things up by saying this: Nevernight is a fantastic start to a new series, with characters that will make you want to follow them to the next book, and the next. Thrilling, horrifying, bloody, dangerous, funny and intricately plotted, fans of Jay Kristoff will not be disappointed, and new readers will most likely run straight to the bookstore to check out his backlist. Big thanks to the publisher for supplying a review copy.  O gentlefriend, you knew I was going to add a footnote to this review, didnt you? In this case, I want to mention that this book has several very graphic sex scenes, and so Nevernight may not be appropriate for younger readers.This review originally appeared on Books, Bones  Buffy
Rating: 5 stars I JUST finished this and let me just take a breath hyperventilates OH MY GOD. I actually didnt think Id love this book so much. Simply cos I tend to stay away from all the hype. Not because Im trying to be hipster or whatever. But because I get so afraid of the book not meeting my super high expectations thanks to all the hype. This happened quite a few times to me. Which just RUINS the whole series for me cos I probably wouldve liked it if my expectations werent so high. BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. Ohhhhh, no. This book met my expectations and went far and beyond them. Okay, I suppose I should try and do a proper review by starting with a brief synopsis. Im afraid that otherwise this would just turn into a Love Rant about Peeta. The story is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lives in a dystopian world where the earth has exhausted all its resources and the land is divided into 12 different districts, each focusing on the production of a certain good. All of which is controlled by the Capitol. Every year the Hunger Games are held for everyone to watch. The Hunger Games is basically a morbid BattleRoyalecumWorldCup event where one boy and girl from each district are sent to the Capitol and then put into an arena where they have to kill each other off. The last one standing would be the victor and heshe and hisher entire district will be rewarded with food and other amenities that are sorely lacking in places outside of the Capitol. That is the gist of it. And Katniss has to choose between dying and killing. Dying would mean an honourable death and sort of flipping the finger at the Capitol who is manipulative and playing God with peoples lives. But killing and staying alive would be fueling the games and playing right into the Capitols hands. Also, things are made complicated with Peeta, the boy tribute from her district district 12, who is clearly in love with her and would protect her, even at the expense of his life. Would Katniss bear to kill him to be the victor? THIS BOOK IS PACKED WITH ACTION. And I dont mean just random fight scenes thrown in. I mean edgeofseat life or death situations and survival situations that the readers can only imagine in absolute horror. Its sort of Survivor the reality show meets Battle Royale. So there is tons of mind games that helps with the tension throughout the book. I was suspicious of everyone, even Rue. I was so sure she was gonna stab Katniss in the back, literally. But that flower scene broke my heart. Simply cos Katniss merged the identity of her younger sister, Prim with Rue her competitor and she ended up feeling as though she was fighting against her own sister. The pacing and writing is really spoton. I never felt that any scene was too draggy. Even when Katniss was starving or dehydrating. I thought it would be pretty boring but the way it is written, I was still rooting for her. Willing her to stay alive that I was kept engaged throughout the book. AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE TWISTS. HOLY CRAP. My heart literally skipped a beat each time a twist was introduced into the story and totally changed the course of where I thought the plot was heading. It was totally unpredictable and I was so confused and kinda scared of what might lay ahead. But that was whats SO GREAT about this book. Characters were ALSO great! I liked every one of them. Even the villains, even the Capitol, cos they were so morbid and strange. It was like reading of a new species altogether. Katniss was a great protagonist. She was strong, resourceful and hardened by life which means that she wasnt the usual whiny heroine we tend to read about in YA novels. Plus, shes totally badass with the bow  arrow. She can easily pass of as a Ninja and that is the highest compliment I can give ANY character. I do get abit annoyed with her as she seems a total devoid of emotion. And everything she does is calculated and done with a motive behind it. Even the funeral she staged for one of the tributes wont say who, though it was done out of respect. I felt that she just wanted to show the Capitol up. And her love scenes with Peeta. It was all... an act. Literally. Which BREAKS MY HEART cos I know how much Peeta loved her. Although I doubt she realizes how much she is relying on Peeta and sort of falling for him, she is all too aware of her relationship with Gale her childhood friend back home to let any of her feelings develop. It was like trampling on flower buds before they popped out of the ground. Such a waste. And Peeta. OH PEETA. Peeta, Peeta, Peeta... I am so in love with him. Its not even funny. I mean, yea, to be fair there wasnt enough airtime on Gale for me to feel for him. Although I do find him chivalrous and there is a something true about his partnership with Katniss and the way he looks out for her. But as awesome as I think Gale is, Peeta is just... amazing. Hes so gentle and awkward, thanks to the fact that he isnt nearly as badass as Gale and Katniss. But despite his shortcomings he tries his best to keep Katniss alive, even though there were times when I thought he had abandoned her. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DOUBTED HIM. Katniss kept emphasizing how good Peeta was at acting in love with her for the audience who were watching the hunger games. But we readers knew better. He wouldve done ANYTHING for her. ANYTHING. And my love for him just quadruples with each pages. Until finally my heart was wrenching in pain at the end of the book. I got really pissed off at Katniss. make up YOUR MIND WOMAN I felt so bad for Peeta cos I knew that the relationship was very onesided, but he pumped so much love into it that it was completely believable and sincere, looking almost whole. Okay, I should stop gushing about Peeta and mention other characters I enjoyed. I liked Cinna, Caesar, Cato and Clove. Dunno why they all happen to start with the letter C, thats strange. The only downside to this book is that I felt that the characterization wasnt thorough enough. I wanted to know more about the characters to make them less 2D. Even Peeta and Katniss, I felt like I needed to learn more about them. But I guess there will be more of that in the next 2 books in the trilogy. I also particularly enjoyed the flashbacks about Katnisss father and his connection with Mockingjays. This back story really allowed me to relate with Katniss more and made her character more likeable, as otherwise, I felt that she was kinda heartless at times. I was so relieved to see the softer side to her. Overall, this book is totally EPIC. Its the only word to describe it. It also left me breathless quite a few times and I had to stop reading for fear of what would happen next. That is usually a good thing and an indicator of the Thrill level this story has. Im glad that the hype on this series is not misguided and welldeserved. I am looking forward to the next two books as I wonder what is next after the Hunger Games are over. What would happen then? Gritty fastpaced writing laced with lovely characters and the constant foreshadowing of something darker, more dyer up ahead. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
You know that feeling, she said, when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing close around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage, and you cannot let go or turn the course aside. This was essentially how Tessa and I approached the last book in Cassandra Clares Infernal Devices series. If you follow my blog at all you know that I have a pathological dislike of love triangles. I think the third book is where they usually fall apart, and I was upset by another triangle series that recently concluded that I had previously adored. Because this series has the trickiest love situation I have ever seen, I was very wary about starting Clockwork Princess. Thankfully, I have thus far had tremendous faith in Clares writing. I know she plots her series mercilessly, so I was hopeful that she would give her characters the ending they deserve, and that while undoubtedly painful, it would also be satisfying. In the end, I believe she accomplished exactly that. Of course, Ms. Clare doesnt make anything easy for her readers. Going into the final book in this series, she had created an impressively complicated knot of love between Will, Jem and Tessa. Lets break it down. Beware of SPOILERS for the previous 2 books in the listing, skip to the paragraph below this section if you havent read them. Jem loves Tessa. Tessa loves Jem. Will also loves Tessa. Tessa loves Will too. Will and Jem are best friends and parabati. Jem and Tessa are engaged. Jem does not know that Will loves Tessa. Will does not know that Tessa loves him back. Jem does not know that Tessa loves Will. Jem is dying. There is no cure for his disease. Jem dying will destroy Will. Jem dying will destroy Tessa. Will is determined not to benefit from Jems death and will not be with Tessa when Jem is gone. I dont think the fact that Tessa and I thought that she was barreling towards an enormous precipice of tragedy is that unreasonable under the circumstances. However, for me, the more important point about this complicated love triangle, and what has set it apart from any triangle Ive read before, is the fact that it is a true threeway relationship. Will, Tessa and Jem all love each other. If one of them falls, they ALL loose something. Throughout this story, I was continually amazed at how strongly Clare was able to emotionally tie them all together  and me to them. Even more, none of them had absolute power over the others, which is the case in most triangles where the girl is the one holding all the cards and essentially has to pick which heart to break. Every decisionoutcome came with a sacrifice for all of them. Another part of this story that I loved, for itself and also for how it enhanced the love triangle, was the Victorian setting. Clare for the most part kept her characters mentally within the confines of that world. People living in Victorian England lived under a very different set of social rules than we do today, including a strict code of propriety and decorum. I think the historical time period helped me to focus on the high emotional content of the triangle, without suffering through some of the more annoying features of most love triangles i.e. a constant back and forth between the two guys. Dont get me wrong, there are some great kissing scenes throughout this series, involving both guys. But that wasnt the focus of this series, as much as how their love for one another impacted each individual relationship. I think the story worked better because of that. Although for me, the main focus of Clockwork Princess  at least emotionally  was the love triangle, that is in no way all that happens in this book. These characters face very stressful life and death situations outside of their own personal dramas, especially from Mortmain and his Infernal Devices. If youve read the first two books and want a reminder about whats going on when this one begins, click here: At the start of the book, Mortmain is still out there plotting evil things with his mechanical devices, Benedict Lightwood has demon pox, Jessamine is in prison, Charlotte is pregnant and her position is being threatened by the Clave because shes a woman who thinks for herself, Gideon has left his family home and is in love with Sophie the maid, Cecily has just shown up at the institute, and of course most importantly Jem is dying, and there is no cure.  Amazingly, Clare ties off all the loose end from the previous books including questions about Tessas origins, and answers new ones from this book. There are also lots of incredible secondary characters, who have their own relationship issues, all of whose stories I was highly invested in. One of my favorite parts of this book was seeing the small connections between this series and the Mortal Instruments. You arent missing anything if youve not read both series, but it was a fun addition to the plot. Clockwork Princess is Cassandra Clares strongest written book. The story took me longer than it should have to read, because I was focusing so much on her characters incredible words and thoughts. Clare has said that this series is a loose retelling of A Tale of Two Cities, and the way that Dickens story weaves into this one, was particularly moving. One thing that continues to impress me about this author is how well she knows the inside of her characters, and as a result how very complex they all are. But most of all I appreciate the grace she has shown to Tessa, Will and Jem. Although this book is incredibly heartbreaking at times, and each of the three carries burdens and faces impossible sacrifices, I felt like they all would be proud of their place in this story and in each others lives. Love Triangle Factor: HIGH all around  but I still loved this book! Cliffhanger Scale: Series conclusion. Loose ends are tied. No room for a sequel for these characters. A personal note: As much as I loved this book, I still dont really understand love triangles. Although I got caught up in Tessas world, and can completely understand how you can love multiple people in your lifetime, I rolled my eyes a few times at how much Tessa was equally in love with both guys at the same time. I truly wanted it to work out for all of them  which is a testament to how well Clare crafted her characters and their story, but I think my heart will always romantically choose one over the other. But that just explains how amazing this series is, because I still believe that this triangle was extremely well done and satisfying, and that you should read it.
Review posted on my blog, Becky on Books. A Very Scandalous Holiday is a fun collection of holidaythemed historical romances, with two British Regencyeraish stories acting as bookends for a World War II and 1920s era romance in between. There isnt a bad story in the bunch, but I definitely have favorites! Letters at Christmas by Amber Lin is the first story in the collection. Sidony Harbeck has to deal with the return of her former lover, Captain Hale Prescott. Three years earlier, he left to make his fortune at sea and she hasnt heard from him since. Now hes back, and determined to win her back. Shes just as determined not to let him, though.... This late Regency period romance was a sweet reunited loverssecond chance story. I enjoyed the characters and found their situation to be mostly believable, but it was pretty standard fare. A nice way to spend an hour or so, and I wouldnt mind rereading next year if the Christmashistorical mood strikes me, but it didnt stand out in any major waythough it did feature a cat as a secondary character, which is always fun. B rating. The second story blew me away, both for its unique twist on the traditional holiday story and its location and characters. Christa McHughs Eight Tiny Flames is set during the Battle of the Bulge, right at the edge of the action. Lieutenant Ruth Mencher is a nurse in the 64th Medical Evacuation Unit, and she has long been attracted to the units allbusiness doctor, Captain Joseph Klein. Ruth decides to take a chance, and on the second night of Hanukkah she shows up at his desk with coffee, potato chips, and the inexpensive menorah her family sent in their latest care package. Ruth wears a Star of David necklace each and every day, and is proud of her heritage. Joseph, on the other hand, learned while growing up in Texas that it was sometimes better to hide his faith away. In Naziinfested Europe, this seems doubly important. Hes unsure what to make of Ruths overtures at first, and fairly certain that getting involved with a nurse is a bad idea all around. As Hanukkah progresses, though, so does their relationship. I loved that this holiday story wasnt about Christmas, and I adored the WWII setting. Out of the four stories here, this one was definitely the most fleshedout; it had a very strong story arc and felt complete despite its short length. I will absolutely be reading more from this author in the future, and rereading this story again during the holidays. A solid A rating. I also really enjoyed the third story, Erins Gift by Nancy Fraser, as well. Its set during the Prohibition era, which again was unusual for a historical holiday romance. Erin OMara is a shop girl struggling to make it on her own in Chicagoher parents had died several years earlier, ending her dream of becoming a concert violinist. She still hangs out with two friends she made during her single year at the music academy, though, Abby Harrison and Will Packard, even though their social status is now worlds above hers. An illadvised trip to a speakeasy with Abby and Will ends Erin in jail, where Abbys older brother, Seth, a lawyer, bails them out. Representing her in court, Seth is taken with Erins quiet beauty, but he has no intention of falling in love again. A widower, hes decided that his young son Ben and his family are all he needs. But that was before Erin was fired from her job, and moves in to act as Bens nanny.... Erins Gift was a sweet little story, and I loved the characters of Erin, Seth, and Ben. The relationships between those three characters were nicely done. However, two things kept me from rating this one higher: one, Erin was at times too sweet. She really didnt seem to have any flaws save extreme innocence and a tendency to undervalue herself. Secondly, there really wasnt a strong story arc herea true climax except for that kind of climax. We had several of those here just never occurred. The biggest barrier between Erin and Seth was all in their heads, and quickly overcome. Absolutely everything comes fairly easily to these characters at the end. Still, it was a pleasant diversionand I loved Ben and Seth. B rating. The final story, An Enternity of You by Sophia Garrett, was set just after the Regency era in 1833. The new Duke of Sharrington, Andrew Wingate, is returning to his family estate after spending six years away caring for his earldom in Sussex and trying to forget the girl he left behind in Wiltshire. Now a widower, he brings his young daughter Alice with him, determined to make a new life for them both...and perhaps rekindle an old flame at the same timethough he fears it may be too late. As far as Rebecca Rycroft is concerned, too late is just the tip of the iceberg where Andrew Wingate is concerned. She once believed his promises of love and forever, but that was before he left her without a wordand carrying his child. Her six years of letters have gone unanswered, and her circumstancesand those of the town that depends on Andrews duchyare becoming worse every day. Her son Thomas is all she has left. Can Andrew possibly convince her to give them another chance? Or will it take a Christmas miracle? This story had some pretty heavy issues going onRebeccas situation as the novella opens is really pretty dire, and the town is clearly declining fast. Andrews dealing with major amounts of guilthe left the girl he loved years ago and married one he clearly didnt, and he ignored the fact that his father wasnt fit to govern the duchy on his own during his absence, even though he should have known better. The motivations given for his actions really dont paint him in a favorable light, and for much of the story I wasnt sure if I liked him all that much. It especially bothered me that he never opened any of the correspondence from the estate manager in all that time. At least the reason why Andrew wouldnt have known he had a childwhich admittedly was unfathomable to me at firstis explained in a fairly credible way eventually. The two children in the story steal the show, but in the end I felt like Andrew should do even more grovellingboth to the town and to Rebecca. I just wasnt convinced he deserved the HEA yet, though I was definitely rooting for Rebecca, Thomas, and Alice all the way. B rating. I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.
I know. We met less than a week ago and in that time Ive done nothing but lie and cheat and betray you. I know. But if you give me a chance...all I want is to protect you. To be near you. For as long as Im able. Wolf, are you asking me to be your alpha female? Alpha female, he murmured. I sort of like that. sigh Ill be your Alpha, Wolf. I so would. AH!!!!!! So fucking awesome!!! This was the perfect followup book to Cinder. I loved it more than Cinder. It was so intense and gory and fun and actionpacked. Amaaaaaaaazing!!! This is becoming one of my favorite series. I highly recommend it to everyone. Its a MUSTREAD. In Cinder, you follow the fairytale, Cinderella. We meet Prince Kai, Queen Levana, Cinder and many more characters. And though I loved that book, it wasnt as good as this one. In Scarlet, we follow the fairytale, Red Ridinghood. It was very similar in ways, but Meyer also adds her own story to the mixwith enough gore and intensity to keep you turning the pages until your eyes pop out of their sockets. I had so much fun with this book. Ill admit, I started listening to the audio and though I loved Rebecca Soler and how she narrated the story in Cinder and this one, I think I was finding myself a little too distracted. So I broke down and got the book and boy did I read it faster, not able to read fast enough for my liking. But at times she was slow, taking her time. Which is fine, but I liked going at my pace. So then, it picked up and I couldnt put this down. First of all, I gotta say...I love these covers. LOVE them. Like seriously. Theyre gorgeous and really fit the stories. So now, we have Wolf and Scarlet. Scarlets grandmother is missing, so Scarlet sets out to find her. But along the way, she finds out a lot about herself and where she came from. Wolf is a sexy, swoony, amazing, protective alpha. And damn did I love all the time we got with him. Sure, he was secretive about his part in the missing of Grandmere, but once he came clean, he was great. He did what he had to do to protect Scarlet. At times, I wanted to strangle her, and tell her to listen to Wolf. Okay, so how can you trust someone that lied to you? Well, hell Id listen to him regardless. It beats the alternative she had. He lied to protect her. He knew how dangerous his pack was and she didnt listen. But then again, she stopped at nothing to save her grandmother as most people probably would. But even when things turned out the way they did, I felt she should just trust him. And oh dear God. The gore in this is craaaazy. I dont mind blood and gore and violence. I love it. Its realistic and I watch it all the time in movies. Hell its even in real life. But I loved how Meyer was relentless with that part...she really made me feel like there were some real attacks going on. The wolves were fierce and mean and cruel. They didnt give a shit about morals or mercy. They just attacked and ate, like the feral dogs they are. Yikes! I still enjoyed it. I did even more because of all the bloodshed. Wow, that sounds sadistic. Oh well. I loved it. So when Scarlet finally trusts Wolf, I was all excited and giddy and rooting for these two. And when he asked her to be his alpha, I was screaming in joy. Those two were so cute. I could feel their tension burning up the pages. I could feel his wolf instincts kicking in and it was sweet. Love Wolf. Hes so...dreamy sigh Then we have Cinder and Kai. Yay! I was so happy Meyer included them still in this book. Cinder grew on me. I loved her chapters. I loved that she seemed to get a little stronger and more badass. But I felt bad for her because of what Kai is having to go through. Hes with the evil wenchQueen Levana. Shes relentless and wants to become the Empress to Kais Emperor. Yeah, Kai is the Emperor and she wants to marry him. But of course she has her own motives for that. And one that Cinder had warned Kai about in the first book. But he didnt listen. And now hes screwed. Stuck with this horrible witch. And shes brainwashing him to believe all that Cinder told him or pretended to be was a lie. But he realizes that theres no other way around this. If he doesnt marry Levana, there will be more bloodshed on his hands. He has to stop her from allowing the war to go onkilling innocent people when all she wants is Cinder. But Cinders missing, they cant find her. So what the hell is he to do? The next best thing, the other thing she wants. To marry her where shell become the ruler of the union and whatever. I would not wanna be in his position. However, I loved that Cinder and Scarlet are tied together. Both books were amazing. The writing, the characters, the worldbuilding, the action, the romance. I love it all. I just hope Cinder can get to Kai before he screws them all into the ground, before its too late. And I hope Wolf and Scarlet remain together in the next book and all is good with them. And they have a bunch of Wolf babies running around... Sorry, I got carried away there. So anyway, Im so glad I picked this one up. Im glad I stopped listening to the audio and got the book. I got a lot more out of it that way. I also loved Iko and Thorne as secondary characters. I couldnt help but compare Thorne to Kenji from Shatter Me. He was there for comic relief. His sarcasm and wit and charm was admirable and definitely needed for Cinder. But its what I loved about Kenji. I wonder if Im the only one that thought that? I still have that book on my mind, I guess. But I enjoyed the stories...interwoven with our beloved fairytales with great action and sweet romance. Such a fun journey. And I cant wait to get on with Cress. Im glad I gave this series a chance. I dont normally care to read about cyborgs and robots and stuff. But this one is just the right amount of awesomeness.
When you love someone, it seeps out of everything you do, it bleeds into everything you say, it becomes so everpresent, that eventually it becomes ordinary to hear, no matter how extraordinary it is to feel. God damn, this book is amazing. This story line is so interesting and its a crazy, passionate love triangle. Emma is married to Jesse, who she has known since high school. Theyve lived a wonderful, crazy life together full of travelling and passionate love and doing things they only ever dreamed about. She loves him with everything in her and vice versa. Then one day, on the day before their one year wedding anniversary, she gets a phone call saying hes been in a helicopter accident and has most likely died. Emma obviously grieves for years and doesnt want to live anymore let alone find love again with someone new. That is, until she meets Sam. Sam is a man shes also known since high school who always had a crush on her, but was always in the background. Sam is patient and kind and generous and he doesnt want to replace Jesse by any means, he just wants to be there for Emma, and they both fall in love. Then by a crazy turn of events, after she is engaged to Sam, Emma gets a phone call saying Jesse is alive and has been rescued and is coming home. Emma has a husband and a fiance. This is one of those bizarre scenarios that nobody ever could imagine finding themselves in, so it was very interesting to read about how this affected Emmas life. This book is a wonderful exploration of love and grief and how grief can change a person. I think its naive to think that people dont change after they deal with such an intense amount of grief and this book captures so perfectly how drastic a person can change over time. The writing style is beautiful and lyrical and it made me cry a few times. Im not going to lie, I wasnt a huge fan of the beginning of this story. You may have noticed I knocked off a star and heres why: the beginning of this book felt a little rushed. We meet Emma and Jesse right away, and shes crushing on him from afar. Then, before you know it they are together and we see the first scene when they meet and its cute. Then the next chapter jumps to the proposal, seven years later, and Im just like...? I dont know, I just really like to get to know the people Im reading about and see all the little moments leading up to them being together forever. I felt like I didnt get the chance to really connect with Emma and Jesse and appreciate their love before they were married. I understand why it was written this way, because those chapters were only meant as flashbacks and werent actually apart of the main story, but I would have appreciated more story on Emma and Jesses early relationship, thats all. The story did this again after she met Sam again and they had a great night out  then the next chapter skips to four months into their relationship, and then the next chapter skips to when they are moving in together. I dont know if Im nitpicking but the pacing of this story just kind of threw me off at times. I never knew when it was just gonna jump ahead by a few months or a few years. He smiles and its honestly just as striking as watching the sun shine through the clouds. There is no doubt though that this book is a new favorite of mine. I loved Jesse and Sam in their own ways. I loved that Jesse is so passionate and wants to experience the world with her. He fought every single day hoping to see her again and be with her and his love for her is so pure and genuine. Sam, however, is also head over heels for Emma and he always has been. He cares for her enough to let her explore if she still has feelings for Jesse, and that says a lot about him as a person, and about how confident he is in him and Emmas relationship. Sam is one of the sweetest, most caring male characters Ive ever read about, and I absolutely adore him. He only wants the best for Emma all the time and hes so selfless and its really admirable the way he loves her. I think its a good sign though, he said, that I was crazy about you at sixteen and Im still crazy about you now. I loved every moment while reading this book. It was such a heartbreaking, but beautiful journey seeing Emma go through discovering the loves of her life. I am a strong believer in the idea that there is no one love in your life. I believe that different people can be your soul mates at different times in your life. And just because you move on and grow apart doesnt mean that your love with them wasnt real and true. This book captures that idea so well, and I struggled alongside Emma going back and forth between Jesse and Sam  because you can tell how amazing of men they both are, and they are both extremely passionate and loving towards her. Those scenes in Maine kind of broke my heart when Jesse was telling her he got her diet coke and pizza and she didnt know how to tell him she doesnt drink diet coke anymore, and she doesnt like cheese anymore, and she changed her last name back to Blair and started playing the piano. She is a completely different person than who she used to be and Jesse has no idea how to love who she is now and its sad but its so realistic. Sam knows exactly who she is and he loves her for exactly who she is and their love story is so inspiring. The last page made me cry when Jesse said: You and I arent going to spend our lives together. But I finally understand that that doesnt take away any of the beauty of the fact that we were right for each other once. Its so sad and heart breaking for them to come to the realization that they grew apart. Then it ends with: I am who I am today because I loved you once. and that shit broke me. I think its very powerful that people can change due to love and grief. This book ended on a beautiful note and it gave me all the feels. I adore this story so much, and my heart feels like it has been on an emotional roller coaster after finishing this. I adore both Jesse and Sam. The only reason I knocked off a star is because the pacing felt a little random at times and I didnt like the time jumps, I would have liked just a little more flashback scenes of Emma and Jesse before they were married so I could really get attached to their romance before Jesse disappeared, but other than that, I really loved this book. This was my first time reading a book by Taylor Jenkins Reid and it certainly wont be my last. If youre a fan of new adult romance  and love triangles that are written beautifully then I would definitely recommend reading this one.
Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales Quick  Dirty: Wow, Snow Like Ashes was a fantastic debut with amazing characters, plot twists, and romance. Opening Sentence: Block! The Review: Miera is one of the last of Winters refugees. In a world where 4 kingdoms exist with never ending seasons, she is from the one where the people were killed or forced to work in camps as slaves. She and the others mission: free the Winterions, let them flourish again. But it wont be easy. Spring has an evil, powerful ruler who has much magic. Plus, Miera is falling for someone she can never be with, so her problems arent easily dealt with. Their only chance might not be enough, at this point. And there isnt anyone left to save Winter if they fail. Oh my god, Snow like Ashes. This ones a winner, fellow readers, trust me. Where do I begin? The fantastic world building and kingdom? Okay, Ill start there. Basically the whole concept of the four season kingdoms was exciting and original. I had so much fun conjuring up pictures in my head, especially of Winter: chilly, beautiful, covered in a cool blanket of snow and the clouds sending gentle flakes down to earth. I have always considered winter as cold, and though associated with skiing and hot chocolate, never as beautiful as the elusive, bright colors of fall or the scent of rain and budding newness of spring. This book changed the connotation of the word winter for me. It was that freaking good. Not to mention that each Season kingdom had different types of people, the Winterians with white hair and stunning blue eyes, the Springs with light brown skin and green eyes. The Falls had nutmeg skin and curly dark hair, and the Summers had golden locks paired with bright green eyes, as well as a good tan. It was a lot of fun conjuring the pictures in my mind, I can tell you that. In the first chapter shes looking at Mather and commenting on how attractive his white hair is, and at first I thought Wait, what? When I realized all of the refugees had that color hair I was struck by a very oh! moment. This book likes to toy with your emotions. It likes to tackle you with feels. Miera is always thinking about the kingdom, what has been lost, trying to reassure herself and her companions that it can be rebuilt. At one point, the character is trapped in a Winterian work camp, and oh my. Her very realistic struggle with hope and giving in was so sad to see. Speaking of the main character, I loved her. She was kicking ass the whole way through and I enjoyed her commentary and banter with fellow characters. She wasnt too perfect, however; she had many doubts and sometimes succumbed to selfishness, but she was never horribly whiny. I hate whiny characters with a passion, let me tell you that. Miera always saw a tiny bit of positive in everything too balance out any crushing depression or trapped feelings that might be going along with it. The love triangle was also very complicated. I kept going back and forth between my favorite of the guys. I have to say, Mather grew on me. At first he was a little annoying and never seemed like a good choice, but eventually I started to like him. Anyone who reads my reviews knows that a good or bad romance can make or break a story for me, and luckily enough this made Snow Like Ashes. Along with my love of the main character and setting, my interest just grew at the point when the love triangle became more intense. Snow Like Ashes may become one of my favorite series, if the next books play out as well for me. It was atmostpheric, exciting, filled with action and humor and conflict and romance and friendship and themes and oh, how I enjoyed Snow Like Ashes. I had high hopes as all the high reviews rolled in and luckily enough they were correct. The ending was full of surprises, plot twists, and I was so happy with the development in Miera. Shes grown stronger and more aware of her values and beliefs over the course of the book and overall was just a great point of view. If there were any problems in this book, than they didnt stick out to me. This is also an awfully long book as well, which is great, because I swallowed it up! Lots and lots of stuff was stuffed into the pages but the pacing seemed fine to me. One thing Im interested in knowing the answer to is this: what happens when someone of different kingdoms have children? Like a Winter and a Fall, with their opposite hair and body tones, what would happen then? We know different seasons have had children before. For some reason this question really pulls me in, and I hope its addressed in the next book. Notable Scene: I aim my chakram at the captain, the one with his boots mucked up with sewer gunk. His eyes swim over me. The Winterians are sending girls to do their dirty work now? he sneers. Why dont you put that thing down before someone gets hurt? I push out my bottom lip and widen my eyes. This? I lower the chakram. Its now aimed at the captains left thigh. They gave it to me and said throw! I dont even know how it works The soldiers jeer, a deepthroated chuckle that says this is a fight theyre sure theyll win. I let the chakram fly as the captain moves forward, my body bending into an arch. The chakram soars through the sewer, slices clean through the captains leg, and continues its spin back to me in one elegant circle of purpose. He screams and drops into the sewage, grabbing his thigh like, well, like I just sliced through it. Oh. I run one hand down the flat side of the blade. Thats how it works.

Red Queen was an incredibly fantastic and entertaining read, that definitely kept me enthralled with the story, the twist of plot, and the characters all the way through. THAT ENDING! I can say that Im absolutely pleased that I never truly saw it coming, because it made it that much more amazing. And yet, I had this constant little niggling in the back of my brain the whole entire time reading this book, that maybe just maybe...but, spoilers. Victoria Aveyard has truly managed to blow me away with the first installment of the Red Queen trilogy and I cant wait to see whats going to happen in the next book to come. No, I NEED TO KNOW NOW! I dont even now how to describe it properly, its like this really awesome mishmash of Red Rising by Pierce Brown and the XMen thats set in this castle where the Silvers train to do battle and fight in the war. The girls who have grown up in this environment and vying for their hand in marriage to one of these two Princes, are just as catty as some of the girls in The Meeting and Mean Girls are. Its just a brilliant concept all together and its wonderfully written and equal parts intriguing. Tie all of that together and throw in a lowly Red girl who is so much more than she or anyone else expected her to be and you have one hell of an amazing book on your hands. Mare Barrows has this amazing ability, that is most assuredly a mistake, but in her case it could turn out to be the thing that promises hope for her people. It could possibly be the thing that saves her life and so many more from perishing or being held down, slaves to the Silvers for the rest of their natural born years. Mares world is filled with insufferable amounts of pain, terror, and hopelessness. Victoria Aveyard does a marvelous job at showcasing that, allowing you to feel what its like to be so held down and kept under the thumb of the Silvers through Mares eyes. It will make you thankful for the simple freedoms that you have, once you see everything theyve had to endure from being conscripted into the war at an early age, from the loss of family and friends to the almost unbearable situations most Reds find themselves in. Mare isnt the type of girl who just falls in line and does what shes told like the good little girl. She is just as fiery and rebellious as she can be. She isnt afraid to stand up for her beliefs and she sacrifices so much of who she is for the people that she loves. Mare isnt without her faults though, she makes a lot of mistakes by trusting the wrong people, thinking that she can use them, without realizing that shes been used herself. Her selfpity wasnt something that I adored about her, but it was something that made her human and I can accept that much. For me, one of the best things about this book was the lack of a true love triangle, where she loses both her head and her heart to either one of the Princes. Thats not to say that Mare didnt somewhat show her heart or have these gut twisting feelings for one of them, because she did. She was just smart enough not to let it engulf her, she kept her wits about her and made sure that she did what she was there to do. For the most part, the romance and the actual plot of the story worked very well together and I was happy to see that what love story we were given didnt over step its boundaries. It was simply enough to satisfy and thats all it needs to be for right now. All of the characters in Red Queen, were fascinating as well as entertaining in my opinion. They all contributed wonderful things to the story in their own ways. Some of them a little more memorable than others, but each one uniquely interesting and crackling to life with their own flaws and abilities to either win you over or not. I love Cal, hes such an amazing character in such an impossible situation. He knows that change needs to come about, yet hes bound by his duties as the Prince and heir to his fathers crown one day, that he has to carry out orders as his father would. Yet, hes the one who saw to it that Mare wasnt conscripted, that she was given a job in the Castle. He liked her, was drawn to her because she saw something different in him, didnt recognize him as the Kings son. The sparks and the tension that ignited between both Cal and Mare was enough to put me on their team. Maven, on the other, he is a Prince of a different kind. He is a character that I found myself liking, despite the fact that everything inside of me was screaming that I shouldnt trust me as I was reading. I suppose I really shouldnt have been all that surprised with the ending of it, but I think theres still a part of me that wants to believe that hes not quite as evil as hes turned out to be. I want to believe that deep down inside of him, is the Prince that Mare believed there was good in. And yet, with that ending, I just dont even know. Kilorn. Hes so much akin to Jacob in the Twilight series, that I dont even know how to feel about him. I feel incredibly conflicted, because I felt all of these feelings for him all through out the book and yet, there at the end there was even more. Its almost maddening to me in a way, because as anyone can tell you Im pretty much not the biggest Jacob fan in the world. I loved him as Bellas best friend, but anything beyond was big fat NO for me. With Kilorn, theres just so much passion, incredible strength, and an immense streak of stubbornness that its almost insane. He gives me ALL THESE FEELINGS, more so than Cal and I cant decide what or who I want for Mare at the moment. What I think I want, overall, is for Mare to choose herself and her people. I want her to choose the path that she finds herself taking and I want to see the hope come alive for her people. I want to see her remain strong in her beliefs and do anything for that change she wants to see in her world, even if it means going to her grave for the cause. The wonderful element of betrayal and the misplaced trust in people that shouldnt have been necessarily trusted, was a big thing showcased throughout Red Queen and it brought about interesting surprises and revealed more lies and manipulation than I could have ever imagined. I was very pleasantly surprised as I sat reading the pages of this incredibly captivating book. There may have been a little bit of foreshadowing, but it wasnt enough that it bothered when I finally figured out one particular thing thats revealed at the end of the novel. For this to have been Victoria Aveyards debut YA novel, I have to say that Im definitely impressed with her writing style, the imaginings of her world, and such a vast array of entertaining and interesting characters. The action and suspense of this novel, left me clinging to the edge of my seat wanting so much more. Im operating on feels here guys and this book has ALL OF THEM! Note: I received an eGalley of this book for review via the publisher on Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.
The 5th Wave was a pleasant surprise for me, although having read Rick Yanceys The Monstrumologist, I knew that I really enjoyed his writing style. Were here, and then were gone, and its not about the time were here, but what we do with the time. The premise behind The 5th Wave is pretty much an alien invasion, and the aliens are winning. Theyre taking earth, and there really isnt anything we humans can do to stop them. Are the concepts in this novel unique and original? No. Theyve been told in other science fiction novels and shows, and probably told better. However, the world that Rick Yancey created with these borrowed concepts, was awesome and just kept me entertained, and because of that, 4 Stars baby! The book follows several characters, including our main heroine Cassiopeia Cassie Sullivan. Shes a 17 year old living in a world with one rule for her: to trust no one. Because, in this crazy, alien invading world, shes lost her family in devastating ways. Yet, she attempts to overcome and stay strong, namely to keep a promise to her little brother, six year old Sammy. Shes snarky and brave, and for the most part independent, and for the most part, I loved her. And then, she was whiny and made a crap ton of mistakes that made me want to pop her across the face. Oh, to be young again. Another character were introduced to is Evan Walker, Cassies hopefully only love interest in this series, but well see. Hes an alien, and hes human. Hes a Silencer meant to take out humans during the 4th Wave of the invasion, but when he comes across Cassies path, he just cant do it. She brings back the humanity side of him, and he stalks her. Am I OK with the stalking love interest? Usually no, but I think I just liked Evan so much, Ive made an exception for him in my mind. I enjoyed their interactions together, and although Cassies trust in him was shaky, for valid reasons, I think their friendship and love grew OK in this. It definitely was instalove, on Evans part, and Cassie was the more hardheaded one, in denial until the end. Still, I liked it. Again, normally intalove pisses me off, but Evan was just one of those characters I was rooting for. Another viewpoint we meet, is Cassies infatuation from high school, Ben Parish aka Zombie. He is rescued by the government after contracting the plague in the third wave. They nurse him back to health and train him to be a soldier, to fight in an upcoming battle where humans will try to take back Earth and put a stop to the aliens. And boy does that sound great to Zombie! He had lost his family during the invasion, and because he ran away during the fight that killed his family, he feels the need to prove himself...of course, he learns so much more about himself and about the government, and the plot thickens a lot... The final view we see is Sammys. Hes also taken in by the government, and he is also being trained to take out the aliens in the upcoming war. Reminder  kid is six years old! Sammy is put into Zombies training squad, and Sammy definitely latches onto Zombie as a substitute for Cassie. He needs the love and support from a sibling, and Zombie is there. Zombie also needs a little bit of something to believe in and love again, and he sees Sammy as a doover for his guilt and mistakes. The characters come together when Zombie learns the truth about what is going on, and Evan opens up to Cassie and reveals the truth as well. Together, Evan and Cassie make it their mission to rescue Sammy, and Zombie also wants to rescue Sammy away from the government. They meet up at the Haven in a very awkward way, but hey, you have to do what you have to do. There are minor characters from Zombies squad that help with the rescue, and I loved how the squad interacted with each other. Definitely looking forward to seeing where this series goes. The spoilers are just some that came to mind, dont open it if you dont want to read any. They may not even make all that much sense...its just things I had to get out and vent about a bit... Evan had better NOT be dead. Im really hoping he got out before destroying the Haven central base that the aliens were using on Earth. Serious fingers crossed on that. Also with the kiss that Zombie gave Cassie on the cheek at the end, Im really hoping that doesnt turn into anything more. I mean, he kind of has Ringer, or it seemed like he does, and Cassie has Evan. That and Ben Parish didnt even KNOW Cassie, even though they went to the same school. Just no love triangle, please...for fuck sakes no love triangle... All in all, Im thrilled that Ive read The 5th Wave , and Im absolutely looking forward to the followup novel, The Infinite Sea coming out this year. I believe this will be a trilogy, so one other book will be out as well, so, definitely looking forward to that as long as The Infinite Sea is awesome!
The Werewolf of Paris is an interesting book. Part horror story and part historical fiction, it follows the travails of the titular werewolf of Paris from his birth to his death, as well as his place in the blooddrenched moment of history known as the FrancoPrussian War that was followed by the illfated Paris Commune. Interestingly the werewolf in question, Bertrand Caillet, is actually something of a secondary character in his own tale, as it is told from the perspective of his adoptive father Aymar Galliez. We never see the wolf itself in action, and despite some tantalizing clues built upon separate pieces of evidence, the actual lycanthropy of Bertrand could as easily be interpreted as a purely psychological affliction as opposed to a supernatural one. Add to that the fact that we are being told this tale thirdhand Endores conceit being that his story is being constructed from the reports and reminiscences of Galliez who had to put the pieces together mostly secondhand, interspersed with Endores own researches into the documents of the period and the truth or fiction of the lyncanthropy in question becomes even greater. Sometimes this conceit does not always benefit Endores story, for there are many scenes and events that occur within the text that would have been clearly outside of the knowledge of Galliez or any documentary sources of the day...still that is a quibble for something that really is a novel and quite an enjoyable one at that. Endore starts his documentary with a tale taken from the annals of history that purports to enlighten us as to the ultimate origins of our werewolf. It is a sordid tale of feuding nobility wherein the Pitamonts and Pitavals, after having waged generations of warfare against each other, finally end their feud in mutual impoverishment and one of the last of the Pitamonts is held captive for years by the last of the Pitavals. His imprisonment is an inhuman one, and he is left to suffer in a literal hole in the ground, fed nothing save raw meat. This apparently triggers his transformation into the wolfman of legend. Our tale truly begins, however, when Josephine, a young peasant girl newly arrived in Paris, is raped by a priest, a descendant of the last of the Pitamonts, and bears Bertrand, a child destined to bring forth the family curse. We follow Bertrand in his young life, at first so full of promise and then slowly brought to near ruin by his everincreasing taste for blood. Strange things begin to happen in Bertrands village: animals go missing or turn up dead, recent corpses are found exhumed and partially eaten. What could be happening? Slowly Bertrands uncle Aymar the nephew of the woman who had taken in Josephine and the man who ends up becoming responsible for both mother and child begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together and see that everything leads back to his nephew. At first he tries to slake the thirst of the monster inside Bertrand by feeding the boy raw meat and keeping him confined to the house. This only has limited efficacy and soon more drastic measures need to be taken. Ultimately the boy is able to escape his wellmeant prison and, starving to appease his lusts, goes on a spree of murder and terror that takes him to Paris. Here, amidst the confusion of the end of the FrancoPrussian war and the rise of the Commune Bertrand is able to satisfy most of his hungers free from persecution or discovery. But his Uncle Aymar is spurred on by regret and remorse. He feels responsible for the release of this beast upon the world, a beast he is convinced is a supernatural terror, and decides to hunt him down. The rest of the tale details his attempts to find Bertrand and his slowly dawning discovery amidst the chaos and death that seems to permanently reside in Paris that perhaps mankind itself is the true monster. Side by side with this runs the parallel story of Bertrand and his fortuitous discovery of a lover not only able, but willing to supply him with a conduit for the slaking of his varied lusts...it is an interesting picture of depravity, lust and mutual codependence. Of course things come to a head and the piper must be paid. Endores overarching purpose is, I think, not really to tell a werewolf story, but a desire to expose the bloodthirsty nature of mankind, for which the werewolf of the title becomes little more than a symbol, or even a contrast to this thesis, since one lone werewolf, no matter how savage, can never hope to decimate the lives of which plain old human conflict is capable. For, as even Aymar the unstinting hunter of the wolf must admit, if the hands of normal men are able to commit and rationalize the coldblooded killing of 20,000 commoners as part of the reaction against the Commune not to mention those killed by the Commune itself in its heyday, or the casualties of the FrancoPrussian war before it then What was a werewolf who had killed a couple of prostitutes, who had dug up a few corpses...? Endore, and by extension Aymar, even postulates that the very existence of the werewolf may have been nothing more than the sickness of the time manifesting itself physically...though it is left openended in a chickenandegg way whether it is the madness of the time that allowed the wolf to be born, or whether it was the existence of the wolf that could infect mankind with its madness and bloodlust. Overall this was a good tale, though I would say it came across much more as historical fiction for me than as pure horror which in my opinion is fine. It has also been claimed that this is the Dracula for Werewolves and Im not sure if I agree. Certainly it shares similarities with Dracula in its documentary format and is a wellwritten, and even seminal, version of the werewolf myth, but I am not widely enough read in werewolf stories to say whether or not it is the best of them. Also, the ambiguity of the actual reality of Bertrands lyncanthropy and his relatively secondary role as a character in the story makes me think that while this is a good tale well worth reading, it may not be the ultimate exemplar of werewolf fiction.
MaryAnns Review: This book, this book, this book! I loved this book so much. From the very first few pages to the very end, I was swept up in the amazing world and story created by Renee Ahdieh. It was impossible not to fall in love with all the characters, especially the monster boyking Khalid. Main character, Shahrzad, has a plan. She will do what it takes to avenge the murder of her best friend Shiva. A death that was carried out by the king, Khalid. In order to follow through, she volunteers herself as the next queen and face Khalid and hope that she survives past dawn. With her mesmerizing storytelling ability, Shahrzad has not only bought herself more dawns and time, but she seems to have captured the attention and heart of Khalid. When Shahrzad sees Khalid in a different light than that of which she has only known, her interest in Khalid grows, which not only surprises her, but surprises also the king and those around them. But the new life that Shahrzad is creating for herself is one that her past relationships will not understand. As Shahrzad gets closer to Khalid, Tariq a man who Shahrzad has been in love with since she was 12 and hasbeen good friends with sets out to rescue his love, and to kill the monster boyking. A king who kills a different wife every day, and whom he fears will kill his beloved Shahrzad. With an old love coming to save her from a life that she doesnt want to leave, and a king who has a secret so dark that the truth may only seal his fate, Shahrzads loyalties are tested, and what she finds is something she did not expect to find. I just have to say it again. I loved this book so much! What I loved the most was the way the author brought forth so many different emotions in me. For example, in the beginning, the reader is taught to believe in one side of Khald, Caliph of Khorasan, the King of Kings, the monster boyking. The unforgiving, brutal, savage beast that is known to kill an innocent woman every night with no remorse and no regrets. That no woman is safe and that all should live in fear. But as we progress through the book, the truths that Shahrzad learns are ones that of course the reader learns too. Shahrzads eyes are opened, as were mine! She slowly fell, and so did I. I came to adore Khalid and felt so much pain and sorrow for him. To have lived through what he has had to live through, to have so much burden on his shoulders and knowing that the only way to make things right is to do something that he does not want to do. I also fell in love with his words, and the way he speaks to Shahrzad. It showed us the softer side of Khalid that you cant help but adore. He is sweet and tender, and conflicted and trying to be a better man...for her. His Queen... his joonam. And for those of you looking for a headstrong female lead, then Shahrzad is the one for you! She will not rollover and give up. She fights for what she wants, successfully might I add. She is smart and calculating, and is no dummy. She sees whats before her and understands what needs to be done, and still she continues to be strong and unafraid. I thoroughly enjoyed her character too! Not only were the main characters an amazing pairing, but the other characters in the book were just as memorable. They all clicked together, like a good movie pairing should. In fact, what would I not give to see this book become a movie! If it played out exactly how I pictured it in my mind as I was reading, then it will definitely be an epic film. The writing style of author, Renee Ahdieh, was flawless and flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter. The interactions between the characters were realistic in feeling and is what made the book for me. I also enjoyed the story within a story feel in the beginning when Shahrzad had to weave her tales to save her life. I recommend this book to readers that are looking for something that will carry them away to a world that is unforgettable, and to find characters that I dare you not to love. Gabbys Review: If youve heard of the Arabian Nights or A Thousand and One Nights then you already know the premise of author Renee Ahdeihs The Wrath  The Dawn. If you havent heard of the Arabian Nights, then simply imagine this: a kingdom ruled by a king who marries a new girl each day only to murder her the following dawn. Shahrzad, is the next girl meant to wed him but unlike the others, Shazi has a plan meant to ensure her survival and the kings downfall. If that doesnt already intrigue you then I dont know what will. Ahdeihs The Wrath  The Dawn is a novel that grips you right from the very beginning and never lets you go. After the murder of her best friend at the Caliph of Khorasans hand, Shahrzad creates an elaborate plan that will ensure her vengeance. Agreeing to wed the Caliph next, Shahrzad survives through telling him stories and barely finishing them as dawn arrives, allowing herself a new day to survive. While disorder brews within the Khorasan and the people closest to Shazi plot a way to return her home, she finds herself growing unwillingly closer to the CaliphKhalid: a man who first appears to be a monster has the potential to be something else entirely. There are bits of humanity beneath his calloused exterior and as Shazi delves deeper into the mystery behind the murders at dawn, the more she finds herself falling for her husband, the Caliph, and questioning her own sinister intentions. Immediately its Ahdeihs writing that grips readers and never lets them go. Her prose is fluid and elegant. Each word exquisitely chosen and pulling the story forward. Every detail is beautifully described and leaves everything and nothing to the imagination. The Wrath  The Dawn is a wellwritten, lyrical story that leaves readers guessing and on the edge of their seats until the very last page. We watch Shazis life within the Caliphs palace; we witness the beginnings of a rebellion with her childhood friend and love Tariq; readers are left to wonder what could possibly come next out of all this. The storytelling in The Wrath  The Dawn brings the characters to life. Every character in the entire cast from the Theban handmaiden Despina to our protagonist Shazi to the Caliph himself, all hold an aura of realism that is seldom seen in fiction. Its wonderful and instantly makes you connect with the characters. In a novel where a king kills a bride each day at dawn, readers can only wonder if everyone will make it out of the story with their lives. This only adds to the suspense. The Wrath  The Dawn has it all. Romance. Action. Adventure. Thrills. Plot twists. Even elements of magic. Its a novel that has something for everyone. Not to mention the will they wont they chemistry between Shazi and Khalid leaves you questioning your morals. Can you really fall in love with a man and character who murdered the protagonists best friend? Can you really fall in love with the monster and the man inside? Is there more to it? The mystery leaves you reeling! And once the truth is revealed... Such a good book. Hands down, The Wrath  The Dawn is one of the best releases of 2015. I would recommend The Wrath  The Dawn to readers who are looking for a novel that they can genuinely lose themselves in. Readers who are looking for a lengthy novel that they could very easily finish in one siting should also give it a look. Readers who are fans of stories that include romance, action, and mystery with some fantastical elements will fall in love with The Wrath  The Dawn.
I dont want to talk about it either. I will surely have to rewrite and edit this review many times, because my thoughts are way too scattered right now to form a cohesive thought about the conclusion of this epic story. Wolf  Scarlets story: I was so sad every time our characters were separated, but especially when these two werent together. Especially considering they hadnt been together since book two, in Winter their reunions were always cut so short, it was so sad. I was so scared with what happened to Wolf in this book, being made into an actual monster, because the affect in their relationship worried me, but as always, Marissa Meyer didnt disappoint. In this book, Meyer shed a different light on Wolf, we got to see a bit more inside his head, and how difficult it is for him to fight to be good, to differentiate right from wrong, from real and falsity. As for Scarlet, this book only reinforced my adoration for her. Her developing relationship with Winter was one of this books highlights to me, especially when you see how different she manages her when comparing to Jacin. They both have their own unique, special, and effective way of maintaining or at least trying to maintain Winters sanity. Scarlets resilience is something that I ADORED in this book, and something I missed in Cress, since we didnt get many of her chapters there. Cress  Thorne: ABSOLUTE FAVORITE COUPLE IN THIS STORY. Im sorry, I knew I had said that I loved Wolf  Scarlets story more, but after Cress and now Winter, every scene where they were together, I was invested 200. They stole the scene each time, and their story was the one I kept waiting for. When theyd gotten to Luna, and Cress was left behind, my heart literally broke. The one person I never wanted to be left alone, because she was so vulnerable, was her. She was terrified of being back in Luna, because of her past there, and for her to be stranded so soon into the story was heartbreaking, but then her story develops fantastically when Winter comes in. Even though I was aware of her vulnerability, I still wasnt surprised every time she acted heroic; she was brave and loyal throughout the entire book, it cemented my love for her. As for Thorne, as always, hes my favorite. His character develops SO MUCH throughout this series, and at the same time, he stays true to himself. He just...decides to be better...for himself, for Cinder, and for Cress. When he loses Cress right after theyd gotten to Luna, hes distraught, and were able to see how much he truly cares for her, and not only that he feels responsible for her. Their scene at the Lunar party, you know the one. THAT WAS EVERYTHING. I literally reread that chapter like five times, it was everything I hoped for. Winter  Jacin: Oh my GOD I never expected to love Winter was much as I did, but her character was so unique, and heartwarming, you instantly adore her, not necessarily despite her questionable sanity, or even because of it, just her character as a whole was a truly stunning masterpiece. She had so many dimensions, and characteristics that were so appealing to me, I dont really think Ill ever read anything like her ever again. Truly spectacular. As for Jacin, he was everything I hoped he would be. His loyalty to her, his bottomless well of devotion and adoration towards her stunned me again and again, and it was one of the most heartbreakingheartwarming things about this book. Individually, their characters were pretty fascinating, but when they were together, they brought many aspects of each other, something that I, as a reader, loved to experience. Cinder  Kai: I loved them. Everything about them was perfection, how united and strong they were for each other throughout the book, and how even though they were apart for most of the time, they were always looking out for each other, always thinking about the other, and working towards an outcome where they could be, not necessarily together, but united in some shape, way or form. Cinders resilience was beautiful throughout the book, she never faltered, always worked toward her goal, and same goes for Kai, who was always, in his own way, working to achieve a common goal. Levanas downfall: SHE DESERVED IT. I cant really say much without starting to write in all caps lock because of the hatred I feel towards her, so Ill leave it at I DESPISE THE WOMAN, AND SHE GOT WHAT SHE DESERVED. The ending: I cant say Im 100 satisfied, although when I think about what was missing from the ending, I blank. Maybe its the selfish part of me, that just didnt want the seriesbook to end; what Im ECSTATIC about is that a compilation of short stories will be released soon, and there will be an EPILOGUE that will pick up two years after Winters ending. So I might get some of my notsoimportantquestions cleared up. Im VERY excited for this to come out, and Im ecstatic that I have SOMETHING to look forward to that has to do with this remarkable series, because I thought that wouldnt happen after this book! Also, Im not 100 I loved Cinders ending, of her decision to abdicate her position as queen. I think she wouldve made a tremendous queen, and I know it wasnt ever really a question of wether she would be, it was wether she WANTED to be, and it was clear from the beginning that the answer was no; for that reason only Im okay with the ending, and also because HELLO, this way Kai and Cinder can be together. Still, it wouldve been nice to know that she didnt go through all of this just to renounce her throne, but I know that wasnt the importance; she saved all those people from Levanas tyranny, and only she couldve done that. Luna will be fine with a republic government, Im sure, and maybe Cinder will end up Empress instead of Queen. So, technically, she still rules. : See what I did there? Ok Im done. I LOVED THIS BOOK, and Im heartbroken its over, but I really couldnt have asked for a better ending. This was perfection. Marissa Meyer, youre my idol.
You can find more reviews here IndianBookLoveAffair I received a digital copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Actual Rating 4.5 Stars The Winners Curse was the last book I read in 2014 and it careened on to the list of my top favourites of 2014. So I when my request to read The Winners Crime on Netgalley was approved , I am not ashamed to admit, there was a lot of squealing and dancing around :D Marie Rutkoski has gone to the Dark Side. There is no other way to say it. I wonder if when she sat down to write this sequel, she decided to challenge herself to make sure her readers go on a roller coaster ride of feelings and rip our hearts out! Well, Maam you definitely succeeded there. My feelings took such a bad hit that I have been in a bad book hangover and have been unable to pick up another book since yesterday! The book starts of where The Winners Curse, with Kestrel in the Capital, engaged to Prince Verex and Arin, a governor of the newly Independent of Herran. Kestrel, in her misconstrued attempt to protect Arin makes a decision that will haunt here for the rest of her life. Arin, oh sweet Arin, is so invested in Kestrel that refuses to see what is right in front of him! Rant Starts Kestrel was a stubborn headed mule, who believed that she knew the best for everybody while Arin was so lost in his angst of understanding that he made a mess of everything. And both of them forgot to do what they should have done in the first place: trusted their guts, their feelings. This book was filled with one misunderstanding after the other. There were times that I was actually screaming at the unfairness of it all. I wish I could rant about every single unfair thing that happened in this book but that would be against the rules of non  spoilerish review The biggest downside of getting an ARC for review! Trust me though, when I tell you, that book will grab your insides and twist them until you are screaming in pain and blubbering like a fool. And do not even get me started at the ending! DAMN YOU, MS. RUTKOSKI!! How could you? How could you do that to us? Was torturing us throughout the book not enough? Was putting my feelings through a ringer not enough? I still love you though, Ms. Rutkoski! Your writing floors me xx I truly and honestly hoped that it wasnt the end. I had truly believed that no author would truly cut her readers to pieces I had honestly forgotten about Queen Rowling and Uncle Rick! And dont even get me started on The Emperor and the General Kestrels Father. The Emperor is a Class I douchebag and he actually physically made me sick. The General, though on the other hand, I actually thought was redeemable at one point in the book, but his actions proved me wrong. How could a father, a parent ever make a choice that he did, is something I will never understand! Rant Over Intellectually speaking, I understood the choices both Arin and Kestrel made. I would have probably done the same if I was in their places, but honestly being someone who is a third party observer with vested interests in their happiness, it was all I could do jump into book and knock their damn heads together. Going into this book, I kept my fingers crossed, that this book wouldnt actually be affected with the Middle Book Curse, when everything that has to go wrong for a trilogy, does. In other words, half of the middle book in most series turns out be boring and absolutely unnecessary to the plot line. Thankfully, my prayers were answered. This book was beautifully written, and was fast paced enough to make sure that I never wanted to put the book down. It is filled with betrayal, loss, and enough action to keep your interest peaked for the next page, the next chapter till you reach the end of the book and realise that you arent ready for the book to end. Yes, there is again the predictability of in the characters behaviours and actions. But the wonderful writing and the emotions it evokes in you quite beautifully masked and keeps you from recognising the same. Kestrel, shows an acumen for ruling an empire, with her manipulations and strategic thinking. Yet, she also shows enough heart to understand the hypocrisy of the empire and its brutality. Arin, on the other hand, did become whiny and angst filled, but not enough to grate on your nerves. He grows as a person and as a leader of the rebel group, so beautifully that it wasnt hard to respect and admire him. But what irked me, was that both Kestrel and Arin let the misunderstandings come between them. Yes, I know that it is important to the development of the storyline, intellectually, but doesnt mean that it didnt screw me up emotionally. I am honestly in love Ms. Rutkoskis writing and the way she paints a picture with her words. For an overactive imagination like mine, this series is a perfect match! Its going to be very hard to wait for the third book in the trilogy, as yet unnamed but I will. Because Ms. Rutkoski has given me no choice. I will however reread both the books when I get the physical copy of this one, when it releases.
We remember the past, live in the present, and write the future. 3.5 Stars. One of the best ways to get me interested in a book is to tell me there is a character that is obsessed with outer space! I picked this book up for the science and the aliens, but it is mostly a high school drama. Despite the concept, it was very realistic. It wasnt what I expected, but that wasnt such a bad thing. Your entire sense of selfworth is predicated upon your belief that you matter, that you matter to the universe. But you dont. Because we are the ants. Aliens have been abducting Henry Denton since he was thirteen years old. When he is sixteen years old, they finally communicate with him. The world is ending in 144 days, but Henry can prevent the disaster if he pushes their red button. For most people this would be an easy choice, but Henry isnt sure the world deserves a second chance. He is a punch line at school, a ghost at home. Hes relentlessly bullied at school, his boyfriend Jesse committed suicide, his mom is struggling to make ends meet, his dad abandoned the family, his immature brother is about to be a father, and his grandma is suffering from Alzheimers. He struggles with the guilt that he is the reason for his dads abandonment and his boyfriends death. Hes exhausted by lifes endless disappointments and humiliations and thinks the world might need a clean slate. But one day he meets Diego, a mysterious new student, and he starts to get the tiniest bit curious about what the future might hold if he does push the button. As human beings, were born believing that we are the apex of creation, that we are invincible, that no problem exists that we cannot solve. But we inevitably die with all our beliefs broken. The first chapter packs a punch. Life is bullshit. It hooked me from the opening line! We Are the Ants is 455 pages, but it reads like 250300 pages. The writing is breathtakingly gorgeous when Henry waxes philosophical about the universe and our place in it. It deals with so many issues, but it never felt like too much. The central focus is mental illness, suicide, and bullying. The peripheral issues become part of Henrys decisionmaking process. During the 144 days, Henry asks the people in his life If you knew the world was going to end, and you could press a button to prevent it, would you? Not many people believe Henry is actually getting abducted by aliens, so its treated as a hypothetical question. It was really interesting to read everyones answers and the reasoning behind their answers. One of the things I loved about Diego is that he believes Henry, but his main goal is to help Henry see the beauty in life and to help him want to push the button. Henry also writes short essays about all the ways the world could end and those appear every few chapters. Some of his theories are scarily realistic while others are hilarious. If a kid looks like he doesnt give a shit, its not because he doesnt believe in himself anymore; its because no one else believes in him If you want people to treat you normal, you have to act normal. I never asked to be treated normal, Charlie. I just want to be left alone. Henry is an awesome character and so easy to root for. He is nihilistic, but he has a great sense of humor and an interesting way of looking at the world. It is heartbreaking to witness the endless violence committed against him, but it is even more heartbreaking when you realize he doesnt think he deserves any better. The supporting characters were all interesting and none of them felt extraneous. One of the great things about this book is that Henry has positive relationships outside of his love life. He forms a sweet relationship with his brothers girlfriend. He has an amazing bond with his grandmother. He has a supportive teacher that sees what a hard time he is having and tries to help him, while also giving him space. She reminded me of teachers I had in high school, coincidentally also in the sciences. I also loved the appearance of Dr. Janeway, which Im assuming was a reference to the captain in Star Trek: Voyager! My least favorite characters were Jesse and Diego, but we are seeing them through Henrys idealization especially Jesse. I loved how Henry actually has to deal with his issues within himself and is not completely cured by finding love again. The world pretty much sucks. But the bad shit that happens doesnt cancel out the good. The books length is probably what made all of the characters feel so real, but some parts felt too long. Reading the obsessive thoughts of a passive character for 450 pages was exhausting. The repetition drove me from empathy to exasperation by the end. The abuseapology cycle happened one too many times. His progression was slow; it was one step forward and two steps back, until we go about twenty steps forward at the end. Its definitely realistic, but not always riveting. Henry is abused at school, but he doesnt even get a break from violence at home. His brother Charlie is constantly harassing him. The way Charlie lashes out at Henry seems way beyond brothers fight, and then they move on: Charlies age, the onesidedness, the frequency, and the description of Henrys injuries. It makes the typical annoying sibling behaviors take on a cruel tinge. While we do learn that Charlie is more complicated than we previously thought, his awful treatment of Henry is just accepted. Depression isnt a war you win. Its a battle you fight every day. You never get to stop, never get to rest. Its one bloody fray after another. I didnt get the kind of ending I expected, but it was appropriate. Hutchinson drew a parallel between Henrys situation and Jesses depression and suicide in a really unique way. Its a very realistic and honest story. It really emphasizes the importance of the bonds with our fellow humans Im thinking especially of a touching scene that involves Henrys grandmother and photos. I thought a lot about the The Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness while I was reading. That book also had a unique premise and a focus on mental illness, but I never really connected with the characters. If you liked the idea of The Rest of Us Just Live Here but were hoping for something a little deeper, youll love We Are the Ants. Warning: bullying, violence and sexual content. The universe may forget us, but our light will brighten the darkness for eons after weve departed this world. The universe may forget us, but it cant forget us until were gone, and were still here, our futures still unwritten. We can choose to sit on our asses and wait for the end, or we can live right now. We can march to the edge of the void and scream in defiance. Yell out for all to hear that we do matter. That we are still here, living our absurd, bullshit lives, and nothing can take that away from us. Not rogue comets, not black holes, not the heat death of the universe. We may not get to choose how we die, but we can choose how we live. The universe may forget us, but it doesnt matter. Because we are the ants, and well keep marching on.
This book was an amazing roller coaster of emotion, action, romance and fantasy. I LOVED IT! And now, I need to control myself after that ending and to clear my emotions to write all the things I loved about this book :  This book was epic! Amazing! I love how magnificent and perfect this books are. I have been waiting for this book since I finished CoHF, and right now I dont know how Im going to survive until 2017. I was fangirling all the time. I couldnt stop reading since the first page of the book and since then I was in a roller coaster of emotions. First of all, I love that we get to see more of the Shadowhunters world and more about the Faerie Realm; and also how is the life in other Institutes. I love that Cassie writes in such a beautiful way that the action and the mystery keeps you reading and reading until you finish the book. I love to have love, drama, mystery, funny parts, action and adventure. This book is perfection. And obviously I loved to have TMI characters intervention. I missed them so much. And about the characters... I loved Emma: shes so brave and badass and so funny. I love how in dramatic and tense moments she is capable of making jokes. I love how fierce and fearless she is. Jules, what can I say about you? My feelings towards him are so complicated. I love him but theres a little part of me that is kind of afraid of him; but I love how caring and loving he is with his brothers and sisters, and his passion for painting. Then is Mark...and my god! I just love him too. I love him. I simply loved Christina and one of the things I loved about her was her bravery and her kind personality. She is loyal and kind; and simply love to read phrases in Spanish and to read about Mexico in the book. The Blackthorns are an amazing family: I love how Dru is obsessed with horror movies, how Ty and Livvy are the nerds in the Institute and know everything about computers and Tavvy is so adorable... When you love someone, they become a part of who you are. Theyre in everything you do. Theyre in the air you breathe and the water you drink and the blood in your veins. Their touch stays on your skin and their voice stays in your ears and their thoughts stay in your mind. You know their dreams because their nightmares pierce your heart and their good dreams are your dreams too. And you dont think theyre perfect, but you know their flaws, the deepdown truth of them, and the shadows of all their secrets, and they dont frighten you away; in fact you love them more for it, because you dont want perfect. You want them. I cannot wait for the next book. I simply cant. Theres so much drama and suspense going on in the book and, even tough I tried to read it slowly, I finished this too soon. And now, I must fangirl all over the book because i really need to express my feelings: WTF!? sorry for the expression but theres no other word to express what Im feeling What was that?! That freaking ending. I literally wanted to enter the book and scream at Emma. She says to Mark that they need to pretend to be dating and then Mark says Why pretend? and I was like.... WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? I ship Mark and Christina so hard since the beginning. I want them to be together, I dont want to see her with Perfect Diego but at the same time I want her to be with Diego. And i dont know why, but the only thing Im certain is that I ship Mark and Christina. I think that she can heal the part of him that is suffering and broken, and I want so bad to see Mark being happy. Is there a name for this ship? Because in my mind the ship name is kind of weird. And I want Emma and Jules to be together. I dont care what the Law says I want them together. And when I was shipping so hard Mark and Christina and you read the scene where he is kissing Keiran, I was shocked. What in the world? Is Cassie trying to kill me? Then, when Kieran sees Mark talking with Christina and the next day he appears with the Leader of the Wild Hunt and he is going to be punished, and Jules interferes and he takes the lashes but then Emma knocked him out with a rune and then she takes the lashes... That was one of the hardest scenes I have ever read. Because just before the Faeries appeared Mark was saying to Julian that he was his brother and that he loved him. And Jules and Emma had knwoledge of each others feelings ... So yeah, Cassie wants to kill me. Jules and Emma. That scene in the beach is like Whoa, it took Jace six books and Will three to have sex and Jules less than a book. And also, since im talking about them, when Jem told Emma of what might happen if two parabatai fall in love was shocking. I have might suspected something like that because when Jules is hurt by the arrow and Emma remember her life with Jules and saves him and the rune has this weird glow; but still is shocking. I want them to be together and I think they are going to find a way to be together without getting mad and destroying themselves in the process. I absolutely loved the scene in the Lottery when they are dancing and they can feel each others feelings and when Emma is breaking up with Julian and he says that he wont give up on her... My poor heart And my complicated towards Julian are that I love the kind and loving part of him but like someone said because right now I dont remember who said it, he was a fierce heart... I never in my life imagined that Malcom was going to be the villain. He seemed so kind and funny, and the way he treated the Blackthorns was really nice. I actually tough it was Diana, because she was so mysterious and she rarely appeared in the Institute. But it shocked me. And that he was trying to bring to life his love that died many years ago. I actually thought that someone was trying to rise a demon or bring to life Sebastian and I was like not again, please. But now Annabelle is alive and we dont know how she is and what might happen. Then, you are casually reading the book and then this appears: On your feet, Christopher Herondale. Weve been looking for you for a long time. OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! THE LOST HERONDALE IS FINALLY HERE! AND TESSA IS THERE! AND JEM TOO! AND THE LOST HERONDALE! Too many feelings. I loved many things about this book. I cant even recall all the things I love, because if I do, this will be a loooong review. So now, I have to wait until 2017 to read the second book. So yeah, I finally finished my fangirl episode and the other thing I can do, other than wait until 2017, is give this perfect book 5 stars :D
Uprooted wasnt even on my radar until I stumbled upon it on Goodreads, and then saw raves and then even more raves about the book on Twitter. I read the synopsis, and by then it was pretty much a given I would read the book  I mean, what else can you expect after I saw the word dragon in the blurb. I was convinced that this was an amazing book, and then I got to touch it at Barnes  Noble as I was buying it for a friend, and boom, I wanted the book for myself. Being the decent person that I am, I gave that copy to her, but I got myself a copy on my Kindle right after and started reading it the next day. I fell in love. Im a shameless romance junkie, so of course the first and foremost reason I reached for this novel was because I suspected there would be a romance between the main character Agnieszka and the Dragon who does have a name by the way, but Ill keep it a secret since its more fun when you find out on your own. What made this specific book so interesting is that it didnt milk that romance for all it was worth. No, in fact, it seemed to do quite the opposite. For one, the Dragon was the most churlish male character I have seen in my entire life. I was serious when I said that he could give Mr. Darcy a run for his money. I tried being annoyed at him for it, but it was so darn cute I just couldnt manage it. It was like the Dragon had been disconnected from humanity for so long  hes lived for a long time, after all  that churlishness became his resting attitude. Seeing his reaction to the unkept, clumsy Agnieszka stumbling about his castle was all the more fun to read because of his ungentlemanly demeanor. The romance puts the slow in slow burn, yet I couldnt complain. At times, it hardly seemed like the Dragon and Agnieszka were growing closer, but it soon became clear that for them, growing closer meant the Dragon became more tolerant of her. Not the most romantic of notions, but he genuinely began to care about her, whether or not he realized it. It was a different approach to romance, and I appreciated it. What makes this book so astounding is that this is a standalone High Fantasy. I repeat: a standalone High Fantasy. It has been so long since I read a fantasy novel that didnt end up evolving into a trilogy, or the more recent fashion, a five or six book long series. Believe me, I love getting more books written by some of my favorite authors, but Noviks standalone is very refreshing. The author managed to put just the right amount of character background and curiosity into each page, and by doing this, she managed to pace the plot in a way that made sure the reader was never bored. After getting used to authors writing six books to tell the story of a single character, I really enjoyed Uprooted knowing that I had no cliffhanger to fear, and that all my questions would be answered within this book alone. Fantasy standalones seem to be a fading concept, and I hope that more authors will take the initiative to write more of these, because they truly are a delight. The main character was a very unique aspect of the novel, and not least because of her hard to pronounce name. Agnieszka. Im afraid Im probably butchering her name every time I say it aloud in my head. Anyways, I absolutely loved her character, as we get to learn about her in so much detail. Shes clumsy funny how thats the first thing to come to mind, brave, stubborn, devoted, and loyal. She never gave up on the Dragon no matter how much he pushed her away, and in a similar fashion, she never gave up on her friends. She remained innocent and good throughout the novel, but she grew in spirit and independence through her many trials. Its fascinating how much she challenged the Dragon and everyone around her even though not many would suspect as much from a girl like her. I also love her best friend, Kasia. From the synopsis, youd think readers would hate her, but though she and Agnieszka are extremely different, theyre borne from the same cloth. Theres unequaled courage in both of them, and I greatly enjoyed seeing their relationship grow stronger as the story went on. You wouldnt think that a story where the villain is a Wood would be too interesting, but its surprising how deep the plot went. The writing and the plot pacing lent the idea that we were reading a classic. The Woods story was so allencompassing that even now its impossible not to be in awe at Noviks storytelling. The novel is so different than anything that I have ever read before, and I would recommend it to all readers, not only those who read Fantasy or Young Adult. I believe this book to be a delight to readers of every sort  Novik has created something truly beautiful, and I am so glad I was able to experience it. P.S. For any who were wondering, the Dragon is but a person. He can do magic; unfortunately, he cannot turn into a dragon. But hey, we cant have everything.
Well, that was an unexpectedly good read! I was at first hesitant to touch this from the fact that the recent Dystopian YA novels I read were not that satisfying, and I didnt want to be disappointed again, but thank goodness I braved my heart and tried this one, because its definitely better than many out there that I had the unfortunate chance to read. I absolutely adored the writing of this book, especially the world building and the delivery of the political dilemmas that fortunately take place majority of the time Which I really appreciate, as Ive come across a couple of romanceheavy books who guise themselves as Dystopian. The author has written the world in such a way that I could actually picture it in all its detailed glory in my mind. Some writers overdo it with a lot of similes and sugarcoated words, but not Ms. Marissa Meyer. She has written in a manner that even though there may be pages of details, you still cannot get enough of it and want to read more. I believe this may be credited to the structured flow of the narration  natural and not forceful. The information is not imposed on the reader and that itself makes a lot of difference when it comes to the reading experience. As for the dialogues, while the are not perfect, they still deliver. I havent encountered anything that made me cringe or roll my eyes. There may have been some cheesy interactions between the Prince and Cinder, but nothing to make a big deal of. Like the narration, they didnt seem forced, and were actually natural, which can also be said the same for the romance between the two. It greatly annoys me when two people fall in love with each other quickly, because I know in real life that it takes time for people to truly know and love each other for who they are, so I was very happy to see that it wasnt the case in this book  the escalation of their romance was slow, yes, but steady, and very... unpretentious? It made me appreciate Cinder more, especially when she found out some revelations about her true self and how this would affect the Princes perception of her... that totally pulled my heart strings and made me feel for her. sniff One thing to consider here is that the first book is basically a retelling of Cinderella Cinder, ahem? in a... well... mechaish world. With cyborgs and androids and stuff. Its a very cool concept, original even, and something actually hard to pull off properly because it depends a lot on the world building. Fortunately, since Ive already stated that Ms. Meyer is an astounding writer, she was able to pull it off amazingly well. All the elements that are needed in a Cinderella story are there while they still, at the same time, remain faithful to the world Ms. Meyer has constructed. Yes, there are stepsisters and a stepmother who can be frustrating and condescending; yes, there is a Prince worthy enough to be swooned; yes, theres the ball, the dancing, and the dresses; yes, there is the shoe that gets left behind... they are all there and MORE! I assure that this isnt just a retelling, its a reconstruction of the fairytale that will leave you surprised and hungry for more! Usually, adaptations of original works can make people uneasy, but not this one. It went beyond. The characters arent your ordinary characters as well okay, fine, maybe the stepmother and the antagonists evil are still evil, and Cinder is a heroine that anyone can sympathise with especially in regards to the conditions she was forced to grow up in, but she is also a character that can amaze anyone and inspire them especially on how she took the problems and revelations that life threw at her. She had lived a difficult life, but instead of giving in and succumbing to it, it made her stronger and a better person. She knew what she wanted and had her goal set at it. Her sidekick, Iko, was definitely a joy to read, too, as well as the rest  evil or not. Now what I liked the best here are the political dilemmas. In my opinion, a dystopian cannot be called a dystopian without some form of politics, because dystopian basically means a reconstructed society. Back to Cinder, the politics here while predictable were still a joy to read, because, hey, at least there are some, right? But the best thing about it is the politics is NOT a background, its what MOVES the story. Basically, the politics IS the story, and Cinder, Prince Kai, Dr. Erland and the others unfortunately have been mixed up in it. Because of this and the chain of events that happened, the novel became even more exciting to me as its not just a matter of what will happen to Cinder and Kai? but also of what will happen to the world? To wrap it all up, its a great Science Fiction, Dystopian novel and is meant to be read by people who want to know the ingredients to what makes an awesome Young Adult story. All the necessary elements are there with a bit more of sugar and spicy to make things thrilling. The ride is not over yet, though, and I impatiently wait for the next novel! Can also be seen on The Social Potato.

If you have not read this fantastic New Adult Romance series by JA Huss you are missing out. You need to go oneclick those bitches now! The first rule of Shrike Club is never talk about Shrike Club. Breaking that fucking rule right now. For those on Facebook, be sure to join us on Facebook where we talk all things JA Huss, The Team and all the crazy pictures that come from our recon work. I want to be on the team! Guns picks up where Bomb leaves off. Spencer, Ronin  Ford are hard at work trying to ensure they stay one step ahead, bringing in Rook, because she sort of caused it all and then Ashleigh becomes part of the team when Ford married her. Everyone is on the team, everyone but Veronica. Spencer knew he wanted her the moment he saw her. He knew that he would love her and one day give her everything she deserved. But in order to make his claim and follow through on his promises of forever, he has to make sure he doesnt end up locked up for the crimes of his past, the crimes of Rooks past and for all the trouble they caused with their conjobs when it was just the three boys stealing money for fun and their own form of justice. And the only way to keep his Bombshell safe is to ensure shes far away from him and the storm thats coming. Veronica Vaughn knows that she loves Spencer but she is tired of being pushed away and not being worthy enough to be part of the team. With every attempt to move forward, Spencer pulls her back in. She knows she can handle whatever Spencer has to tell her, but just cant see that he is pushing her away because he loves her that much. Ive known you guys the longest, I get trusted with shit? I get nothing from you, Spencer. Im no one to you. Why? ... .... Because, baby, I love you enough to push you away.

A mysterious man comes to town that has his eyes set on Veronica, each member of The Team finds themselves with their own personal problems to deal with. As they get closer to being able to close this chapter in their lives and move forward with the women they love, all these problems start to seem like less of a coincidence and more like a setup. Holy mother of all bosses, JA Huss delivers with this book! I wasnt sure what I was going to get when Spencers story started. It wasnt until Bomb that I saw him as something more than just the tough biker guy who was just a giant flirt and sex on two wheels. His character was holding so much of the weight of everything on his shoulders. The only one that wasnt getting to his cake and eating it too. Watching Ronin  Ford with the women they loved, while he had to constantly fight himself to keep his Bomb at arms length. He was fucking perfect. But Veronica  Spencers story wouldnt be what it was without the glimpses into how they started. Not just the day on campus that he saw her for the first time, but the stolen moments they had where they fell love. JA Huss does a great job weaving both the past  present together seamlessly. The memories we get to read about fit into the story as it is unfolding and there is no jagged transition from one to the other. So much dimension was given to Spencers character throughout his novella and this novel. He remained tough, but you clearly get to see his more calm side; the planner in him, come out. And Spencer dirty talking is hot, but Spencer sweet melts the panties right off of you. But no matter what, no matter how many times I take her body, no matter how public the taking, no matter how dirty the talk  the thing that turns me on the most about my Bombshell is the shudder that runs through her body each and every single time we get started. Its my drug, and Im addicted to it. That shudder says, You rock my fucking world, Spencer Shike. Tell me what else we like, Spencer. His smile is small and crooked. Almost sad as he reaches over and laces his fingers in mine. We like to hold hands too, dont we? The what else do we like moment in this story had me in tears. My heart was filled with so much love for these two while breaking completely because their lives werent anything like they wanted them to be in this moment. The whole gang had their parts to play in this as well. Ford was typical Ford and even hotter with his protective streak showing when it came to baby Kate and Ashleigh. Ronin was still waiting patiently for Rook to come around and Rook was finally seeing a side to a life she never thought shed want. But a huge part of me loving this book had to do with the story as a whole, a story that stayed true to itself over the course of seven books. A story that came to one helluva explosive ending that had you on the edge of your seat scared and excited to turn the page. And then we get the epilogue... and then we get to see a moment that you didnt expect and it breaks your heart in so many ways and just as the tears fall, JA Huss gives you a classic Ford line that has you laughing again. Just when you think it couldnt get any better, you turn the page one more time... looking for that sexy robot and instead you get a bonus epilogue... and this epilogue is the kind of thing that will start riots in the streets for JA Huss to give her fans what they want. Hands down one of the best epilogues ever. Do not wait to read this book. Oneclick this bitch now and tell everyone you know that they have to read this. Prereview: Spencers book! Cant wait for this one, is it March 31st yet?
55 stars Trigger Warning: addiction, griefloss At age twentyone, Auburn Reed has already lost everything important to her. In her fight to rebuild her shattered life, she has her goals in sight and there is no room for mistakes. But when she walks into a Dallas art studio in search of a job, she doesnt expect to find a deep attraction to the enigmatic artist who works there, Owen Gentry. For once, Auburn takes a chance and puts her heart in control, only to discover that Owen is keeping a major secret from coming out. The magnitude of his past threatens to destroy everything important to Auburn, and the only way to get her life back on track is to cut Owen out of it. To save their relationship, all Owen needs to do is confess. But in this case, the confession could be much more destructive than the actual sin. I had read three books written by Colleen Hoover prior to reading Confess and I loved all of them. None of them quite hit the 5 star mark though. So, when I picked Confess up I was excited but wasnt expecting to get blown away . I always love Colleen Hoovers writing style and how she creates an effortless relationship between her characters whether it be romantic or platonic. Im just not crazy about the teacher student , cheating on partner , borderline abusive physical, emotional, intellectual, etc. relationships which were present in the three books I read; Slammed, Maybe Someday, and Ugly Love. I was expecting another scandalous relationship in this book but it never really presented itself. It was a normal, acceptable romance that made me want to hug everyone in a ten mile radius. Tonight, everyones focus is on my art, but my focus is on her. Shes the most interesting piece in this entire room. Auburn Reed and Owen Gentry meet spontaneously. Auburn stopped by an art studio on her way back to her apartment and saw a HELP WANTED sign posted on the door. Before she had time to even process the job opening she was pulled into the studio by a young, handsome, and talented artist, Owen. Right from the onset you knew these two were going to be best friends...if not more . Their personalities melded well, they were able to keep a steady, not too awkward but also not too familiar, first conversation, and lets face it theyre hilarious together. There are people you meet that you get to know, and then there are people you meet that you already know. This book did have a kind of insta love but it didnt feel like it. The characters fit together so well that you forgot that they had just met. They also went through the regular steps of a relationship; meet, date, etc. instead of jumping right into the honeymoon faze. Selflessness. It should be the basis of every relationship. If a person truly cares about you, theyll get more pleasure from the way they make you feel, rather than the way you make them feel. I feel like this quote doesnt just apply to romantic relationships. If you are in a relationship, platonic or romantic, you know you truly care for them if their feelings come first. And this doesnt mean you should go to the extremes. This can apply to small things. Thats what I love about this book. It may be fictional but the struggles that the characters are going through are realistic and they are plausible. People can connect to their situation and take strength in the words, feelings, and understanding captures in every line. And, for people that arent going through these struggles they can still find comfort for whatever they are struggling with now or in the future. Fucking heels, she mumbles. Only she isnt wearing heels. Shes wearing black flats, but she blames them, anyway. This was such a funny book. There were parts where I almost cried from laughter. Owen and Auburn had such a great relationship. When one is feeling awkward or mad the other will just crack a joke and theyll remember how much they love each other. There were just so many great dialoguesone liners in this book that I will definitely be using in the future. She seems a lot like me. A loner, a thinker, an artist with her life. And it appears as though shes afraid Ill alter her canvas if she allows me too close. She doesnt need to worry. The feeling is mutual. The writing! OMG Confess joke...now you have to read the book. Colleen Hoover has a way with words. I dont know how to explain how beautifully crafted each scene, character, and small piece of dialogue was. You can tell Colleen Hoover loves what she does and puts a little piece of her soul in every book. I love you so much. His voice is breathless and full of fear. Ill love you forever. Even when I cant. My tears fall harder at his words. And Ill love you forever. Even when I shouldnt. This book had a really interesting aspect of art entwined. Whenever Owen and Auburn would describe or look at a painting there would be an illustration. The art was just a beautiful detail that propelled the book that much farther. If you are looking for a new adult book that has a solid plot, unique characters, relatable struggles, and just a beautifully written book. Confess is for you. As of now this is my favorite Colleen Hoover book. If you are thinking of getting on the Colleen Hoover bandwagon dont wait any longer!
Reread on audio This is one of the best books I have ever read. Im going to say a lot of personal things on here then go on with the review which will include spoilers, but I will put up the spoiler alert before I do. I also want to add some quotes from the book and the authors note at the end. This book is about teen suicide and bullying. But, its also about some wonderful people, happy moments and a bit of crazywonderful. When I was young I was bullied in school most of my life. I ended up quitting school and getting a high school diploma through the mail, which is legit but doesnt seem so since I never finished school. I never told my family about this and to this day at 43 they still do not know. My entire family think I was just some kind of a loser that didnt want to go to school. Never judge a book by its cover right? When I got sick, physically in 2008 it put me in the hospital overnight and I came out with all kinds of mental disorders. Im guessing they were brewing on the surface as I have always had some anxiety. I came out with severe panic disorder, agoraphobia fear of going outside for me, ocd, depression and then came the physical stuff being fibromyalgia and arthritis from all the hard playing I used to do outside before all of this and hereditary with the arthritis, Im assuming. All of these things turned so bad that I wanted to kill myself many times. I still feel suicidal to this day, and yes I see an psych, no I dont take a million pills, only one for panic. The one thing that held me back was my dog Dakota, I never wanted to leave him, he was my son. Then he had to be euthanized suddenly in Feb. of 2013 from cancer. He just collapsed and then here I am having to kill him. And I thought this is it, I can finally leave and go with him. One out of the couple of friends I have, sent me flowers because she knew he was my son and how much it about killed me much less me killing myself. Surprising to me was that my dad was very understanding and always checking on me since I cried every day. My family knew I always said I wanted to leave this world when he goes, so I guess he was a little worried. And my stupid self let my family and doctor talk me into getting another dog. Now here I am with my rescued greyhound and I dont want to leave her, but I tell you I feel the pull of suicide a lot. I even tell her about it. Her name is Lucy. The reason Im telling all of these personal things is I want some people to know a few things from someone that really thinks about these things. It doesnt make any of us freaks and we cant just get over it. Thats what people say in this world with mental illness. If its not physical its not real, well I would like them to walk a day in any persons shoes with any kind of mental illness. If we could just get over it we would have freakin done that by now. Im going to add a quote from the book that sums up how I feel personally and I know alot of people feel the same way. QUOTE FROM BOOK Amanda stares at her hands. I can only tell you how I felt. Ugly. Disgusting. Stupid. Small. Worthless. Forgotten. It just feels like theres no choice. Like its the most logical thing to do because what else is there? You think, No one will even miss me. They wont know Im gone. The world will go on, and it wont matter that Im not here. Maybe its better if I was never here. Quote finished This gave me chills because I have said that in my head and out loud so many times. I even asked my parent why they even had me. And you see so many people seem like they are ok, they can hide these things. Look at Robin Williams, it doesnt matter if your rich or poor, if something is going on with you and there is nothing to be done or no one sees it... thats it. Being lonely sucks! Okay, lets move on to the review! SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT I fell in love with Finch from the very beginning. I liked Violet too, but its Finch that steals the story. He is fun, crazy, seems like he is so full of life, but hes not.. Finch and Violet meet at the top of the bell tower at school. This was not a planned meeting, this was a random meeting of two people that where thinking of committing suicide. Can you imagine, someone messes up your suicide attempt. These stupid, insignificant prats are yelling for Finch to jump. They should have the crap beat out of them. People like that make me sick. Anyway, Finch ends up talking Violet down from the tower but lets everyone think its the other way around and she is labeled as a hero. They end up being friends, but not without a lot of pushing on Finchs part. Violet doesnt really want to be around anyone too much. Her sister Eleanor was in a car wreck with her almost a year ago and Eleanor died and she didnt. Violet feels like this is her fault because she told her to take the iceslicked bridge. So Violet has her own issues. She wont get in a car, things like that. Sweet, wonderful Finch brings out all of the good in Violet. Brings her back to herself. They do a cool report for school together where they wander around and look at wonders in their town. Its so wonderful and I would love to do that! They do fall in love, and I was so hoping this would help Finch. But throughout the book he is still fighting these death feelings. He has a mom and two sisters, but they dont see anything wrong, they just say that is Finch. He has a dad who left them for another woman and her son and he is a big jerk of a dad always saying Finch is a loser etc. I think Theodore Finch is a wonderful character. Just like so many out there that take there lives or lose their lives. I can see how wonderful he is, but he just cant. Obviously, Finch takes his life, but Im not going to say how he does it. Im not going to say any more about this wonderful book but to tell everyone to read it! Read it! Understand it! Love it! These things are real! People like this are real! And there should be no room left in the world for bullies or people that dont understand mental illness. Get off your high horse and let others live the way they want and try to have some compassion! I cant find the other quote I highlighted but I think I got my point across! Im going to put the Authors Note in here because I think it is another important thing for people to read. Im not going to add her personal parts of the note because that may not be right to do unless she asks me too. Im just going to add the basic parts and some hotlines. AUTHORS NOTE FROM THE BOOK Every forty seconds, someone in this world dies by suicide. Every forty seconds, someone is left behind to cope with the loss. In All The Bright Places, Finch worries a lot about labels. There is, unfortunately, a good deal of stigma surrounding suicide and mental illness. Often, mental and emotional illnesses go undiagnosed because the person suffering symptoms is too ashamed to speak up, or because their loved ones either fail to or choose not to recognize the signs. According to Mental Health America, an estimated 2.5 million Americans are known to have bipolar disorder, but the actual number is a good two to three times higher than that. As many as 80 percent of people with this illness go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. If you think something is wrong, speak up. You are not alone. It is not your fault. Help is out there. End of partial AUTHORS NOTE Some hotlines: SUICIDE PREVENTION 1800273TALK  suicidepreventionlifeline.org DIAGNOSING MENTAL ILLNESS IN TEENS  helpguide.org I recommend this book to everyone! www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com
Actual rating: 3.5 Initially I was putting off reading this series because I am not huge on the whole cyborg thing. I didnt know if I was going to connect with a cyborg MC and if the whole futuristic setting would do it for me. I normally prefer fantasy. I like my knights. I like my magic. I like my pseudoMedieval setting. With scifi and anything that comes close to it you expect science and technology, which are things I dont particularly care about. The Lunar Chronicles is a strange mix of both: there is magic even though it is closer to the Force, Star Wars style, as a principle instead of your typical fantasy magic and there is technology. Unfortunately or fortunately?, the whole time I was picturing the use of magic like this: As far as reading habits go, I have long learned the lesson that I have to try out new things and sometimes books I have initially dismissed turn out to be quite enjoyable if I give them a chance. So...I gave this book a chance even though only because my local bookstore didnt have anything new and I just picked it up out of ...boredom, I guess. Now, briefly : The things I loved: the setting, the backstory, the fast pacing  Cinder. The things I didnt quite love: Prince Kais overall awesomeness  the fact that the setting was awesome, but the worldbuilding wasnt more detailed because the potential was huge. See? If those aspects of the book were more developed, it would have been one hell of a novel. Everybody loves a snarky, sarcastic heroine, right? At least I do. I prefer them this way to the kindhearted, beautiful and sweetly naive MCs we normally get. However, it is a problem when sarcasm overrides all other reactions and the heroine acts as a spoilt teen. There is a fine line between being funnily sarcastic and spoilt, and Cinder, unfortunately, gravitates between the two states. Not always, but frequently enough to make me notice. The spoilt and unpleasant state is most obvious when it comes to her communication with Dr. Erland: Cinder tilted her head. Dont they pay you enough for corrective eye surgery? I like the way these feel. Dr. Erland dragged the holograph down, revealing the inside of Cinders head. Speaking of eye surgery, do you realize youre missing tear ducts? What? Really? And I thought I was just emotionally withdrawn. She pulled her feet up, hugging her knees. Im also incapable of blushing, if that was going to be your next brilliant observation. On the other hand, when left alone she is quite pleasant and as weird as that sounds, human. Yes, that is one of her most predominant characteristics: being human. I know some people had a problem with this considering she is a cyborg, however it wasnt an issue for me. True, she has some mechanic parts, however, she still is human, her mind, her emotions, everything is human. She is not an android: she was born and raised, felt emotions and built a character. Which in my book makes her human. Of course, everybody is free to interpret this as they like considering we dont really have cyborgs in real life. Particularly for me, I shouldnt have worried about the cyborg part to begin with but you know, pride and prejudice. Another impressive thing is that unlike the original Cinderella, our MC is not an overworked silly bimbo, who just takes every bullshit her stepmother  sisters throw at her. Cinder is overworked, but she realises that she does not deserve the horrible attitude she gets. I do appreciate the fact that we didnt get a Disneystyle heroine at all. Since the book is almost solely focused on Cinder, the rest of the characters  prince Kai, Dr. Erland, Adri, Peony, Pearl, Queen Levana  are not really that developed. True, we get some chapters from prince Kais POV, however they are not enough to help us build a complete image of him as a character. It is a bit onesided  the wellintending, handsome prince who is looking for a way to save his people. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but it would have been nice to get some flaw or some dark secret or ... something not that knightinshiningarmor style. I prefer my heroes grey, not all black and white. The mystery surrounding Cinders origins was quite obvious from page 41 my edition , but somehow this didnt reduce the level of interest I took in the plot. I usually get really pissed off when I read something predictable.I take it as a sign that the author is underestimating hisher readers and their intelligence  along with the quite simple ability to put two and two together. However, in this particular case I think the main emphasis was not on Cinders mysterious background, but more on what role her life would play in the fate of the Earth dramatic music ON from now on. And this makes the predictable part of the plot OK. For me, at least. Now, in regards to the setting and the fact that it wasnt as developed as I would have liked. There was only a brief mention of World War IV and I was left wondering what exactly happened, how the world turned out as it did. I enjoyed the setting very much  the only Asianinspired setting Ive read in a fantasyscifi novel was Daniel Abrahams Long Price Quartet, so I was quite happy with the different outlook we got here. Meyers imagination and creativity  amazing. I really do hope in the other books we will get to experience a closer look on the setting because for the moment it is not as elaborate as I would like it to be. I measure a books qualities not solely on their literary characteristics  if style, voice and narration are properly synchronised, for example  but also based on the effect it emotionally exerts on me. As quite often happens, I realise a book is not masterpiece literature, but it moves me and for me this is a very representative sign of the authors skills. What I have been trying to say is that I would always rate a book higher if it has managed to spark some feelings in me, regardless of whether it was a brilliant piece of literature or not. In Cinders case, both aspects are rated in the middle for me. The book is wellwritten, no doubt, but it wasnt exceptional. It was moving, but not heartbreaking or heartwarming. Still the enjoyment factor was higher than simply I liked it, which is why I have rated it with 3.5, but marked 4 since for me it was in the higher end of the spectre. Overall, I have higher expectations for Scarlet and I hope I will enjoy it. I will certainly read anything Marissa Meyer writes from now on.  Link to Blog 
4.35 stars Ladies and gentlemen, Im happy to say that this book is one of the very few trilogyrelated books Ive read in the last few years that does NOT suffer from Middle Book Syndrome. If anything, Hallowed is Hands best yet  I liked it far more than I did the first book, and I feel like Hand as an author really grew in her craft with this one, too. And I didnt want to like it as much as I did in fact, I kind of wanted to punch Clara several times in the face more than once throughout the book  but realized that if I felt that strongly about a character good or bad, then the authors done their job. But there are still some issues I do have in terms of character and world building, so lets jump into those. I still feel like Tucker was definitely not as wellrounded as Christian, who got his character filled out really nicely with lots of information in this book. If anything, I felt bad for Tucker  he was the human that got used and thrown away. Yeah, I know Clara loved him and in the end did what was best for them both, but still. I felt the author also seemed to have more of a thing for Christian over Tucker, and thus filled one boy out more than the other. Im really not into the author doing things like that, and thats what kind of brought in reallife annoyance at a technical issue like this in real life and jerked me out of the world that Hand created. And this isnt even an issue about ship wars or even love triangles Ill get to that in a second, but just about the fact that if Tucker was SO IMPORTANT to Clara, why didnt he get more about him entirely filled out as much as Christian, whos equally if not more important? It bothered me greatly because I hate imbalances with main cast characters like that. If anything, it felt like Tucker was the least developed of all in this one, yet played such a large part it annoyed the bloody hell out of me. Theres still the same problem with Samjeeza, too  for a villain, he got a little more filled out in this story, but both he and the rest of the Black Wings still didnt get as much rounding out as they should have by a middle book in a series like this. We know the basics about him, and we know a little more on the history of the Black Wings, but if theyre such a big threat, I felt like we should have known more about them than we did. The one good thing is, though, and this is the mark of a good writer  Hand is NOT afraid to make her characters suffer and torture them for the story. I love authors who do that and Hand really, really did that in this book. Angst all around and that made me happy. However, she did underplay it and could have pushed it farther than she did, and that was a bit disappointing. Now, to love triangles. What made me forgive Hand for the previous grievance was the fact that Clara made fun of herself and her love triangle situation. I havent seen any other PNRrelated heroine to date whos done that in a YA book so this definitely got brownie points in my book for Hand. I did a lot of crying in this book even with the mention of cancer as a cause of death for Claras mother triggered me, so it was nice for me to laugh until my sides hurt. Claras bewilderment at her own situation was equally great, and throwing in her equal confusion about love triangles in general was an awesome touch that really kind of saved the romantic relationships in the book for me. However, I could have done without the meant for each other thing between Clara and Christian  it felt a little too Twilight, but since there was a joke about that in there, too, I can forgive it. For now. Finally, worldbuilding  the congregation was a nice touch, and really made this world a very real world. This is a world where JudeoChristianIslams teachings are real and are happening, but Hand made it work. However, I did feel that the Moms going to Heaven bit was a little heavyhanded and thus felt a little religiously bludgeoned there. But what I did like was the little information we did get about the Black Wings was more to the Miltonian way of thinking of the Fall, which I greatly liked and felt was more of a balance to the aforementioned worldbuilding. Theyre just guys who ran from their jobs and got really sad. I liked that, and while Satan is mentioned as one of the really bad guys whos just pure evil, it gave a spectrum where not all Black Wings are not truly evil, leaving us to question where our villain Samjeeza is on this spectrum. I liked that balance and open, Miltonian thinking to that situation and welcomed it. The pace was a little slower this time around, agonizingly so, but it had to be. There was a sense of waiting for the inevitable for Clara and her mother, and we waited with them. It was entirely appropriate, as were the death scenes. Even Tuckers reaction was entirely appropriate, and Jeffreys departure did leave me wanting that third book, making us question whether or not his wings will stay grey, or will they go black? That made me hungriest of all, and I feel like Hand underplayed that a bit in wake of Clara and all of her issues, just like Jeffrey accuses of throughout the book. So it seems like Hands main problem here is balance  balance with world and character building. But hey, she got way better in this book, and I hope she improves with the last book. As a suggestion, Id read the first book for information, but really enjoy yourself with this book. Far better than the first, and heres hoping that book 3 with blow us all away with an ending well never forget. Be sure to catch Hallowed in stores January 17, 2012 in North America or at your library. This is definitely one you dont want to miss. posted to goodreads, shelfari, and witchoftheatregoing.wordpress.com
I dont think there enough stars in existance to give what this unforgettable story deserves. A thousand? A milltion? A trillion? If Im being totally honest with myself, it doesnt even need a star rating because that just negates what the purpose of this powerful book is all about. At the essence of it all, its a story about hope, courage, strength, and a young love so powerful it can endure any loss, cross any barrier. There were so many different and INTENSE emotions I was feeling that by the time I was finished with the book, I had to sit with it in my head for a week before I could even CONSIDER writing a review. I miss them!! I miss Poppy and Rune so HARD! Every single day since I finished the book last Thursday, they are in my thoughts. I listen to Tillies playlist just to think about them and cry. Im obsessed and this story will FOREVER ALWAYS be in my heart. I have never ever in the time that I have been reading books religiously, came across a book that I cried through basically the entire thing. At first, from reading various reviews, I was a little doudtful that I would be the one crying in the first 510 of the book. NOPE! was I ever wrong! Literally, about 5 into the book, I was in tears, about 10 tissues in. THIS is the power of Tillie Cole. She has the ability to make you cry over characters you have only known for literally two chapters!! And the more the story went on, the more the tears came. Poppy and Rune have probably the most EPIC, and I mean BEYOND EPIC, love story ever told! From children, they find that they live next door to each other and become the best of friends, and eventually, form such an unbreakable bond, a true and powerful love for each other, that it LITERALLY has the strength to endure everything. What Poppy and Rune go through; how STRONGLY they love each other. There are NO words to describe how Poppy and Runes love made me feel. That young love really does exist, that it has the power to last, and that it has the power to overcome and achieve ANYTHING. Their story was so beautiful and rare, that I went from shedding a few tears, to then sobbing within almost every chapter. I had to take BREAKS from reading because my heart couldnt take it. I think from the whole entire experience, what affected me the most is how much I fell in love with Poppy and how STRONG she was. Oh my god, that girl had my heart breaking and soaring all at the same time. She was so brave, so fierce, so SURE and was way too wise beyond her years!! She knew that everything was going to be okay. That they could and WOULD survive ANYTHING. She saw the light piercing the dark. She saw the good through the bad And she did. She really did. She endured it all, with so much positivity and understanding. With so much love, faith, and bravery, and all with a big fat smile on her face that I found myself saying, BUT POPPY!!!! I wanted to be angry for her! I wanted to break down and CRY and scream FOR HER! But not our Poppy. Her strengh was the epitome of what this story was all about. And Rune, our beautiful Norwegian bad boy with his fierce love for Poppy. How loyal he was to her, doing everything and anything to make his girl, his poppymin, happy. Filled with a love for her so intense, it would last a life time! They really were two halves of one heart And I just couldnt even deal! I STILL CANT DEAL. Im crying as i write this. There were parts in this story where i just had to throw my ipad aside and just SOB, for like a good 20 minutes. Cry for everything these beautiful characters were experiencing. Then when my courage was finally worked back up, I went back in to sob some more. And not because I was sad and yes, there are some terribly sad parts but the breathtaking BEAUTY of Poppy and Rune fill your heart with SO much HAPPINESS, you really cant walk away from this story feeling anything BUT! I recommend this book one hundred and fifty percent. Yes, you most likely wont come out the same, and you will 1000 cry. Probably even so much so that you wont be able to read through your tears. But please, do not hesitate for one second and think that you dont want to read this book because you dont like stories that make you cry. You must!! And you must go in with your eyes closed and your heart open. Poppy and Rune will make it worth while for you. I promise. And when its over, you will be SO happy you did. The overwhelming beauty of this story, its breathtaking portrayal of love, strength and courage, that proves that young love can endure anything that life can throw at it, is what will stay in my heart the most. And while it my heart did break at certain times, it also soared from the sheer perfection that Tillie Cole brought for us in Poppy and Rune. I will forever and ever and ever hold this story and these characters close to my heart, for they are as special as special can be. FOREVER ALWAYS. And if I MUST give this a rating, then a thousand stars from me!!
Horrible things dont happen in crowded places; they happen in the hollows of the world, where its just a victim and an attacker and no one to hear any screams. I dont really understand how Im feeling at the moment. Maybe its because its currently 12:10 AM, or maybe its just because I lost my sanity. I am so confused. He leaves. Just like that. No final goodbye, no last, lingering glance. Like we never loved each other at all. How I felt about this cool book pun intended Aside from the beautiful cover, Ice Like Fire was as equally gripping and addicting as Snow Like Ashes but I do have to admit that it did not give me the same alleviating feeling as it predecessor. I really liked this instalment, because although it was somewhat slow, new characters were introduced and you were plunged into the history and world of the other seasonal kingdoms presented in this series, and it was very cool making connections and seeing how certain relations affect each other. There were many twists and deceits in this book, especially towards the end so if youre having doubts or feel like giving up on this book, just wait until the end, because it gets cray cray, and new relationships were being introduced, even in the weirdest circumstances, which I found a bit comforting with all of the stuff happening in this book. So overall, it was great; Maybe a bit confusing at times, but really, it might be my fault because there are some scenes I skim through just to get to the good part you know what I mean.  CAN WE ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW FRIGGIN AWESOME A CHAKRAM IS?! Lay sorrow in the ice. For all that once was calm, sweet child, will belong to you tonight. Lay your heart upon the snow. Lay your tears in the ice. For all that once was still, sweet child, will belong to you tonight. What was Ice Like Fire about? So basically, Ice Like Fire deals with Meira and Theron, along with Meira and Therons Winterian friends, being set off on a journey to the different seasonal kingdoms in hope of achieving some type of alliance for Winter, in order to give Winter a chance to have an upper hand on Cordellans Noam in particular. This of course, was more of Therons plan and you see Theron and Meiras relationship go through bumpy, very bumpy roads, due to their opposing opinions. Through endless efforts of looking through mines, in which Meira didnt wan to happen but was forced to due to Noams threats, they finally discover the ever strong Chasm of Magic, and Theron is really excited and hopeful in this book because he basically wants to do the greater good. He wants everyone to live in peace and basically thinks that magic is the solutions for all of the problems occurring. Meira on the other hand, is one of the few who is very aware that releasing the magic would also increase the Decay, which is by means evil magic, which forces her to think completely the opposite of Theron. This, you see, starts forcing lies and secrets to blossom, and many relationships to bloom and diminish, and through them you begin to question who you can truly trust. The Winter we know has always been one of our own creation, a kingdom built on dreams. So youre right, Feige. Were all Children of the Thaw. Our own hybrid of the past and the future. The Romance I have mentioned in my review of Snow Like Ashes that I was TeamMeiron, but, I have some other news for you: The ship has sunk a new one has replaced it. TEAM MATHEIRA IS BACK. Bear with me here, I really, really loved Theron in the first book, but as the series progressed, I began noticing more evidently how rushed their relationship really was, especially with Theron, he was desperately clingy, and the world love was used to loosely frequently, which made it lose its meaning and importance. Im not saying that Mather and Meiras relationship wasnt instalove either, but at least they grew up together, so it was understandable; also, I got more emotion out of them. My heart literally broke in each scene they had together, which trust me, were not enough. So I now pronounce myself a Matheira shipper. Proceed : The most powerful magic of all is choice. All in all, this was a somewhat satisfying sequel to Snow like Ashes. I do wish more stuff could have happened throughout the middle of the book instead of most of the excitement being towards the end, but nevertheless, it was still full of twists that had me shocked and a little confused, and still had an epic plot. I do hope Meira loses a bit of the MustSaveTheWorld attitude going on though;So we learn towards the end of the book that she has to kill herself in order to save everyone, because since she herself is a conduit, and if the conduit is banishes so does decay, killing herself will basically solve all the problems going on, but of course, no one wants to die, and she admits that.  she does, however, still acts realistic by reacting in ways people would naturally react youll get my point when you get there and realizes all of her dumb mistakes and when shes making a foolish decision, so that kept me from being overly annoyed with her. There were some moments that earned eyerolls from me, but likewise, there were others that were swoon worthy, so the pros and cons levelled out. It was a good read overall, and I hope the third book is much better, because I have sooo many questions that are yet to be answered, and that cliffhanger did NOT help. I hope you enjoyed taking a glimpse at my jumbled thoughts and emotions by reading this review if you have gotten this far. Kudos to you! and I hope you like this book as much as I did or maybe even more. : Predicted rating: 4.5 stars Concluded rating: 3.5 stars
This review was originally posted on Addicted To Romance Summary Lady Pandora Ravenel isnt like all the other debutantes, she isnt preoccupied with looking for a suitable match, or talking non sessically about the weather, she is always looking for new designs for her board games and the best ways to implement them. While doing a favor for a friend, she gets caught in a delicate position and before she knows it she is compromised by none other than Gabriel St. Vincent. Gabriel has spent years making sure he would never be caught in a scandal, and for the first time he is caught but he isnt all that unpleased about it. There is something about Pandora and her resistance to marriage that intrigues him. He knows he will need to convince her that they are well suited, that he would never control or try to change her. But will Pandora discover a life with Gabriel worth the sacrifice, a tender and sweet love she never expect to find... The Hero Gabriel St. Vincent, was raised in a loving home with parents who raised him to be strong and resilient. To be kind and considerate and supportive. Gabriel is careful with the sexual appetites he has and never to be discovered. His fathers rakish reputation is placed upon his shoulders. Gabriel is a hero you can swoon over. He is the perfect mix of both Sebastian and Evie Our couple in Devil in Winter He is charming, tender, accepting but he is also playful and inherited his fathers rakish nature. I loved his character so much, he just makes me smile just thinking about him and his mischievous nature that is sexy as sin. Being imaginative and playful doesnt make you any less of an adult. Gabriel said gently. It only makes you a more interesting one. The Heroine Pandora Ravenel is not like the rest of her family. She is a hellion, was free at a young age to go wild and free and explore. Her mind thinks in different ways and she can be a bit untamed. She doesnt understand societys restrictions on women and refuses to get married and lose her rights as a person and seeing her dreams go out the window. Pandora was a heroine I honestly wasnt sure how much I would like in this one. But seriously, after the first chapter I knew I would really adore her character and Kleypas has such a talented way of winning you over. Pandora is free thinking, spirited, and not concerned with the Ton. She has a crafty mind, very intelligent but says exactly what is on her mind. Plot and Story Line Now I honestly cant say that this is my all time favorite book that this author has writtenBecause I just LOVE everything she writes...but it is the most surprising and crafty romance I have ever read from her. This book surprised me in so many ways, I honestly had high hopes for this book and Lisa Kleypas surpassed all my expectations from this book. And there were so many fun moments, a feisty and clever dialogue that will keep you thirsty for more. The story starts off with seeing Evie and Sebastian together yeah loved this part but it sets the stage for the story and we also get some delightful moments of Westcliff then we see the scandal that happens. Now its all very innocent but doesnt look good in the end. Why would I be amused by the sight of a young woman posing upside down on a piece of furniture? Im not posing. My dress is caught in the settee. And I would be much obliged if you would help me out of it! The dress of the settee? the stranger asked, sounding interested The settee. Now Pandora is all resistant to marrying Gabriel. She doesnt see the need for it. However Gabriel is persistent and convinces her and some of her family to come to an estate for a visit. This is basically where Gabriel and Pandora discover and learn each other and the more time they spend together, the more they fall in love with one another. I loved the built up of their relationship. They have powerful chemistry that is off the charts, and man can Kleypas write a fantastic kissing scene and we see the relationship that Gabriel has with his parents and his siblings. Gabriel isnt sure of Pandora at first. She is so different from any other woman he has met, but he is soon captivated by her. His family easily accepts her too, in fact they are all quite charmed by her. You dazzle me, Pandora. Every beautiful, fascinating kinetic molecule of you. The night we met, I felt you like an electric shock. Something about you calls to the devil in me. I want to take you to bed for days at a time. I want to worship every inch of you while minutes smolder like moths that dance to the flame. As Pandora is of them, she rarely gets such quick acceptance from people.

There is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes do bad things. It Ends With Us is a devastating, evocative story of forgiveness, empathy, understanding, and impossible choices. I had to set this book down and step away from it more than once, I had to take moments to cry and feel and breathe. I had a visceral reaction to every page, a physical ache to forgive the unforgivable, emotional distress over witnessing such devastation, grief over all that is lost. Friendships are born and broken in these pages, lives are saved and destroyed, lessons are learned, souls are crushed, hope is restored and dashed, the people you least expect to hurt you do, the people you least expect to save you will. I felt the raw intensity of falling in love, of falling apart, every note of humor and joy and despair so acutely. I felt this book in a way I know I will never forget. Maybe love isnt something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flows, in and out, just like the people in our lives. Ryle Kincaid, Lilys present day love interest and successful neurosurgeon, is arrogant and sexy and driven and I fell for him instantly. Atlas Corrigan, the kind, affectionate teenager from her past, is beautifully broken and I loved him immediately and intensely. It was difficult to fathom a future for 24 year old florist, Lily Bloom, that didnt include both of these men who were so dear to her at varying points in her life, and my heart hurt knowing we couldnt have them both. Colleen Hoover vividly and humorously juxtaposes the past with the present, threading the heaviness of Lilys youth with the lightness and humor of her diaries to make for an emotional storyline peppered with both devastation and wit. When the two parts of her life converge, the boy from her past who had nothing and the man from her present who has it all, Lily must decide what it all means for her future. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear. Going in, I believed this was merely a romance about a woman whod have to make a choice between the two men shed loved after their paths unexpectedly collided, but I soon realized that It Ends With Us is so much more than I could have ever predicted. This story shattered me. I loved every character thoroughly, connected with them in different but equal ways, and thats why the events in this book are so inconceivable. There was no predicting the course of events that would occur within these pages. Things happened in this story that I never saw coming, couldnt believe were actually happening and everything I thought I knew, thought I believed in, became uncertain. To experience Lilys journey properly, the reader has to first be made to love these characters the way she does, then be blindsided by their unthinkable behavior as she is, and then experience the heartbreaking decisions shes forced to make right along with her... and Hoover deliberately and exquisitely ensures we do just that . I think about Ryle. I think about Atlas. I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide. Ill tell you now that this story is not what you think it is. Its different. Its bigger. Its more. Its romantic, no doubt about that. The undeniable chemistry between Lily and Ryle wars with the passionate history between Lily and Atlas to make for an emotional, tumultuous journey of love and heartbreak. But this story is something else entirely. Its a story of familial drama, of friendship, of healing and rebuilding and finding peace with things that cant be changed. Its about experiencing the best and the worst in people and deciding whats worth the risk. Its a love story... two actually... but to simply call this book a romance significantly dims the brilliance that is It Ends With Us. Colleen Hoover fans like myself will find everything they love about this author within these pages. But readers should set their expectations and preconceived notions aside because, while this story is signature CoHo, it far exceeds anything weve ever seen from her before. Hoover steps outside the box in the very best ways with It Ends With Us, but this isnt just her toeing the line. This is Colleen Hoover making a new box, a bigger box, an extensive, impressive, more polished box. Colleen Hoover just took the old box, the one with Slammed and Maybe Someday and November 9 and Hopeless in it, blew the lid off it, dumped it all inside a huge new box, so all our favorite signature COHO stuff is still in there the humor, the smart dialogue, the enigmatic characters, the captivating storyline, the heavy themes, the raw emotions. But now its a much larger box with a whole lot more stuff in it. New stuff. Beautiful stuff. Powerful stuff. Stuff weve never seen. Things we didnt expect. This new box is glorious and ugly and fantastic. Its a box of CoHo taking chances. Its a box of CoHo getting unbelievably personal while broadening horizons all at once. It Ends With Us is an exciting, fresh box filled with the old classic CoHo and a bunch of other awesome and beautiful things that cant even be named. This new box just blew my mind. In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me. This is, hands down, the best book Colleen Hoover has ever written. Is it my favorite? I dont know how to answer that. It feels wrong to describe the course of events in this book as my favorite anything. It feels wrong to call a book I wish had never been written phenomenal. But Ill call it that because thats what it is. Its the most powerful, beautiful, haunting story this author has ever delivered. Its also one of the most profoundly important books Ive ever read. I was deeply effected by this story. I felt everything this author set out to make her reader feel while reading this book. The love, the hope, the devastation, the grief, the fear, the sadness, the loss, the conflicting emotions, all of it. I got it. I was so far in this story, in these characters, on this journey, I dont know how long itll take me to find my way out. This is not a feel good story. This isnt heartwarming. This is tragic. And its perfect. Every single detail, every brick in the wall of the structure of this story, was meticulously placed by this author and it was done so magnificently. I dont know if its my favorite because this story made me feel things I dont ever want to feel again, but the fact that she made me feel THAT WAY means this story was executed perfectly, that it is, under no uncertain terms, phenomenal.
Review also found  Through The Book Portal You know those book series where you get to the last book and there are so many different characters that authors shove some of them aside to better fit their plot? Or just make them do things completely out of character and so against their personalities that you start to wonder whether or not youre reading a fanfiction? Or that feeling you get when you finish the series and there are way too many questions left unanswered that you feel like it cannot possibly be the last book? If youre worried about any of that from happening in this book, take a deep breath and let it out because this book was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! I didnt think it would be possible for Bracken to pull off this ending with all these characters still intact and wholly themselves but she does and she does it well. This was exactly the book I needed to restore my faith in trilogies. I fell in love with these characters and I wanted to see them thrive and they did. Everyone played their own part whether it was big or small. I was scared of my expectations for this book because I expected greatness but Alexander Bracken as usual did not disappoint. If you havent read it yet, do it now! oSPOILER ALERTo First, lets start off with the negatives. Some people were complaining about how the book was slow and dragging towards the middle which is true but I felt like the book needed it. Never Fade was very action packed with only a few moments where the characters actually got to relax and plan their next step which is exactly what happened in this book. These characters needed a little break from all the fighting anyway and it gave time for a lot of character development. The only parts I didnt like or more, the parts that frustrated me were the ones with Ruby completely cutting Liam off. She kept going off to Cole who is actually pretty cool without giving Liam a reasonable enough explanation. I was yelling at her in my mind throughout the whole ordeal, seriously Ruby, COMMUNICATE! I felt so bad for poor Liam! Also the fact that Cole didnt tell Liam about him being a Red until almost the end was so annoying! It could have really improved their relationship and Liam would have definitely understood Coles need for secrecy. Ruby developed so much as a character. She is very different than she was in the beginning of the first book completely terrified by herself; I loved seeing how confident she became and how in control of her power she was at the end. I was actually glad when she decided to go back to Thurmond, I thought she needed that closure and she probably thought so herself. The books started with her being taken to Thurmond and ended with her going back to get everyone out that right there is great planning. I was also so overjoyed to see Sam again! Ruby fixed her mind and she remembered Ruby and it was just so sweet! And she found her grandma! Or rather her grandmother and parents found her; it was a great reunion! And lets just say Vida and Chubs is PERFECT! I totally saw it coming in Never Fade! I think I love them more than Liam and Ruby. The scene where Vida gives Chubs his glasses all fixed up, it was adorable! The reunion with Zu! I was wishing so hard they would find Zu and they did. When Ruby first saw her and was describing how weak she looked, I almost cried. Sweet little Zu, they shouldnt have let her go in the first place! And the interview she gave with Alice was marvelous. She spoke! She SPOKE! And Vida was the one who encouraged her! I cried; I really did. Like I said before, Coles pretty cool and I do like him but if any main characters had to die, Im kind of glad it was him. I am way too attached to the other characters to handle their deaths. And Clancy. Stupid, idiotic, manipulative, devil child Clancy. Ruby really should have known better than to believe he was under control and would just sit in a cell doing nothing. Come on Ruby! Learn! Its Clancy freaking Gray! When did he ever sit around and do nothing!? Of course he had a plan! I would have been surprised if he didnt. BUT learning more about his past, I did feel the tiniest bit of sympathy for him. Which brings me to Nico. I was VERY VERY VERY mad at him in the last book because of poor Jude. In the Afterlight, however, made me start to love him. He believed in Clancy, he knew him before he went all psychotic powerhungry teenage Voldemort. Nico loved him and love clouds judgments. I liked how in the end Nico went and started yelling at Clancy and I got all hopeful because Clancy seemed like he was going to listen. I think he might have if his stupid mother hadnt burst in. Mother Gray! Couldnt you wait another minute? Ruby wiping Clancys memory was an act of mercy. That was a good thing and it probably saved a lot of people from falling in the other end of his manipulations. The last scene where they were coming out of Thurmond was EPIC! Absolutely, positively AMAZING! How the thousand of kids got out of camp and the parents came out go Liams idea! and the soldiers stood down. satisfied sigh It was good. Just so good. And Chubs. Oh my goodness, Chubs! He was great at the meeting at the end arguing about the Psikids rights. I was so proud! Overall, this was the best ending of a series I have read in YEARS. Maybe since Harry Potter. Brackens writing is so elaborate and beautiful its hard not to love these books. I cannot wait until she publishes something else because I will definitely be reading them.
Our Dragon doesnt eat the girls he takes, no matter what stories they tell outside our valley. We hear them sometimes, from travelers passing through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice, and he were a real dragon. Of course thats not true: he may be a wizard and immortal, but hes still a man, and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to eat one of us every ten years. This book has spellbound me. Naomi Novik has created a beautiful story, and it ensnared me like The Woods she writes of. But first... I want to start off by stating that I really enjoyed this book. I found it incredibly fun, and incredibly endearing. Overall it was just a really charming fairytale, and it hooked me. That doesnt mean Im blind to its faults, and it does have faults. I went in having read two kinds of reviews with little inbetween. One review being a glowing five star, singing Uprooted all the praises they could think to bestow upon it one review I read even called it a masterpiece. The second kind was a one star review taking about how this was one of the worst novels they had ever read, and how they wished they hadnt wasted their time reading it. I read one angry rant that was quite startling in is clear visceral hatred. So naturally when I began reading I was hesitant as to what I would find and ultimately I think Im one of the rarer people who falls inbetween of the two extreme viewpoints. There was a song in this forest, too, but it was a savage song, whispering of madness and tearing and rage. Firstly you have to remember jumping in that while this book is a fantasy, it is first and foremost a fairytale. The characters arent the very well developed, the magic system is pretty shallow compared to the kinds of magic I read in most fantasies, and the plot is fast I mean really fast I got a bit of whiplash with how quickly things progressed. Im not saying all fairytales are like this, especially nowadays with the more in depth retellings, but in my mind this was an old style fairytale. I found the characters and the magic as thin as they were incredibly fun, so while I could intellectually see the flaws and why some people would be annoyed, I didnt care because I was having to good a time. The unraveled threads of my magic were gradually coiling back into my skin. The magic system, despite lacking in detail, was enchanting HA! See what I did there? Only funny to me? Okay, sorry, moving on..., and the dichotomy between the two different ways of wielding magic, and how it came together was a real payoff, and made up for a lot. Not to mention Noviks beautiful description of characters weaving their spells. Still I found Agnieszka came into her abilities much to rapidly for my taste, and more explanation would have been nice. The use of Jaga Baba Yaga, or the shadow of her really, was well done though I longed for her to appear, and not just lurk between the pages. Though in the end that was probably a more effective way of telling the story, and my wanting is a symptom of the skillful use of this device. He was a thing of books and alembics to me, library and laboratory. Despite having borderline onedimensional characters I found the dimensions they did posses enjoyable. Agnieszka and the Dragons interactions were super fun Im a sucker for love hate relationships, and the banter between the two was great. Some may not like the relationship between the two, but I felt it developed nicely, and surprisingly steadily, considering how hyper fast everything else in the novel moved along. The captorcaptee aspect was dealt with smoothly, so there was not any kind of ick factor in regards to the progression of their relationship. I didnt care a whit about Kasia though. Usually Im all for strong female friendships, but I felt no attachment to Agnieszka and Kasias friendship whatsoever. There isnt much of a basis for the friendship the reader is just kind of told theyre best friends, but the reasons for it are simply not shown. And more to the point, I found Kasia boring and wanted her out of the way. Characters who are written to be perfect are probably my biggest pet peeve, and while Kasia did not send me into a rage as some other characters have made me before, I couldnt make myself like her either. I was just ambivalent towards her longing for her to get out of the way, or at least have the decency to develop a few flaws if she was so determined to stick around. Agnieszka to has a bit of the same problem as Kasia. Its not that Agnieszka is perfect its that she has a serious case of being the special one. It didnt become annoying until abut halfway through the novel when I just felt she had become far to special, far to different, to be believable, and it quite honestly took some of the enjoyment away from me. I think my breaking point was when Agnieszka was being tested by the other witches and wizards and showed off just how truly different as special she was, and while it took her only a few months to become a qualified witch, it took most others seven years. Then I nearly laughed out loud when she was going to receive her name, but she was so different and unique, and she didnt get one. I just could not help but roll my eyes at that. There is such a thing as being too exceptional. And no, her clumsiness does not make up for it in the least. In fact I found it unpleasantly reminiscent of Bella Swan. I wanted to rub handprints through his dust. The fast paced plot was jarring to me at times. I would have appreciated more quiet moments, more introspection but perhaps that is just me trying to make the novel into something it was never meant to be. The concept of The Woods was a great one, and did not just add to the atmosphere of the fairytale, but was a unique antagonist, that could have been cheesy if written poorly, but in this case felt like an honest threat. All in all I would highly recommend this book, despite its faults. Its a lighthearted, fairytale romp but if you go in expecting Catherynne M. Valente you are going to be disappointed. Think more Howls Moving Castle, which I believe is a fairly apt comparison, though in truth I would have to say Howls Moving Castle is the superior of the two. But really, despite the criticisms I gave, I truly enjoyed Uprooted. I was completely enamored, and liked it enough to go out and buy a hard copy despite the fact that I bought it initially as an eBook. I also created a Pinterest mood board for Uprooted because I was so taken by the story. EDIT: I originally rated this 3 stars and only recently after a little less then a year bumped it up to four stars, though I have not reread it. I have the tendency to nitpick a novel as I gain more distance from it, and will inevitably find flaws in it I had not noticed upon reading it for the first time. The opposite seems to have occurred with Uprooted. While I still stand by my criticisms, I really do look on this book fondly, and highly enjoyed it. Ive softened to it as time goes by, and since I still have not quite gotten it out of my head I decided to make my review four stars.
4.5 stars And maybe some people are like collages  no matter how broken or useless we felt, we were an essential part of the whole. We mattered. This book tells such a beautiful story. Ive been hearing about this book on all of my social medias for quite some time now and I saw this book at the library and decided why not give it a chance? Im so glad I did. I was not expecting to like this story so much. These characters feel so raw and real and vibrant. Skylar is a young girl who just graduated from high school and shes going to a university in San Francisco at the end of the summer. But this summer turns out to be a lot more difficult than she anticipated. She and her mother live in a trailer, and she finds out her Mom just got fired from Taco Bell, and they dont have a lot of money saved, and her Mom is a recovering alcoholic. Also, Skylars old friend Josh has returned from Afghanistan where he lost his leg in the war. As you can tell b the premise, this story is pretty depressing. The town Creek View where these characters live is a small town in California just off the freeway in central California where there;s not a whole lot going on. The way the author wrote about their town made it feel so real. I could imagine it perfectly in my head. Its the type of small town where everyone knows everyone and you never make it out and a lot of people are poor and living in trailers and have problems with alcohol and drugs, and the best you can do for yourself is work at Taco Bell... It just all felt so hopeless, reading about this place Skylar hated and she couldnt wait to leave, and then all these terrible things happen and she doesnt know if she can leave. But at the same time the author never talked badly about it in a way thats insensitive to people who do live this way. She just captured the essence of what it would be like to live this way so well. I could feel the depression and hopelessness of never leaving a trailer park jumping off the pages. The thing I thought was most interesting about this book is Skylars relationship with her Mother. Man, can her Mom be a real bitch at times. I have seen first hand what its like for a child to have to take care of the parent and I think its so incredibly sad. A parent should never have to force their child to be the responsible one who thinks about the future and has to make the hard decisions, but that is exactly how their relationship is. Skylar lost her Father five years ago in a car accident and he was drunk. This obviously has a huge impact on her family and it explains why her Mom is the way she is, but still. Skylar shouldnt constantly have to pull her Mom out of this depressing pit all the time. I admire Skylar a lot as a character. Shes smart, she puts people in their place when they act homophobic or racist or rude, she doesnt ever want to drink because thats what caused her dad to die, and she doesnt take shit from anybody. Shes my favorite type of female character. I absolutely hated Billys character her Moms new boyfriend. He was that typical disgusting lame excuse for a stepDad who takes advantage of someone in need. I did like the way that Josh defended her and supported her when it came to some awkward situations involving Billy. I also want to talk about Marge, the owner of the motel that Skylar works at. I love her character in this book and I love her motherly relationship with Skylar. Shes truly there for her when she needs it and shes the kind of Mother that Skylar deserves. Marge has a really sad back story as well her son killed himself when he got home from the war because he couldnt take the anxiety and ptsd, and she found him in the bathtub with his wrists cut and I think this is why she relates so much to Josh and Skylar, and she would do anything to protect them. Skylars relationship with Josh was really sweet. I love how he would ask her: Hows the sky today? in reference to her mood, and she would reply cloudy or rainy or howevr she was feeling. I love cute unique things like that, and thats something I will remember about this book. I love how Skylar is obsessed with collaging and she always talks about these vivid and creative collages shes working on. Its like I can see it in my head because of how well the author writes. I love how her and Josh both know what its like to be dirt poor, and they always go out to eat at McDonalds and Dairy Queen and Subway and thats enough for them. I just like that they seem so normal and average. I absolutely loved the scene where they were dancing in the rain by the pool and the hippies were singing Hotel California. That scene was so adorable and wonderful and I love it. And that song fits their situation with the motel she works at and everything.I also loved the Fourth of July scene where they are sitting at the train tracks and he asks her if she could be anywhere in the world where would she be? And she hesitates and then she says: right here. It was so sweet and I think thats when she realized how much she cares for him. This book had a lot of really cute moments between them that I really enjoyed. As far as Joshs character goes, I have some mixed feelings still. His story of being a marine is heart breaking and its so sad to see him suffering from PTSD throughout this story. Hes only 19 years old and he lost his leg in the war, and thats just so incredibly sad. His life will never be the same. But, there were a few times in this story where Joshs character pissed me off. He makes stupid decisions sometimes, and I understand that everyone makes mistakes, but some of them I was like... come on really? Especially when they were about to have sex and he starts freaking out for no reason and then he just leaves like????? And then he goes to some other girls house to get a blow job... Like wtf Josh? I was so freaking mad about that. Thats bull shit. Like I dont care if you were nervous around her or whatever your excuse is, but to go to some other girls house right after and get a blow job? Thats disgusting ugh. I was really disgusted with his character after this scene. I also was upset and confused when Josh invited her to the bonfire and then he totally blew her off and acted like she wasnt even there. Like way to act like a douche bag? But Im also glad that Skylars character is not a push over and she doesnt take shit from anybody and Im glad she puts him in his place when he needs it. She will literally tell him to stop using his marine story as an excuse and Im proud that she said that because its not fair of him to use that as an excuse for hurting her emotionally. Overall, I really did love this book. I just ordered myself a copy from Amazon because I need it on my shelves. Skylar is a new favorite female character of mine. The ending was okay, I personally thought it ended somewhat abruptly and I wouldve wanted more closure on certain things. I want to know if her Mom did end up moving to Florida with Billy and how that would affect their relationship. I also wanted to have maybe an epilogue chapter after Skylars first year of college to see if this long distance relationship is as easy as they thought. I also wouldve liked if on the last page with her and Josh, if he wouldve asked her: Hows the sky? One last time and then she could say: sunny, or its never been more clear or something beautiful like that idk, I just wanted it to happen because I loved that aspect of their relationship. Other than that, this book was such a surprise with such wonderful, realistic characters. This story will stick with me for a long time.
Well, its been 4 months since I read and finished Six of Crows, so I think its about time I reviewed it. Or at least, TRY to. I still remember a lot about it, which is great, but I dont remember everything. So I hope I can still do this book justice, especially since over the course of those weeks, Ive thought about it often. And even started to reread it before its release date, but then I got into a really bad slump, and I sort of gave up on it. But I do want to reread it again, SOON, because its so worth the second look. I LOVED Leigh Bardugos trilogy, even with my lukewarm feelings toward Siege and Storm. I thought the ending to it was perfect; I adored the characters. I fell in love with the way she wrote, how she detailed everything and made it feel as if the world was real. And I was there. That didnt change at all in this companion; it was just a whole other area to such a fascinating world, one that I never knew about. Ketterdam is super different, yet also really similar, to Ravka. And this book can totally stand on its own; you dont have to read The Grisha Trilogy first. I do recommend it, just because itll give you so much background toward the places, and it even references two people, I think, from the other series. But its definitely not required. And I really liked that Six of Crows didnt need to be read after the trilogy. It was easy to separate what was happening in this, to what had happened before. And it was easy to fall in love with a new set of characters. Not that it was hard to fall for them. Not. At. All. If anything, these characters are so much easier to love than the ones in the trilogy. And not because theyre better, or more likable lolol this makes me laugh, but because there is just something about them that make my heart happy and give me so many feels. I fell HARD for them all, but especially Kaz Brekker. Its no secret that I love my broken bad boys, that I love the guys who are damaged and hurtful but who have softer sides to them. But hes so much more than that. His background shaped who he is, pushed him in so many ways, and became the driving force that turned him into the best thief in Ketterdam. And when you start to get to know him, beyond the manipulations and calculated ways in which he keeps his emotions in check and the thirst for power, you start to see exactly who he is. Not just a thief or a conman or a, lets be honest, a jerk. But someone who is just trying to survive in the only way he knows how to. I see that, and so does Inej. 3 She is, aside from Kaz, my favorite of the characters. Inej is a true badass, a boss queen who makes people bow down to her. I love this girl so much, and I just love that shes so powerful on her own. That she doesnt need anybody to save her. She is intelligent, quick on her feet, and deadly. Shes the heroine of her own story, a story that I NEED more background on since I feel like we still dont know her completely. But I loved the way she took control of her life, the way she didnt settle for anything less than what she deserved, even when she knew it could cost her. Her feelings for Kaz werent like a big deal; they were just a part of her. She didnt need romance or a guy to save her. And I needed that, because I feel like that doesnt happen often in YA books. The Wraith has such huge importance in this book, and I cannot wait for more of her. She is that AWESOME. The rest of the characters, Jesper, Wylan, Nina, and Matthias, all have big roles in the book as well. And I loved them too, but Kaz and Inej just hold my heart. Anyway, onto the others. Jesper is hilarious! Hes a sharpshooter who just lightens up the tense situations which makes him a little stereotypical, being THAT character, the comedic one, but hes not. Hes more than he appears, and hes not afraid of just being himself. le sigh I sure do love that guy. And so does someone else. cough Wylan, the privileged runaway, doesnt get as much time on the pages as everyone else and if I recall, he also doesnt even get a POV. But thats okay, because I have a feeling hell have a larger role in the sequel. Also, hes adorable, so well keep him. :D Nina the Heartrender and Matthias the convict had a bit of a history before this, so the sexual tension and unresolved issues between them was played to perfection. I adored how they werent a couple, but they were basically. The whole cast made for such fun and heartwarming dialogue inbetween all of the action. And there is A LOT of action, but the beginning is pretty slow. Leigh builds up the world carefully, and so detailed that it can make for a boring start which Ive heard from several people. But I was actually hooked from the beginning, and I think the largest part in why I love this book so much is because of the characters. They really make the story come alive, with all of their differences and backgrounds and personalities. The multiPOV is never a problem, because theyre all so unique, and the 3rd person narrative does make it easier to tell them apart, but I digress. Throughout the story, the characters are put to the test, and I just went crazy for the plot. The heist storyline had me intrigued, and I couldnt wait to see how it all came together. But man, that ending is a fucking killer and I am DYING for the sequel because I just have to know what happens to my beloved characters! Well. This was surprisingly easy to write, even after 4 months. So I think that goes to show just how much of an impact Six of Crows made on me. All I want is to dive back into this, but Im gonna make myself wait until closer to the sequels release date. But guys, this book is brilliant. It is rich and real and heartbreaking and funny and holy mother of God I just love this misfit group of characters SO much. 3 This is probably making me sound really crazy, but I JUST HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS FOR THEM OKAY PEOPLE?! Rating: 5 Paw Prints!
Oh my gosh, the rating is amazing. Ive never seen such a high rating for such a popular book! average of 4.62 out of more than 26000 people. WOW. Edit: Oh my god, I am desperate to read this book. This book is that kind of book that you dont have to read to know it will be amazing. I try to tell myself not to download the ebook version and wait to order it instead. Even if I have to wait at least a month to get it, I just know that the book is worth the wait. Edit 18 Jan 2013: FINALLY bought it at the bookstore today! Heard the paperback is finally out... Is half way through the book now and absolutely in love! Edit 19 Jan 2013: Amazing, Its definitely worth more than 5 stars. I dont know what to write because this book has completely left me out of words to say or write in this case. The Fault in Our Stars tells a story of how beautiful love is and how it doesnt matter if the two people arent perfect, its the love that counts. I will definitely be reviewing this book later but Im pretty sure I still wont do this book justice... Anyway, just want to give John Green a bow, this book is genius and amazing. Long live the nerdfighters!! Proper Review: I hate to write a review of a book that I love so much. Because I find myself ending up often annoyed and somewhat fidgety because I know I havent reviewed or expressed my feelings and thoughts clearly enough to do this book justice. Im honestly even frustrated right now just thinking about where to start and how to convey such powerful emotion I got from finishing this book into this word limited review. On the other hand, if I choose to not make any further comments on this, it feels as if Im betraying myself. I decided to write an honest review basically about how I feel and what Ive learnt on this journey with this book because Im sure a lot of people already know what the plot is all about.. So here I go. The Fault in Our Stars is amazing and beautifully written. I couldnt stress how much it changes how I view life as a whole. People often take their time for granted and never thought to stop once to appreciate such beautiful things around them. While I read this book, there is this quotation that keeps coming into my head and that is: Life is precious because it ends. John Green is brilliant and truly remarkable to create the wonderful Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who both fearlessly live their days as if it was their last. This novel is like a wakeup call to me and hopefully to a lot of other readers that life is fragile and so short; that love is found even in the most unexpected place in this case The Support Group, Hazel seems to hate so much at the beginning and in the most hopeless time. Even if their love lasts shortly, I believe that it doesnt mean their love isnt real or any less meaningful. Their love story got me crying like idiotic baby at my workplace full with people staring at me like they were dreading for me to start screaming and find a scissor to chop my hair. Life is so unfair, and the world is no wishgranting factory. It depends on how you look at life and the world itself, do you stop living and only wait for the sun to set each day not doing anything or do you embrace whatever comes along a thing at a time? Do you enjoy every second of life gracefully and optimistically or do you just stand there in the dark waiting miserably for it to rain harder? I adore the humor in this book, the light optimism that somehow finds its way in a conversation of these two fascinating characters. I honestly envy them. Not because they are surrounded by their family who loves and fully supports them, but because they make their lives matter, they make their lives significant in their own way that most healthy people couldnt do. They know and appreciate the power of love, they feel the warmth of being alive and I know they know the importance of time, all this in the midst of knowing that the end is near. How very inspiring and truly extraordinary. John Green mentions the ancient Greek word, hamartia, which means fatal flaw. Hamartia is not used that often but it strikes an impression on me for the reason is because everyone has one. Nobody is perfect. This book is a book full with flawed characters: Hazel and Augustus who are beautiful and funny but are cancer patients, Isaac who is hopeful and in love but ended up broken and blind, and Van Houten who is a great writer but an alcoholic and an asshole. However, their flaws intertwine and create a beautiful flawless story of hope and love. When I go through the description of how much pain the cancer patients, for instance, Hazel, has to struggle each day, it reminds me of my own father who has been unconscious and brain dead for 4 years since I was only thirteen. I feel as if I am going through another emotional phase of having to lose my father again when Augustus fell really ill at the end. From a person who completely understands what it feels like to lose someone you love and knowing that you can never get them back, John Green has done an amazing job at describing and conveying it. What hurts most is not the fact that theyre gone, but the pain comes from the memories you shared with the person you lost knowing that you can never make new ones but can only relive the ones you got inside your head. I learnt that John Green got the title of the book The Fault in Our Stars from a famous quotation from a Shakespeares play, Julius Caesar, when Cassius says: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.. Or in other words: Men can control their destinies. The reason that we are oppressed, dear Brutus, is not a matter of fate, but ourselves, because we dont do anything about it. In the old days, it was believed the location of stars and constellations depicted the future showing signs of good and bad omens. Cassius is saying that people control their own lives; however, they rely on things like stars to make their decisions for them and blame these stars when things go wrong which can be applied to religion as well. If you think about how John Green manipulates the quotation above into The Fault in Our Stars after knowing what the original one means then you will truly understand what the title implies. Stars in the title here represents fate and destiny. So, the fault or in other words the flaw, mistake, error, or a hamartia of the main characters  Hazel and Augustus  is not what they do or their actions but their own fate, the fact that they are ill and unhealthy and have a limited time, shorter than others, to live. The fact that they are unable to destine their own future even if they have the power to because god or in this case their stars draw a limit to their lives which if Im not looking too deep into this is a dramatic irony because the original quotation stated otherwise. Cassius says that we can destine our own destiny and that human has freewill but in this book freewill is applied but with limits. Augustus and Hazel fall in love with each other, go to Amsterdam to meet their favorite writer, kiss each other and even sleep together; however, they could not stop death from separating them apart. Despite the hardship that fate put them through, we are reminded that both characters do fall in love  and that is what matters most because love conquers all, even if death do them apart, Hazel will always have Augustus in her heart just like Augustus love for Hazel will live long after the collapse of our sun or even there is no one left to remember. Amen.
A powerful and evocative read. It has been a good 24 hours since I last read the book, and I still cant get it out of my head. Its pretty much plaguing my mind every chance it gets, pouncing its awful reality on my brain like a headache I could not easily get rid off. This book ended me. In the truest sense of the word. Colleen hoover bared her soul with this one. This is the Colleen Hoover I fell in love with. This is the Colleen hoover hitting it where it hurts the most. This is Colleen Hoover not just telling a story for entertainment but so much more. This is digging deeper. This is flaw and perfection. This book hits home. When you literally drop everything youre reading just to read this one book. That constant curiosity and want gnawing at you. That feeling when it is all you think about every goddamn hour waiting for a minute, just one fucking minute you could spend with it. Waiting for unadulterated time, and actually being thankful for traffic or for idle time because you can read a page or two. It is really hard to contain ones emotions when you just wanted to explode and tell every single soul you come across with how erratic your heart is beating, how theres this quesy feeling down the recesses of your being. The adrenaline rush., my heartbeat in 140minute. Gahhh that was what happened to me, I was so attached to it, I practically couldnt function well. There are so many things going on inside my head, Im not even sure where do I get the energy to write this review because I feel like I am so emotionally exhausted. Boy I had to compose myself, I had to pace my room and contemplate about what I just read. It was as powerful as it was raw. It was as heartbreaking as it was real. Hats off to people who have read this and not one bit messed up, because I for one cannot deal with all the rush of emotions Im having all at once. I have so many things to say and I am afraid I may not be able to say everything there is to say. So let me just compose myself a little more. Give me 10 seconds more. You still there? Okay good. You ready to talk about it? To be completely honest, Im not. First off, I heard few friends who didnt like it. Which I completely understand. There is no one book that is for everyone. I guess it is just a matter of how much of yourself can relate to the story. And to tell you, this book hits home. Like it really nailed it where the wound had been and let it bleed anew. Im not one to go into details how much I related to this book. But this book gives you that bigger perspective, that sense of maturity of having to make an intelligent choice. God I wish I could say so much without giving anything away. Since Im always the one to give spoiler free reviews, I will try my best to give the book justice by not delving too much about the details of the book. Lets talk about the characters. There is Lily, a character I was able to relate in more ways than one. I loved how Colleen Hoover made her character reach out to readers, they may not have experienced that same thing her character went through, but she portrayed every woman faced with a predicament but was able to make choices that are selfless and intelligent. Her character was the one that made the biggest impact, she was someone who may have made wrong decisions along the way just like most of us but had conviction to stand by what is right. She was resilient and courageous and I adored Colleen Hoover for sharing such an amazing character. Then there is Ryle Kincaid, a man who has everything but is deeper than what he let on. His character was not hard to love. in fact his character was the one youll immediately fall for, until something happens gahhh I cant tell. And then there is Atlas, that guy from the past, to me he was perfect, to me he was the guy I wished I met or have my own version of. It is pretty obvious that I am Team Atlas from the very beginning. And of course I cant fail to mention Alyssa and Marshall, god I love those two!! So funny! They seriously make the book a little lighter. Colleen Hoover made flawed characters, she made characters that are relatable. She made her characters into this real individuals with demons they have to deal with day in and day out, this was the magic of this book, how it was able to transcend from the pages of a book into the real world. How you can very well imagine that there is someone who is actually just like them in this world. The only issue I had maybe was how every character looked gorgeous and perfect, maybe we could change that? Now lets tackle the whole story. I never read the blurb, I went to this book as blind as one could get. I have literally no idea what it was about when I started reading it, and again I am reminded that there is beauty in that. Not knowing what it was about, not knowing what to expect, not knowing where the story will take you. And I am so glad I didnt read the blurb, I am so glad my judgment was not tainted by what others thought about it. It was as pure as it could get. The story was a powerful one. It tackles heavy topics, something we should be talking about more, something we should not be afraid to read about, something we should challenge ourselves to understand more, something we should not shy away from. This book sent a message, loud and clear. Breaking the pattern, before the pattern breaks you. I had goosebumps whilst reading this book. Not only because I was able to relate to some extent but also because this was a bold and brave move by Colleen Hoover. Not many can write what theyve been through, but Colleen Hoover made this book so significant and relevant you cannot miss the message she was trying to send across. It Ends With Us was different and mature. It was a sad book yet a satisfying one. It was as heartbreaking yet as surreal. It was real life magnified and detailed, it was real life painted in a different light. It was a book everyone should read, not just because it is loved by many but there is a very important message that you could learn from. This book is an emotional rollercoaster, something you thought you are ready for but as it progresses through its loops and big drops, you will realize why the hell did you even ride in the first place, but after all the scare and the heartstopping moments you will learn how rewarding it is. That is exactly what I felt when I finished reading this book. Plethora of unwanted emotions came rushing in, and I could not contain it, it felt like my heart was going to burst, I literally had a hard time breathing, it touched sensitive topics that I would rather forget but I took the plunge, I was all in, and couldnt be more glad that I did. So Im gonna stop here, drop everything and read this. You can thank me later. And oh please read until Authors Note. Hands down to Colleen Hoover! Thank you for being BOLD and BRAVE!
I know the hype with this book is huge, but to me, it is entirely well deserved. That is my final conclusion after deliberating a lot about its merits. Because something quite unusual has happened to me while reading this book. It has left me befuddled and almost unable to make up my mind about it for the longest time. Initially, it completely blew my mind. From the opening chapters, the concept, the execution, the cool graphics, the unusual way it is told by including emails, IMs, transcripts of conversations and video, excerpts of diaries, photographs, diagrams, architectural and technical schematics, etc; the plight of the crossedstarred teenage lovers in the vast setting of the universe, in a long forgotten planet blown to little pieces by a greedy and sinister organisation captivated me. I was sold. Completely. I adored it. I was reading the beginning almost with the opening credits and music of the very first Star Wars movie back in 1977 unfolding ominously in my mind. And with time, the story will remind you of Star Wars in more ways, minus Darth Vaders creepiest voice in the verse. By 78 I was convinced I had finally found the best book of the year, no less. I regretted having bought the Kindle version and I became committed to also buying the hardback edition to proudly display on my shelves and pretty few deserve to live there nowadays, it was so good I thought it deserved to live outside Kindle, out there in the light. But this book is definitely a bumpy ride on a bumpy road and it has left me puzzled and scratching my head. What have I just read? Im really, really not sure. I continued loving it until about 50 or so, completely decided to giving it a 5 star rating as I was totally taken by its seeming quality, and I kept reading with huge enthusiasm, and almost wanting to slow down my reading to fully savour it. Then I felt it dropped to a 4 rating, and between the 6070 mark it briefly flagged even more for me to about a 3.5, and at that point I started being very suspicious of possibly being taken for a ride and being the victim of a very clever marketing scam. Was I falling head in first into the hype of this book, and the mere idea of it? Does the book really have any substance beyond the cool and compelling format? Yes, yes, suspicious mind that I have, but it has happened before, last years overhyped dud for example was for me The Night Circus and I was dreading the resolution of Illuminae, I was dreading the possibility of my disappointment. Luckily it picked up again quickly and the end from 70 onwards was a white knuckle and edge of your seat ride back into the seriously genius territory, which I read to the soundtrack of Space Oddity in my own head. So yeah, Katniss Everdeen and Beatrice Prior can move over now, because here is Kady Grant, a badass heroine if there are any. This girl is tough and rough, and quasi antisocial. And boy, can she bear a grudge, as her ex boyfriend the adorably cute Ezra Mason could attest.  Im sorry I didnt write you back. I should have. I mean, when you say Im never going to speak to you again, you dont think your planets going to be invaded that afternoon. It was more, you know, an opening position on negotiations. I was angry Kady I freaking love this girl. Love her, love her, love her. And when the shit hits the fan, she is the ultimate hero, as it is her ample intelligence, ability as a hacker and sense of loyalty and duty that saves the day. You will hear more about her, no doubt, as Brad Pitt has bought the movie rights and this book will translate into the big screen as a stunningly visual and complex movie. I cant wait to find out wholl be the lucky actress thatll inhabit this most rewarding role. I dont read that much scifi. At least since last years superb The Martian, which was also translated into an awesome movie. But it occurred to me that normally with Scifi movies, and the very few stories I read within the genre, the plot and the action is very externallyeventoriented, and it focuses on situations, battles, explosions, squabbles amongst the crew, some terrible things and conspiracies that are typically devised by the villains, etc, etc. But this book, while following a similar path at times, gives significant protagonism to peoples internal processes as well. It is about the feelings too. And hooray! What a combination. . . A Scifi thriller with heart. Many among the passengers of the battle carrier Alexander and the Science  Research vessel Hypathia are survivors of an unprovoked attack on a lonely planet by a greedy corporation. They are traumatised by events and grieving. There is also a bioweapon attack with horrific consequences, a central computer that can easily pass the Turing test, and does confusing everybody, a complicated lovehate story between the two teens, who actually spend about 0.1 of the Narrative in each others face to face company, and many people are doing so not well that they are coerced to attend therapy. Kady plays tough there, she really is a tough cookie, but then she writes in her diary: I hate the crying the most. It just creeps up on you out of nowhere. Youre in the middle of doing something and suddenly you realize your goddamn eyes are wet again and you dont know how it happened. Yep. A possible case of PTSD. Or could it be something more sinister? I suppose it is very unusual for a Scifi or in this case more precisely, YA Scifi to have THE FEELS, but this one does. I dont know, maybe it is that I am completely ignorant of the genre, not versed enough in it to know better, but if there are a lot more NAYA Scifi books not fantasy, mind you out there with THE FEELS, I really want to meet them, so dear GR friends, please keep the recommendations coming. I would be eternally grateful. Despite my misgivings and potential change of heart half way through, so far I am still going to give it the biggest pleasant surprise of the year A cross between 2001 Space Odyssey, my beloved Joss Whedons Firefly after all, the setting is also in the late 2500s, and some bits of the book even reminded me of the episodes with the frightening Reavers, and a very accomplished angsty NA love story, despite the distance between the two main characters. I wouldnt mind at all spending some more time in the company of Kady and Ezra, even possibly AIDAN too , so Gemina has been eagerly preordered. Luck has it thatll be available in mere weeks.
HOLY SHIT. Pardon the pun, but that pretty much sums up my feelings as I shut my Kindle App with the realization that I would have to wait a few more months before the sequel to this book would be released. The anticipation is going to kill me slowly. This Book. So many things done right for me. From the characters to the pacing, writing and so on so forth. I cannot thank my fantastic friends list on GoodReads for recommending this book to me. Suffice to say, my fire for fallen angel stories has been rekindled. Its a flame that has been consequently put out in the past few years. Not from lack of interest, rather lack of written books which truly explored the characters and concept in a way that would spark my interest. Angelfall however has just made it to my list of topfavouritebooksofalltime. One of this books strongest points is its characters. Especially the two main characters; Penryn and Raffe. Penryn is everything I want to see in a heroine of a fantasy novel. Shes a great balance of vulnerability and strength, both physically and mentally. Penryn is well versed in a variety of martial arts which I am quite familiar with. Props to Susan Ee for doing her research well. Penryn is survivor and not an attacker, she only uses her skills very believably so to defend and disarm while attacking when necessary. Many authors tend to write strong female characters with unbelievable moves usually followed by the idea that she is the chosen one and I love how grounded her character was. It enhanced her humanity while actively enhancing the unnaturalness of the new world and its invaders. While being strong, she is still very distinctly female and loyal to a fault at times. Her love for her sister Paige and her torn mental state about her slightly deranged mother was written out very well. Her wit was well timed and I like how she did not fall head over heels for Raffe while acknowledging that he is indeed an amazing otherworldly being. While I feel some people may have issues regarding how she did not ask as many questions as the reader themselves would have liked, I did feel like it further strengthened her character growth. With so many things assailing her at one time, with the world ending, her sisters kidnapping and a angel to take are of, the idea that some level of ignorance is bliss makes perfect sense to hold the threads of her sanity together. Her growth from detesting and distrusting Raffe to gaining respect for him was really enjoyable to read as well. Raffe is a male character that I think most people cannot help but love. While there is still a lot we dont know about him by the end of the book, he is a perfect balance of bad boy and good boy that he comes off as a nice meaning occasional ass. There is a sense of maturity to him which I find very compelling and yet there is a youthfulness with his interaction with Penryn especially their banter. Goodness their dialogues are amusing. I must admit that the revelation of his name and status came as a shock to me even though I later on thought it should have been obvious. That gets accolades from me for leading me up to not see it till the big reveal. His cocky wit is handled very well and how he treats Penryn is very well written in my opinion. They both shield and protect each other and even though he is much stronger in many ways, he doesnt treat her like glass. That shows a level of respect characters have for each other. His human side is also very enjoyable to read and infact makes him it so much easier to relate to him. He is very much in my list of favourite written male lead characters of all time too. Their relationship or somewhatromancebutnotreally is handled well. It isnt a love at first sight thing for either party and may be too slow for some people. I adore their development in this aspect though. It is both real and refreshing as I look forward to seeing how their relationship builds on from where it is right now as there is obvious attraction and many obstacles. It however does not turn either of them into simpering idiots and they both prize respect from each other first and foremost rather than outward affection. Penryns mother and sister are well written too. I wont delve into Paige too much as it may move into the realms of spoilers but the schizophrenic nature her mother displayed chilled me to the bone. It was also rather close to home for me as I have a friend whose sister tends to display similar tendencies and it freaks me out. With just mere words, this character brought out the same feeling to me as well. Enough about the characters, the concept of the world ending and the angels swarming upon the earth without prior warning is not the newest but I daresay this is one of the best executed that Ive read. While we dont get much details about the war, later revelations makes this point quite alright seeing as it is written from a POV standpoint. That and the little bits and reveals we do get is very intriguing. When we are introduced to the other angels and a larger view of what the war is about, it gets even more interesting. Prejudice amongst angels of various rank, colour and origin and hinted past history really adds to the flavour of the story. The carnage and the variety of humans encountered along the way was very well thought out as it covered a wide range of reactions to the end of the world as it was put. There were both the severely disturbing and the utterly heartwrenching. The one thing I was not expecting from this book was the level of gore. Not that there was a lot in comparison to some other books out there but there was enough to make me think of this book as more of a urban fantasyhorror as opposed to a YA novel. It isnt written in extreme graphic detail but what was written gave me chills. Coupled with a vivid imagination, my mind was not pulling in pleasant images but it definitely enhanced the reading experience. There is quite a bit that may unsettle people who are not prepared or unused to rather graphic depictions of different deaths and... creatures. It extends to something later on which pulled at my heartstrings while making me want to run screaming in the opposite direction in horror, as if I myself wanted to turn away from what was unraveling in front Penryns eyes. The ending of the book came for me too soon. Not because it was rushed, rather because I kept dreading the end of the volume as I wanted it to continue forever, the climax was incredibly exhilarating and my heart literally kept pounding as I read on. I wont spoil it for you all but the ending made me want to scream and cry for Penryn and Raffe. Especially Raffe. I wonder if Penryn will play a bigger role in the human resistance against the angels in the later books, while juggling her family issues. There are so many things I want to know, about the other angels, about Raffes past, about Penryns family, the reason for the outbreak but that will have to come later. To put into summary a very long and hopefully not too fangirly post, this book is an amazing debut book from an author who has a gorgeous way with words. As an artist, I can say that sometimes a book is most successful when it evokes images and scenes to me that makes me want to draw it all out and this book has done just that. There is a life to these characters and Susan Ee has given us a wonderful new series for us to chew on. Who would I recommend it to? Right now, just about everyone. The book isnt out in stores yet but the digital version is going for only 99cents right now limited time only I think. Thats an amazing deal for a fantastic book. Go get it now from here.  If you dont have an iPadNookKindle, download the free Kindle reading app for the computer and get this book. Even if you perhaps may not love it as much as I do, Id say its a fantastic addition to anyones library. Support this brilliant new indie author, who has given me one of the best books Ive read from the 2011 releases. Cant wait till summer 2012 :D
