I just want to spend more time in the Lunar world, and this book gave me that fix. I read most of the stories before reading Winter, but read Princess and the Guard and Something Old, afterwards. Most of the short stories serve as characterspecific prequels; if this were a TV show, each one would be the flashbacks of an episode focused on a particular character. Meyers characters are wonderfully realized, and her continuity impeccable, so these prequels were most welcome. I especially enjoyed getting to know Michelle Benoit better, who is a very pivotal character considering she gets very little screen time. One story, however, is not like the others. The Little Android concerns a brand new character, and is an adaptation of Little Mermaid... but not the happyeverafter Disney one, but the really dark original tale, which ends in tragedy. Here, Meyer shows how gifted she is at crafting fairy tale adaptations as if there were any doubt, by cleverly hitting all the fairy tales beats while seamlessly tying it in to Cinders world. In a stroke of genius, Cinder herself pops up as the Sea Witch. This short story had me getting awfully mistyeyed at the end. And the other one that breaks the mold is Something Old, an epilogue to the series that features Scarlet and Wolfs wedding. Its a great twist of irony that the one successful epilogue across YA literature isnt included in its corresponding book! But Something Old was all I could have wanted  we find out what happened to our favorite characters in their happilyeverafters, and got to spend a few dozen more blissful pages in their company. All of the warmth, humor, and heart of this gang pours from the page as we watch them banter, and actually get a chance to relax. I will sorely miss spending time with them. Just a few final words about this series. People have been telling me to read it because its wonderful for years, but I never expected it to be as great as it actually was. I completely immersed myself in Meyers world for a month and a half, and never wanted to come out. Her books have plentiful virtues that Ive been extolling in all my reviews, but above all else, theyre just fun. They provide a feeling of coziness, a place I want to return to and hang out in as surely as Hogwarts or Camp HalfBlood. So, Ive learned my lesson, and the next time Marissa Meyer releases a book Ill be at the bookstore on release day.
I gave it 3.5 stars America has absolutely zero desire to enter the selection. She has been in love with a boy in a lower class then hers for some time and Aspen is the only one she wants to be with for the rest of her life. To please not only Aspen who loves her and only wants the best for her but also her family she enters anyways thinking there is no way that she would ever make it in anyways. America not only makes it into the selection but she decides to give it a chance and her life is forever changed. America is not like most girls vying for the attention of the Prince Maxon. She is there for the money for her family and that is it. Once she is in the house and finds out Maxon is nothing like she imagined she cant help but feel drawn to him and want to spend time with him. Everything she felt coming into the situation is turned on its heels and she is just a bundle of confusion not knowing what she really wants. I have mixed feelings about Aspen. You could tell that he loves America but him pushing her into the selection then wanting her back kinda ticked me off. Maxon, I really like him. I am totally rooting for him and hope that Aspen doesnt mess up Maxon and Americas chances. but of course where would the drama be if that was how it went The whole Selection reminded me a lot of The Bachelor There are a bunch of girls from different situations vying for one guy that will change their lives. Some are in it to find love and others are in it to find status. There was a lot of predictability in THE SELECTION. I was able to see what was coming next on most occasions. I really enjoyed most of the characters. There are so many personalities thrown in it made for some great situations. The romance is chaotic like you would expect. Lots of cattiness and awkwardness. The world that the book is set in is well explained and easy to imagine. Im sad that we didnt get farther along in the story before the book ended. Of course a lot happened, Im just impatient lol. After getting through the book Im way to invested in the story not to read book 2 when it comes out.
Firespell is the first book in a new series, the Dark Elite, by Chloe Neill. Its a fun read, albeit one which suffers a bit from a common problem with the first book in seriesit spends a lot of time setting up the premise an intriguing one, to be fair and not as much actually moving the plot forward. Which means the second and subsequent volumes may hold my interest a bit more. Lily Parker lives in upstate New York with her parents, professors of philosophy. When the senior Parkers take a sabbatical in Germany, Lily does not accompany them, but is instead sent to St. Sophias boarding school in Chicago. While there, Lily runs in with a brat pack of snooty mean girltypes; she also becomes good friends with her roommate, Scout, who has a habit of sneaking out late at night. It turns out that Scout is an Adept, one of a magically gifted group of youngsters fighting against the Reapers, who preserve their magic past its sell by date by stealing the energy of others. Lily wants to join Scout and the other Adepts, but can she help them when she has no magic of her own? There are a lot of things to like about this story, despite its flaws. I really liked the relationship between Lily and Scout, and the way Lily stood up to her bratty classmates. Neill does a good job of depicting the banter between her teenage characters, and its fun to read, but it also slows the plot down. My synopsis doesnt go any further than the blurb on the back of the book does, yet by the time you know this much, youre already at the middle of the book. I was also rather lukewarm about a romance that doesnt quite manifest itself, but maybe teenage readers would appreciate this element more than I did. I was reading for the supernatural element, and was dismayed by how long it took to arrive. And my final quibbleanother one which may improve as the series goes onwas with the number of characters who were introduced and left to flounder. I had a hard enough time keeping the brat pack straight; when you get into introducing the members of the Enclave, the situation became quite hopeless. As the series goes on, I hope more of them will gain purpose and personality, but right now they are just more names and faces to keep straight. Id call Firespell a fun read, a cute introduction to a series with promise, and I hope in later installments the wrinkles will be ironed out.
John Green sums up my feelings about his new book, The Fault In Our Stars, in one of his quotes,  Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all humans read the book. I am a huge fan of John Green. Ive loved all of his books for his brilliant writing, hilarious moments of humor, highly intelligent girl characters, and deep human connections. This book is my new favorite. 16yearold Hazel has cancer. Shes had it for a long time and will for however much longer she will live. She is sheltered. She attends college classes with her oxygen tank in tow, but her main social interaction is her parents. Her mother makes her attend a support group, one that is normally depressing and boring. That is until one day when Isaac brings his friend Augustus. Augustus is a cancer survivor. He wont stop staring at Hazel, which both thrills her and freaks her out at the same time. You see... Augustus is gorgeous. With Augustus, Hazels world expands as she explores a deep friendship and love. I dont want to say more than that. Sometimes you just have to experience the book and anything I have to say about their beautiful relationship would not give it justice. Hazel has a favorite book about a girl struggling with cancer. The author never wrote a follow up and Hazel would love to know what happened to the characters. When she has a chance to meet her favorite author, who is a bit of a recluse, it makes for an odd experience. While reading that section I thought about the time I met John Green, who is one of my favorite authors. He came to my library to talk to teens. He was extraordinary with them. Afterward staff had lunch with him and we had a wonderful talk. He was just as personable and funny as he is on his you tube videos. I made him a cake that looked like the cover of Looking For Alaska, which would seem weird for anyone who is not part of his fan community. He told me the cake tasted awesome and seemed to really mean it. So my experience meeting a noteworthy person I admire was the opposite of Hazels. I felt fully immersed in reading this book. The characters seemed so real to me and I felt great sadness when they were in pain and struggled. Teens will love this book, but I am glad I read it as an adult. When you are a parent and you read this you get another perspective. Reading this book was a rich experience. I worried about the characters in between my times to read and couldnt wait to pick
The connection between Kat and Daemon is stronger than they thought. While Daemon tries to prove to Kat that his feelings is not a product of their connection, a new guy Blake arrives. But something in Blake makes Daemon distrust him. And the discovery that his brother Dawson might be alive unveils more lies in a world that Kat has stumbled upon. It just got better! This second book just raised the bar for the series. I had a lot of thoughts while reading this book and most of them is me gushing about Daemon. LOL. But before the girl gushing part, let me get to the story first. I have nothing to complain about the story. This book has a lot more complications compared to the first one. It is more about the secrets that lurks in the corners of the lives of the Luxen. However, this time around Kat is part of that secret because it turned out that they have more than the Arum to worry about there is the DOD Department of Defense which is scarier than the Arum and the new breed of humans that is the people that the Luxen heals. Yeah I know it sounds so Xmen. Lastly there is the possibility of Dawson being alive which revealed more lies and betrayal. There is a lot going on in this book but as I was reading it, it didnt feel that way because I know that they are connected. That got my brain going. Thinking what the connection is. It was teasing my brain. Half of the book was spent with Daemon trying to win Katys heart and there were a lot of heart stopping, jittery feeling and Katy frustrating moments. Daemon is really changed here, he showed a lot of emotions and he became a much stronger character. I just LOVE Daemon in this book. He melts my heart into a pile of goo. LOL. I found myself smiling whenever he pursues Kat. I like the way the author made all the exchanges betwee him and Kat funny and romantic at the same time. And Kat was turning into this frustrating character that I wanted to shake more than a dozen times. No matter how much Daemon showed his heart she just refused to believe it. The worst part is that her being stubborn led to many bad choices. And even to the death of a character. I will not blame it all on her though. I mean as frustrating as Kat was in the book she has her reasons and the best part is that she came around in the end. This book has a lot of Katy and Daemon written all over it. They dominated this book. I am guessing it has something to do with the next book. This is one exhilarating, forgetaboutsleeping, swoon over Daemon, action packed book that you would not want to miss. Yes, that is how good this book is.
See our joint review directly on the blog here . Melody: Before I read this book, I was told it was going to be slow in the beginning. I didnt find that at all! The book hooked me from the start. Im guessing they meant slow because for most of the beginning of the book you are mostly getting the protagonists memories which made for excellent world building which I loveeeeeeeee. Betsy: The book had me wrapped around its pretty little finger from the very beginning. Word around town was that it was a slow book but I actually enjoyed the pacing GASP!. The world building, as Melody mentioned, is PHENOMENAL. It was incredibly vivid and descriptive which really made the difference to me and gave me a real understanding of what had happened. Melody: I honestly loved all of the characters and I really enjoyed being able to glimpse into their points of views. It was always a glimpse for something that really mattered, something that was important to see in their point of view. It really made me connect with every single character. I honestly felt that the protagonist was strong and weak at all the right moments. Betsy: The friggin characters! I loved them all. Can I just say... Nugget is the cutest thing in the universe! And EVAN!!!!! GAHHHHH. fans herself. You know its an amazing book when you WANT to be in other characters POVs. I was really impressed with Cassies character. I feel like she was the perfect combination of tough, vulnerable, bad ass, and innocent. It really blew my mind how much I connected with her especially since the author is a male! This never happens, people!!! Melody: One of the things that really wowed me about this story was that the author is a male. I felt that he wrote from a girls point of view better than some women have! Betsy: Can we talk about the ending for a minute?! Holy crap! I just about had a heart attack. It might have been the slower pace at the beginning that made the ending so epicly fastpaced and intense but, HOLY HELL! The feels were going 100 MPH. And theres a crazy twist that I. DID. NOT. SEE. COMING. LOL. Melody: I loved this book so much and the ending pretty much left me in a puddle of feelings and I really need for the next one to come out. Thank you Rick Yancey, for giving us a fresh look at an alien post apocalyptic story.
I am so late to this party. Better late then never, right? Cinder was completely worth the hype. Although the book wasnt perfect, it was damned near. I finished this book in one day. Cinder is an adopted child, who works as a cyborg mechanic. Cinders work supports her and her step family. She is also a cyborg, which she tries to keep people from knowing. When the prince Kai shows up to her shop with a job, Cinder is completely smitten. She might have been in the running for his hand if it werent for her evil stepmothers plans to keep her busy. In this world there is a plague, Letumosis, threatening the people with no known cure. The king has that Letumosis and has very little time left, and there is also a looming war if the queen of the lunar colony, Levana, is not appeased. When the plague strikes close to home Cinder is forced to do her part for the community. Levana pays the people of earth a visit and flaunts all of her magical glamour over the palace. Cinder and Kai both end up in really bad situations and major secrets are revealed. Cinder has two step sisters, just like Cinderella, but one is actually kind to Cinder. This book uses the skeletal outline of Cinderella, but it is unique and completely different. There is an orphan and a step family, and a prince, that is where the similarity ends. Cyborgs, science fiction, and a plague...there really isnt much similarities there to Cinderella. The stepsisters were a bit of a surprise, with one of them actually being a friend to Cinder. The step mother is spot on in her resentment to taking care of Cinder. This is the perfect beginning to what is sure to be an epic series. Cinder is well paced with rich character development. The world the author has created is rich with places I want the characters to explore. I want to know more about evil Levana and the Lunar colony. I have to know more about the Lunar race, which is different from human and has magic. The prince was such a sweet character and I adored his reactions to Cinder. It is the ideal start to a series, setting us up for the follow up book, Scarlet. Although I loved the book, I guessed the twists. Half way through the book I told my daughter, who has been trying to get me to read this series for about a year, exactly what would happen. I was too far invested though, and had to see if my hunches were correct. I just have to remind myself, this book wasnt written for me. It is a YA book and so I can understand why the twistsending was such a surprise. Even though I guessed what would happen, I still really enjoyed this read. Anyone who has read the book can understand why I just have to read on to the next in the series. I doubt anyone could really read this book and not want to see what happens next.
Backstory: I love this book so much. It was my first true favorite book of all time. Love it!!! I was so excited when this book came out. I didnt know what to expect though. I didnt think it would be like Twilight, but I wasnt sure. Now after reading this book for the billionth time Im sure its safe to assume I loved it. No expectations is sometimes a really good thing. I bought this book because I was a fan of the Twilight so sue me. Anyway I saw that Stephanie Meyer was coming out with a book called The Host and had to read it. Music: The song I chose this week is Avalon by Bad Religion. Avalon is the island paradise King Arthur was taken after his death. The first part of the song before the chorus kind of seems like the first part of the book where Wanderer goes walking through the desert. Then the second part kind of talks about how everyone was feeling after Wanderer met some of the characters in the cave. The chorus is so perfect because Avalon is mentioned as kind of a paradise which is what the world was made into after the souls came and took the world over. Perfect song for this book. Heres the link to the lyrics: Avalon by Bad Religion Lyrics and this is the link to the video: Avalon by Bad Religion Videos. Review: The Host is a looong book. 619 pages long to be exact. Seriously when I was reading this book even though I couldnt put it down, it took me almost a month to complete. Its long. Filled with description, feelings, inner dialogue, as well as multiple character interactions. The story was never dull, or filled with too much fluff which was great. I feel like the host did an amazing job of depicting the insanity of human emotions. Wanderer is the soul who has taken over human Melanies body, and while even though shes been warned, the human emotions she feels on a day to day basis overwhelm her many times throughout the story. And throughout reading you realize she isnt the only one. This story if a not the traditional love triangle. Im not going to say a lot on it but if you read it youll know what Im talking about. I fell in love with almost every character after the first time I read the book. They all have different personalities, that are so individual its amazing. You know kinda like real life I guess. This story talks about love at in its most true form, and how far people truly are willing to go for the ones they love. Favorite Quote: This quote is one of the main reasons I love this book. I find this quote so true. We value the individual. We probably put too much emphasis on the individual, if it comes right down to it. How many people, in the abstract, would...lets say Paige....how many people would she sacrifice to keep Andy alive? The answer wouldnt make any sense if you were looking at the whole of humanity as equals.
There are many emotions a book can cause. Happiness, anger, relief, curiosity, sadness, etc.. I am always able to tell what a book made me feel, but with this one I cant put it into words. As an aspiring writer I am quite ashamed of admitting that I feel as if every single word I have ever known has left my body right now. Its as if I am not allowed to talk about this book. It was so intimate. Its as if I was told this huge secret and I should not tell anyone a word. But I am going to talk about it. I will try to explain why this book is a masterpiece. Before doing that I want to address the only thing I did not like about this book which has something to do with Donna Tartts writing. I had the same problem with The Goldfinch. She includes many unnecessary descriptions and scenes. Some people might love it. I dont. This book could have been 100 pages shorter if not even more and would still tell the exact same story. I think as a writer you have to see what is important for the story and what not. But since this book was so fantastic I could easily look away from that problem I had. This book is about five very complex college students. Thats all Im going to tell you about the story. You dont need to know more. The characters, the drama and the story evolve around each other in such a sensitive way that it all feels real. You are in the book. Whenever they are all sitting around, there is a chair for you. Whenever they are in a classroom you are sitting at the very back with them. You are in this book and there is no other way I can explain the constant uncomfortable feeling in my chest. This is not a happy story. Its the most messed up, craziest story ever. I have never read, seen or listened to anything like this. I cant put it into words and thats another thing that I love about it. There was so much to think about in this book that I am now left with nothing to say at all. If you would analyze this book in school it would take you more than two years. The conversations, the actions, every little detail was so intriguing. Rereading this book must be even worse. With worse I mean for your nerves not in the sense of it being a bad read. My hands were shaking, my heart was beating too fast, I felt like throwing up and not wanting to leave my bed any longer. I have never been this emotionally attached to a story. Never in such a negative way. Everything I say seems to make no sense, so let me come to this conclusion: Read The Secret History
This book absolutely floored me! How fragile life was, how fragile they were. Love. It was the beginning and the end of everything, the foundation and the ceiling and the air in between. Caution to all of you romantics,, this is NOT a romance novel, or a love story. However, there is so much love wrapped into this book. The love a woman feels for her children, the love a sister feels for her sister, the love a father feels for his daughters, the love of lifelong friends, and yes, the love between a man and a woman. While set in France during WWII, this was also not a book about war. This book was about the women. Particularly the story of two sisters and their very different lives during the occupation of France by the Germans. Men tell stories, I say. It is the truest, simplest answer to his question. Women get on with it. For us it was a shadow war. There were no parades for us when it was over, no medals or mentions in history books. We did what we had to during the war, and when it was over, we picked up the pieces and started our lives over. And this is why the Nightingale had me. Its about these extremely formidable women, who were each up against their own very different challenges. The book begins in the very near past, from the perspective of an older woman who has cancer, and is ready to live out her last days,,, remembering. The reader does not know who the narrator is. Is she carefree Isabelle, or is she her older, more responsible sister Vianne. It created a mystery that lasted until almost the very end. Who was the narrator? These two women were unforgettable. One woman, Vianne, with a husband as a prisoner of war, and with a child to care for, trying to survive the day to day of living during wartime. Standing in never ending queues for scraps of food. Having a German officer billet basically take by force a room in her home in her home, fearful for her life and that of her child everyday, while fighting something forbidden. Isabelle, the much younger, carefree, foolish sister, who is continually kicked out of finishing school after finishing school. Isabelle, who is so daring that she dares to change things for her people, and pays many prices along the way. Both women went through the inexplicable, with unspeakable treatment, as did many of the women and children left behind during wartime. Let us not forget that WWII brought us Hitler and the holocaust, and finally freedom by the Allied soldiers. Some stories dont have happy endings. Even love stories. Maybe especially love stories. Not wanting to spoil anything more about this brilliant, heartbreaking book, I will not say whether or not there is a happy ending. That is to be determined by the reader. I can only say, read the book. You will laugh and cry, but it will all be worth it.
It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did not belong to him. It was never about belonging to someone. It was about being together. What an incredible duology this was. The Rose  The Dagger definitely made me emotional, I mean I want to cry just thinking about a certain thing that happened in the book! The second and final book did take me some time to read BUT that was in no way shape or form because the book was bad... Anytime I picked it up i enjoyed every second of it. The Rose  The Dagger follows Shazis highs and lows as she tries to fight her way back to her love Khalid. You see her struggles as she wants to stay loyal to her family and friends but also on the other hand, she knows the real Khalid and will do anything to break his curse and return to his arms. Shahrzad Shazi: Still, there was no fear. For up here, Shahrzad chased the wind. The ground did not exist. Nor did the sky. Here, she was truely boundless. Fear would never overtake her again. Shazi was AMAZING in this book. Shes such a strong female lead and that makes me so happy! She didnt let people look down on her in this book and got her way if it was the last thing she did. She stood up to certain people and fought for what she wanted. It just made me so proud. One thing I love, is throughout this duology she has always given people second chances, she will listen and hear them out before jumping down their throats. I just have so much love and respect for her as a character and part of me is hoping these get turned into movies because I would LOVE to see that. Khalid: Nothing hurt like missing her. He suspected nothing ever would. Khlaid oh my. Its funny to remember a time when I actually disliked him... Hes just so lovely. I love the lengths he will go to for Shazi and her loved ones. The choices that he makes in this book are mostly all for Shazi... I guess what im trying to say is if you dislike him, give him a chance he will grow on you. Its rare when I enjoy a character the whole way through a book but I really did this time around. As much as I want a third book its clear as to why there wont be one as the ending was perfect and closed off the story as much as it could have been. I just really enjoyed this story and feel like ill definitely reread them in the future!
It is Christmas season in New York, the island where Dash and Lily reside. It is a red moleskin journal peeking out the bookshelves at Strand that starts it all. Dash, described as snarly by most people hes met; and Lily, sweet and sheltered by her doting family attempt to write a story of their own. As words come to play, new romantic entanglements come into foray. With the jingle of bells, two nerdy souls will attempt to discover each other and love; all through the original yet simple task of passing on their book of thoughts and more. Dash  Lilys Book of Dares is a book with its cute name and equally adorable book cover promises to be a light fluffy Christmas read. But it is so much more than that.It is smart, witty and absolutely endearing. The characters are real,nerdy and adorable. Dash is the kind of guy I dare to hope I would one day end up with. Hes smart,witty, interesting, cute,sarcastic,a bit cynical and yes snobbish,but about the right things and underneath it all hes a great person. Being well read and expecting people to have his version of the right taste in music and literature is the kind of snob I can see myself with. Because arent we all just that, when we are making fun of Twilight or the newest Justin Bieber song? He seems so real that his book gives me hope! Screeeeeeeeeech Lily? Well shes the quintessential girl next door. Cute, smart and sweet on the scout for an adventure. At the risk of sounding like an imbecile, I exclaim, THIS BOOK IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Pick this one up and I assure you that you wont regret it and would find yourself relating to it. Funny side characters, great plot and amazing wordplay make the book delectably cute. And as it is my custom, I leave you with a few quotes fromm the book The Insightful It was one of those moments when you feel the future so much that it humbles the present. The important people in our lives leave imprints. They may stay or go in the physical realm, but they are always there in your heart, because they helped form your heart. Theres no getting over that. The Adorable I want to believe there is a somebody out there for me. I want to believe that I exist to be there for that somebody. The Hilarious Ive always resented Hermione, because I wanted to be her so badly and she never seemed to appreciate as much as I thought she should that she got be her. She got to live at Hogwarts and be friends with Harry and kiss Ron, which was supposed to happen to me. Signing off I would like to say that after having suffered form intense withdrawal symptoms of John Green obsession, I must say David Levithan serves as an amazing and easily accessible alternative. And so the Levithan marathon begins!
I wouldnt have read this had it not been a 5star book according to all of my favorite Goodreads friends; the cover does nothing for me and Starrs voice was so different from my own that I would not have been sucked in from the first few pages. Im so thankful for Goodreads, and Im so thankful for my policy of not reading spoilers, watching trailers, or reading the book jackets of books before I jump in. I wasnt expecting the thing that happened, and because of that, I was stunned and horrified and had to pull over and cry this is a review of the audiobook version. It was not easy to put it down after that. I couldnt relate to any part of Starr or any of her loved ones in the book. She had absolutely perfect parents who serve as the ultimate role models to readers. Her teenage relationship is so perfect that I want to claim that its totally unrealistic, but that may just mean that its healthy and outside of my own experiences or that of any of my friends. I want to believe that the relationships in this book are plausibleThomas wrote this well enough that I can believe. Unfortunately, the only characters with whom I could relate were the snotty white kids who gladly protested a cause in which they didnt believe just to get out of class. I remember being really annoyed at the Columbus Day demonstrations because I felt that the protesters voices threatened our day off from school...how shallow I was. : So here was the only place that I saw myself reflected in the book, and yet I still loved it. Ive never encountered a more lovable set of characters, and they all fought and dealt with serious conflict in the most admirable ways. This book was amazing and powerful, and if it were not laden with the fbomb, Im sure it would be required reading in my high school. Readers will be dragged into real world problems and issues in such a way that will cause them to think and evaluate their own character and ideas, and along the way they will be compelled to turn the page and they will be exposed to positive role models, healthy relationships and ways of coping with stress that are in NO way cheesy or preachy. Winwin. I recommend this to those who love YA, to people my age, and to teens RIGHT NOW. Hurry! Unfortunately, it has a short shelf life as the book dates itself irreparably. A year from now may be too late.
Book Review originally published here:  What else can be said about The Screaming Staircase besides that its one of the most impressive books Ive read in my entire life? Jonathan Stroud gives us originality  a fresh concept, a dystopian world haunted by spirits, which can be best seen by children, and which are deadly when they touch you. With ghosts out in the open, Londoners stay inside their homes as soon as night falls, trying to escape the specters lurking down the streets. But even their homes often get plagued by ghosts. Murder victims stay behind to haunt the living. Suicides keep on committing the same act night after night. Lucy Carlyle is a talented young agent who arrives in London hoping for a good career. But instead, she joins the smallest agency in the city, where there are no adults to supervise, and the charismatic Anthony Lockwood, owner of the agency, tends to do things his way. This could go great, or horribly wrong. And like you guessed, it goes horribly wrong. After setting a house on fire during a job that shouldve been relatively easy, Lockwood  Co. is on the verge of bankruptcy. But when a wealthy man shows up on their door with a proposition, they cant say no, even if that proposition sounds a little crazy. Ive seen this book qualified as middle grade; in my opinion, its definitely NOT middle grade. Its suitable for a young adult audience and older. As an adult, I loved it, because its brilliant. Its original, refreshing, the concept is great, the plot is surprising. A young adult would love it  and the main characters are young adults as well. But for middle graders? First of all, its a wopping 404 pages. Secondly, the subject matter is scary, complicated, and not at all suited for middle graders. Even the writing doesnt find that target age group. So Id firmly recommend this one to young adults and older audiences, but not to middle graders. You know by now that I have trouble reviewing books I loved, and I absolutely loved The Screaming Staircase. I cant stress that enough. Everything about this book was brilliant, from the writing which jumped from fun, light humor to dark, gritty atmospheric the next, to the characters, to the amazing plot. If you buy one, and only one book, this year  then buy The Screaming Staircase.
This book.... This damn book. It left me speechless. I dont think I have ever loved a CoHo book more than I do right now. This book was everything to me and it left me feeling a whole bunch of emotions. Once I finished the authors note and acknowledgements, you sure as hell know I was freaking balling my eyes out Im a crybaby. Also, I may have texted everyone in my contacts to go read this book now or we cant be friends anymore. It Ends With Us is a such a strong, powerful, and emotional novel. I cant express enough how much this has changed my outlook and perspective on those who have been abused or just life, in general. I always wondered why women, even men, always stuck with their spouse when they did such horrific things to them. However, now in the eyes of Lily, I could perceive that they did so because they were in love. Viewing the story through Lilys eyes made the book a lot more emotional because whatever she felt, we felt too. Whatever emotion she felt at whatever moment, that was how we felt too. I fell in love with Ryle ever since the moment on the roof. I fell in love with him more and more each time, but Im not going to say much more like others because I want everyone to experience everything on their own. This book is worth it. Also, once you read the book, I would recommend that you read it again because even though you know whats coming next, you have another chance to actually decipher the emotions and dialogue. This is one of the few books that have changed my perspective on certain topics. I will never forget this book and the authors note. That authors note was the end of me. I, as a person and a reader, would like to appreciate and applaud Colleen Hoover for writing this because this mustve been so hard for her, but she did it and I believe this is one of her best books yet. Theres this one quote in the book that will also stick with me forever, but I dont want to explain what it means to me. I want you to interpret it yourself. There is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes do bad things. Once you finish this book, Im warning you that youre going to have a book hangover and trust me, its going to be horrible. Im still going through that process. Now, please excuse me, while I go reread this and ball my eyes out some more.
So, after reading a few reviews on this site, I was kinda bummed. I thought, Great! I bought this and Im going to hate it.. Thankfully, this was NOT the case! I adored it. The first chapter was a bit slow and I thought I wouldnt be able to finish. Im not sure what changed my mind, but once things got going, I couldnt put this book down. I am a lover of fairy tales in general but not so much of futuristic stories tbh. This combo managed to work. A cyborg Cinderella story that takes place in Beijing, the world is plagued by a deadly disease that kills in days. It is wiping out much of the population and there is currently no cure. Cinder our heroine, is a mechanic stuck in a family with her mother and stepsisters. She was brought from Europe by the husband who ultimately was a victim of the plague. The stepmother and sister Pearl blame Cinder and despise her. The other nice sister Peony is a friend to Cinder. After a trip to the junkyard looking for parts to fix something for her mother, Peony becomes ill with the virus and Cinder is blamed. She is sold off by her stepmother for scientific testing and ends up at the palace. The Prince finds her there and begins courting her, unaware that she is a cyborg. There is more to the story, but to keep this spoiler free, I will just say that I loved the plot. I managed to figure out the majority of things before they were revealed, but this didnt take away from the story IMO. It manages to follow the classic Cinderella story but adds a fun, futuristic twist that WORKS. I truly love this book and cant wait for the second book! I found the characters to be welldeveloped. From Iko the android to the lovely Prince Kai, each has their own personality that I found likable. Queen Levana is a great villainess although I would have liked to see a bit more evil from her. Her righthand, Sybil seemed a tad more of the villain type. One of my fave characters would have to be Dr. Erland. Just a jovial man in a society on the verge of an epic wipeout, he is a friend to Cinder when she has no one else. He gives hope for the future. The stepmother was the classic fairy tale case and I couldnt stand her from page one. Cinder herself is a great character. She is intelligent and caring, even if she is part machine. It only adds to her complexity. Then there is Prince Kaito Kai for short... sigh. He is the handsome prince that everyone gets but falls for our glorious and beautiful Cinder. He is a thoughtful, caring, and fair leader. Everything we expect from a fairy tale prince, really and more. Allaround, this is a fantastic start to a series. As well as a great debut novel. I am so happy that I picked this one up. A!
Im going to start this review off by saying its going to be really hard to talk about this book without going into the details because this book is all about those details. Madeline Whittier has a rare disease, Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease SCID, and hasnt ever left her house because of it. She live a routine life, online classes scheduled health check ins every 2 hours, and a lot of reading. The only two people in her life are her mother and her nurse Carla. Madeline is content with her life until a new family moves in next door. Olly becomes Maddys way to explore the outside world. He becomes her first friend friends besides her mom and nurse. Soon,seeing the world through Olly isnt enough. As expected, Maddy wants more and becomes willing to push her previous boundaries to get what she wants. It doesnt help that she has another influence encouraging her to truly live her life. The format makes this book easy and fun to read. If I hadnt gotten sick as I was starting I could have finished this book in 2 or 3 days. There are parts that are told in a traditional novel format but there are other formats incorporated that give the book more life. Some things included are different types of pictures, charts, and schedules. These things add something special to the story so I dont want to talk about anything too specific. I ended up really enjoying the story but not loving it as much as a lot of others seemed to. I thought it was really cute but for a while I thought thats all it would be. Im glad to say I was wrong. Even though she is a little older than characters normally are in YA, Maddy is still naive because she hasnt been able to experience the world, she still has her rebellious moments and thats when everything gets interesting. About 7580 through the book I guessed the climax so that was a bit of a let down but it was still exciting when everything fell into place. I wasnt happy with the way this ended. I get that Maddys emotions would be all over the place and I think she has a right to feel the way she did but I dont like how she expressed those feelings. I guess because I didnt see any signs of a change on Maddys end I just wasnt satisfied. I think this book does an interesting job of showing the love between a family. There is also some insight on different types of families and what it is to have a healthy relationship with your family. I believe this is a realistic contemporary that people should read, especially fans of the genres. I will definitely be reading more from Nicola Yoon in the future.
This is a novel that is impossible to summarize. The plot is episodic and far too long. I will say that the beginning was hilarious. The first hundred pages of the book are comedic genius, with Sancho and Don Quixote getting into one absurd situation after another, with the good knight taking taverns for castles and windmills for giants. But when you keep reading, a subtle change begins in your mind. The lighthearted comedic story turns into a tragedy. By the end of the second book, youre horrified by what happens to the knight. As said by Lionel Trilling, this is a book about the relationship of fiction to truth, a theme echoed in countless novels. It is the story of perfect idealism meeting horrid reality. Don Quixote holds himself to the highest standards of honor, trust, love, charity, and wisdom. As those who meet him continually remark, when Don Quixote speaks of almost any subject, he comes across as learned and sage. The tragedy is that this high idealism is perceived by the world as madness. For me, a great comparison is that of the Don and Captain Ahab. They are both monomaniacal, perhaps insane, and driven by one fantastic goal. For Ahab, its the white whale, for Don Quixote, its Dulcinea del Toboso, the beautiful woman he conjured up from his imagination. Ahabs tragedy is that he has no Sancho Panza, no pull of reality to keep him grounded. Don Quixotes tragedy is that he does have Sancho Panza  that he cannot sail into the great blue yonder, escaping from the constraints of life as it is. In the first book, the knight misinterprets everything, and gets himself continually pummeled. But in the second book, a strange thing happens: the world starts to conform to his visions. The story of his exploits and madness have been spread far and wide, and as a result, the world is transformed. Elaborate hoaxes are played on the knight and squire, in which the tricksters seem just as mad and the tricked. Even Sancho starts believing in wizards and enchantment. Characters start falling for their own deceptions. And the great irony is that, in the end of the story, the only sane person is Don Quixote. He dies peacefully in his bed, while those who tried to cure him of his fantasies now try to restore them. The entire world is turned on its head. Ahab brought down the entire crew of the Pequod in his fall, but he remained true to his purpose; Don Quixotes death was his own, but he abandoned his lifes aim. The world won. Which is more tragic?
Not my screwup. My real. This book was more than just a great read..it was AN EXPERIENCE! I have been sitting here wondering what the magic formula is for an epic book, and the biggest answer that I came up with is: Real has that magic. What made me fall in love with the character of Remington Riptide Tate was from his animal magnetism, his possesiveness, loyalty, agression, vulnerability, and most of all: he was Real! The intensity of this man is off the charts!! What woman would not want a man to look at her as if the sun shines and sets on her, and with every part of his being needs her to be by his side. With every ounce of Remys soul he has found a home within Brooke, and will protect her with every breath in his body. He says it best when he tells her: Protecting you is my privilege. I will protect you and anything that YOU value as if it were mine. Katy Evans has introduced me to a character that I will never forget, and a man that is not only hard to beat in the ring; but as far as Book Beaus go...he is unbeatable as well. The sexual tension in this book was unfreakingbelievable..there are no words as to how worked up I was!! By the time Brooke and Remy did the deed, the butterflies in my stomach were fluttering like crazy, and I swear if a car drove into my house I wouldnt have even noticed. I have never read such and intense sex scene before..EVER!! Katy Evans has such a powerful way with words and I wish I could do her justice by how great I think she is. I was so absorbed into this book, that when it came to the end I wanted to start back at the beginning and read it again! Truthfully, I will miss Remy and Brooke..they are trapped into my heart for good and their story is one that I will treasure for many years to come. This book has touched me in ways that I never thought a book would. My hat goes of to Katy Evans, and I applaud you for writing such a wonderful story. Truly my words dont even do justice to how great it is..but one thing is for sure: Remy and Brooke will live on in my heart for all time!!
The Great Gatsby is considered by many to be the zenith of American fiction writing in the last century. I wont say that it is the best American novel Ive read but I will say it is probably the most perfect. Along with J.D. Salinger, Fitzgerald has got to be my favorite writer of fiction. As opposed to Hemingways bluntness, and Faulkners artiness, Fitzgeralds prose seemsto paraphrase Michael Chabon to rain down from style heaven. His style in fact is like the ladies he writes about: cool, lean and absolutely enchanting. He would never dream of overwriting and knows exactly when to hold back for maximum effect. His use of the language is assured and consequently eminently readable. For that alone this should be considered the Mona Lisa of prose. What is astounding though is how he puts his sparsely elegant style to use giving his characters shade and depth. Fitzgerald is a true student of humanity and his skills of observation are razor sharp. He sums up his characters in sentences that read like aphorisms bulging with truth about the human condition. Theres not a page goes by Im not gasping at the depth of his vision and the economy he uses to express it. So far Ive dwelt on how he wrote and not on what he wrote. People whod back another nag in the Great American Novel derby knock Fitzgeralds sophomoric their word not mine obsession with romance between men and women. They reduce his works to the level of melodramatic tear jerkers. This is a gross simplification of his talents. Yes Gatsby focuses on a doomed love affair but it does so to illustrate the errors in thinking that he felt marred his generation. Gatsby is about the hollowness of the American dream as dreamt in the twenties. Fitzgerald looked around him and in the mirrorand saw men and women locked in a frenzied and ultimatley doomed race for speed, money and sin. Gatsby and Daisys love is doomed because their values have been distorted by money and comfort and opulence. They cannot see the depths because they are too easily distracted by shiny surfaces. When Daisy cries as Gatsby shows off his elegantly tailored shirts because she has never seen clothes so beautiful sums up perfectly how for her exteriors matter most. This is at the heart of the tragedy that unfolds before us in this delicious little novel. There is no denying this is one of the GREAT BOOKS. If you havent read it do so. I dare you to not fall in love with it.
Wow!!! The Diviners has left me reeling, such an intense and engaging book! At first I was a little put off by the amount of pages in this book  almost 600, but I had heard so much buzz about this book that I looked beyond it and just jumped in. Honestly, youll be so drawn into what is happening that at least for me, the pages just seemed to fly. The only other book of Libba Brays that Ive read is Beauty Queens, and I adored that book also, but The Diviners is completely different in genre and style to Beauty Queens which was a reality comedy style book. You can just see from reading this story just how much work and effort has gone into the study of the 1920s, as Libba pours a lot of accurate facts into her work from this time. As someone that loves the flapper era and the 20s I truly appreciated the amount of sheer research she put into telling this story, she did an amazing job as far as that is concerned. The characters themselves were fantastic. I absolutely adored the main character Evie, I thought she was just great. Very outgoing and doesnt take no for an answer which back in the days was frowned upon. She is what you would call a gogetter. Very inquisitive. Sometimes to her own determent for that matter. I felt like the character development was solid, for Evie as well as Memphis, Mabel, Jericho, Will and the background characters like Blind Bill. By the end of the book, I felt like Id been through 2 books worth of a journey with them, and they resonated with me well after the time I finished reading it! The plot itself is just awesome. I love a good murder mystery, and so this was really entertaining. I also thought it was really clever how Libba wrote some chapters although theyre more like scenes really from the perspective of some of the murder victims in their moments leading up to and including the time they encounter death. So well done, and really spiced the story line up even more having read the other side of the tale also. Overall, read this. Im going to say it.... it was my favourite read of 2012. I honestly, truly, really cant think of a bad thing to say about The Diviners. Loved it, and I am looking forward to reading the next book!!
I reviewed this trilogy as a whole, the the review will be the same for all three books! The Hunger Games is the type of trilogy that requires a genre all its own. Its a mold breaker. By far, these books have had more impact on me than anything I have ever read before. The story of Katniss and Peeta and the other district residents is beyond touching and entertaining. Really, there are no words to describe the enormity of what you will find on these pages. Collins amazed me with her ability to drill straight to my heart from the very beginning. You are immediately drawn to the characters, attached to them as if you actually know them, as if your love for them is real. The dystopian world she created for her characters is so believable its scary. Its one of those situations where you think Wow, this could really happen. This could actually be a possible future for us if we are not careful! And that is terrifying. There is so much more than an entertainment value in these books. Theres a message. Theres a warning, and that is just one reason these books will stay with me forever. The events that take place in this story envoke such strong emotions in me. I was completely lost in it. I consumed all three books in as many days, and I felt a terrible loss once they were over. I felt myself wanting to fight for the characters, feeling angry and protective when they were hurt, happy and excited when they were comforted, devastated and heartbroken when some were lost. I cried for them, and laughed with them and even jumped up and down and shouted in triumph. It was definitley an experience I will never forget. I will never forget the Boy with the Bread; the genuine concern and care Peeta feels for Katniss is touching. He would lay down his life for her without a second thought. I will never forget the Girl on Fire; Katniss has the strength and determination of no one I have ever known. She sticks up for what she believes in. She protects the ones she loves no matter the cost. And I will never, ever forget the story of the Hunger Games, the Tributes, the Districts and the battle they partake in to win their freedom and the right to protect their children from a gruesome fate. Five stars are just not enough to represent the perfectness of this story! I highly, highly recommend this trilogy to everyone from YA to adult. I think it has an important message for everyone and is an unbelievably beautiful read that I wish I could experience over and over again for the first time. See more of my reviews on my blog: 
Divergent kicks off a new dystopian trilogy by debut author Veronica Roth. Bookstore shelves are bursting with dystopian books that are all trying to be the next Hunger Games. Divergent comes the closest yet to capturing the pulse pounding excitement of THG. The fast paced and suspenseful Divergent is the real deal. Sixteenyearold Beatrice lives in dystopian Chicago where society is divided up into five factions that best represents their character. The five factions are Abnegation selflessness, Candor honesty, Amity peaceful, Dauntless bravery, and Erudite intelligence. Every year sixteenyearolds are evaluated to identify the faction that they are best suited for. Following the evaluation, a ceremony is held where the teens formally choose the faction that will define their lives. Beatrices evaluation is inconclusive, so she has a tougher time making her choice. Once she decides, the initiation phase begins. She must compete against other initiates in grueling combat and mental exercises to fight for a spot in her chosen faction. Beatrice now called Tris enters into the competition of her life, where it is unclear who she can trust. Shes got secrets of her own to keep including a love interest in this high stakes tournament. If you like books jam packed with action, this ones for you. The suspense is relentless with danger around every corner. The majority of the book takes place in the initiation phase. This is a series of highly competitive battles where the initiates are scored and ranked accordingly. The faction leaders demand the best and have eyes everywhere. Betrayal, backstabbing and cruelty are the name of the game. Meanwhile, outside the initiations there is a political power struggle brewing between the factions that threaten the status quo. Tris is a refreshing and complex heroine who evolves throughout the novel. She faces challenge after challenge with surprising results. Shes smart, and tough as nails, and has something to prove. Overall shes a badass character who is fun to watch. Her love interest is also tough, smart and mysterious. He is not looking to change her, and is attracted to her strength and power. There is never a dull moment in this book, and I could not put it down. Divergent is paced well, and has good world building and food for thought. I liked the Chicago setting, and the descriptive writing and details helped me to visualize the scenes well. I definitely imagined it as a movie while I was reading it, and in fact Summit has bought the film rights. The ending is a little abrupt, but was satisfying overall. This book is a chilling and heart pounding suspense thriller that had me on the edge of my seat. I cant wait to read the sequel, which should be out in 2012. Hunger Games fans; this is the book for you.
You only really fall apart in front of the people you know can piece you back together. Its been quite a while since Ive picked up a Sarah Dessen book and ever since I saw this book going around the book community, I was intrigued. I mean a carousel in the cover??? I love anything and everything circuscarnivaly so seeing a ride on the cover had me sold. Dont get me wrong, the carousel does make an appearance but if you didnt already know, this is not a circusy book. And I liked it anyway. This story captivated me enough that it made me forget real life. I read it in one sitting. The characters were realistic to me, especially Mac. Hes so sweet and I loved seeing him interacting with out main character. Hes respectful, protective, thoughtful, smart, and dependable. He always made me smile when he did things for those he loves. His sister, Layla, was also a wave of fresh air. Shes the best friend we all aspire to have. Shes protective and loyal, exactly what Sydney needed. Our main character, Sydney, has to navigate life as the sister of a prisoner in jail. This tremendous weight dropped upon her and her family had a lot to do with her feeling invisible her entire life. This book follows her journey as she finds her selfworth and meets people who saw it before her. I actually felt her struggle and I was incredibly scared for her when it came to a particular male character invading her space. Because of that sketchy character,my stomach kept twisting painfully. I was scared to reach the point of no return while at the same time wanting to devour every word as fast as I could. I really wished she wouldve spoken up more but all character developments arent the same and I was proud of her by the end anyway. Also, I really didnt enjoy her parents at all, until the very end, of course. I loved that this book didnt include instalove or love triangles. I mean I love triangles but I know that wouldnt have fit anywhere with this plot line. The pacing was perfect and I was invested in Sydneys growth. The reason why I didnt give this 5 stars was because of one reason and one reason only. The ENTIRE book I was waiting for ONE thing to happen and it so happened to be our little cliffhanger. Ugh!!!! I was not amused and I couldnt get past it. I need an extra chapter or something in order to give this one more star. All in all, I enjoyed it a lot.
Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.  John Green , The Fault in Our Stars. Look what just happened. John Green knew how this book would make me feel and so he already wrote this line in the book. Is it just me or Goodreads is showing only five stars? Im writing this review long after Ive read the book. I remember the night I finished it, there were satisfaction and pleasure. Grief and pain. Magic. What is wrong with John Green exactly? Is he just being made up of awesome or something else? Must be something mysterious Im not used to. I had been waiting for this book ever since it came out, having seen John Greens fans here and there on facebook, I thought about reading one of his book. But, alas, I neither could get the hardcopy nor an ebook. Suddenly one of my friends on facebook told me about this amazing book she was reading and gave me it. I was literally dying to read it. It was a busy week and I remember being in bed at 4 am with tired eyes and having this splendid journey with Hazel Grace Lancaster. A cancer stricken teenaged girl, for all I knew, her life definitely wasnt going to be easy. Unlike some fantasy stories, I could totally connect to Hazel, how being sick affected her and her parents life, how being reminded of her unavoidable sickness raged her. I felt distinct emotions through the words. Felt emotions I didnt know I was saving inside. Beautiful. About the characters, Hazel is a brainy sixteen year old girl with cancer, who knows she has only a few days and she decides to be happy than morose. She finds her true love in Augustus Waters. Gus, who once had a cancer but still holds a cigarette to his lips than smoke it, his way to mock his disease. Gus,who gave Hazel forever within her numbered days. Yes,Gus, you did. One more major thing about this novel. Peter Van Houton. John Green has very trickily written it basing on ANOTHER authors novel, An Imperial Affliction, if you just let me blow your mind, both the author and his novel are imaginary, fictitious. Come to think of it, how much do you have to be skilled to write a novel influenced by ANOTHER guys novel and feed the insides and outsides of both stories to the reader? And still be awesome? Yes, that is John Green with whom something is definitely and so fortunately wrong. This novel is consisted of wonderful words. Id like to state a few: My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. The marks humans leave are too often scars. Grief does not change you, Hazel.It reveals you. The world is not a wishgranting factory. As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. I hope you love the book as much as I do. Or more.
I continued my read along with TLCReadAlong by reading Cress in about 4 days. It was so good! I absolutely love this series. I cant wait to read Fairest hopefully this weekend, in anticipation for Winters release on Tuesday! I gave Cress 5 out of 5 stars. In this book, its pretty much the same set of main characters, with the addition of Cress. And I thought she was absolutely adorable. Its been a couple months since I read the first book, so my memory was a bit hazy when they introduced her. Thankfully the book explained pretty early on who she was. The book was pretty fastpaced, despite being fairly long. A 550 page book would probably usually take me over a week to read, but I couldnt put it down. I think the series does get better with each book. Cress is probably my favorite so far, and Im hoping Winter is just as good, if not better. I was absolutely riveted as I read. I love all the pairings in the book. I still want all the main male characters to be my book boyfriends. Theyre all amazing in their own ways. And I want to be friends with all the female characters. Really, I just want to live in this amazing world that Marissa Meyer has built for her fans. The whole series is based on fairy tale retellings. In this book were supposed to see some of the Rapunzel fairy tale. We do see elements: the long hair, and Cress being locked away from everyone. It wasnt as strong on the retelling aspect as some of the previous books as far as I can tell, or maybe I just dont know the true Rapunzel fairy tale well enough. I did mark down two lines from the book: He was exactly the kind of hero Cress had been dreaming about her entire life. and You were so certain that I was this other person, and I kind of liked that you saw me differently than anyone else. Part of me kept thinking that maybe youve been right all along, and its everyone else whos been wrong about me. That even Ive been wrong about me. But for the most part I was so absorbed that I didnt even think about my favorite lines. I especially love the last couple chapters of Cress, and I really cant wait for Winter to come out. I want to know what happens next! Final note: An amazing third book to the series! I am so excited for Winter to come out next week! Check out the series if you havent already. Im positive you wont regret it!
I am speechless and dont know where to start...this book has touched me deeply... I dont agree with some of the ideas, but it is beautifully written... Full of different genuine emotions... reading and the mountains echoed, I cant describe the emotional roller coaster I was in..Cant describe how I lived with every character in the book, with their disappointments, their fear, their feelings of joy and sadness... This novel is so different from what Alhosseini has written before and the reason behind that to me is that its natural for every writer to try different writing techniques, as doing that keeps hisher writing style appealing and powerful. I liked that the novel in some parts of it voiced the real concerns of Afghans outside their country, mentioning how going back to your original country after such a long time makes you realize how things differ from place to place. It makes you aware of the challenges of finding your true identity and trying to find your real self in the middle of any emotional turmoil you go through. We all sometimes have an identity crisis and get stuck in a dilemma of choosing between things we have known before in the past or things we experience in the future. In the end, its how we choose the best of either experiences or just simply be humane.. There were many stories, all linked together in some way, causing you to just wonder what happens next..Then everything unfolds smoothly. Every chapter is a story on its own, making you live so deeply with its characters... I loved it honestly...I wanted to finish it to know what happens, but at the same time, I didnt want a book like this to end, the way I feel about many other books I like.. Also, the narrative technique was good, but there were some gaps I feel, like some chapters could have been longer and some shorter....I feel Marcoss chapter was unnecessarily long and the main characters like Abdullah didnt get much of the attention.. It was a bit disturbing that when you were already living with a certain story, suddenly it ends and you have to familiarize yourself with another story and character... I guess though that this is a kind of style used by many writers..In the end, Khaled is a talented writer I must say! : and I appreciate talent a lot....He has a good imagination, painting pictures of other lands, cultures... I liked that : I only feel Pari and Abdullahs story could have been a bit longer, considering the fact that they were the initial characters in the novel, and the most we were familiar to.
I know, I know. Im extremely late to this series. I had actually meant to start it a long time ago, I just always tended to find something else. Now that I have read the first book though, I am wondering why I had ever decided to pass on it so many times. City of Bones was deeply engrossing, I loved the extremely rich atmosphere of the scenessettings. The dark vibe was also really fun, it added a great layer to the story. I was somewhat afraid that it would be more toned down, but I was really impressed with how dark some of it actually was. I had a minor issue with the story, it starts out really great though. Early on you start learning a lot about the characters, and the different situations going on but towards the middle of the book I felt like Cassandra just added some filler scenes that I dont really feel was needed. There was nothing really specific that comes to mind, I just remember getting bored at certain parts because I felt like a scene was just tossed in for the sake of it and really didnt have any role in the story. Most of those scenes were good though, just wish the flow of the story would of went a little better in the middle of the book. Luckily things really seemed to get back on track towards the end, some of the major plot lines were picked back up and I was able to get several of the answers I was wanting. Im not going to go into a huge discussion on the characters, as I feel like talking to deeply about it could ruin the feel of this book and I want people to enjoy it. I will say though that Cassandra did an amazing job creating her characters. Both the good and bad ones where written very well, and I found myself really wanting to know their stories and how they came to be in certain situations. I feel like things are really going to pick up in the character department in book two though, especially after some of the bombshells at the end. I am excited to see what happens to them all, and to meet any new characters there might be. The ending was fantastic, it left you with a thirst for the next book but I didnt really see it as much of a cliffhanger or anything. Luckily it will be easy just to pick up book two and not have to worry about any of that, I guess that is one of the awesome benefits of waiting so long to start a series because most of the books in the series are already out. I cant wait to read the rest of this series though, I plan to pick up a copy of book two soon and just really look forward to jumping back into this insanely rich world that Cassandra has created. If youre like I was, and havent started this series yet I would highly recommend adding it to your summer reading list. It would be an awesome use of time.
Cassandra Clare is brilliant with words. I just want to see her sentences placed everywhere. Every single time I read one of her books I am reminded once again that Cassandra Clare is one of the Queens of YA for a reason. She has tact for detail that is unlike any other, and in Lady Midnight I was swept away by the shadow world once again. Id just like to point out that, I know I sound calm, but I am in no way calm about this book. I have patiently not really waited for this book for YEARS. And now here I am, done with the book, and its honestly taking everything in me not to cry about the fact that I have to wait another year or two for a book that I would sell my college education for so basically my future. My heart was broken and mended in ways that only Cassandra is capable of doing. However, as I sit here typing this, I can truly admit that I am beyond satisfied with Lady Midnight. New characters sometimes make me a bit nervous, but it was so easy to love these characters right from the start. We are introduced to incredibly fierce Emma, who encompasses everything I love about a MC. If you dont love Emma, Im not sure we could be friend, honestly. Julian is just...WOW. Cassandra knows how to create her men. Julian basically has to raise all of his siblings, and you see just how much responsibility he has placed on his shoulders. He might be a 17yearold guy, but hes dealing with things that parents would be dealing with. The Blackthorn family is one for the books people; they are a quirky, amazing, and loving group. They all seem to have each others backs, and its a very big part of the book! I know I was laughing throughout a lot of their interactions with each other. One thing that I not only want to point out, but applaud Cassandra Clare for, was how she included REAL issues, and problems that people deal with. Yes, this is a fictional book, but she made sure to intertwine current issues. Such as weight, family issues, relationships, and autism. What a breathe of fresh air this book was! I cant think more highly of Cassandra, plus she definitely had some awesome references to women. For Example: Women are fiercer by far then men. LOVE IT. The plot in this book was well thought out, and you will pretty much be unable to put it down. So fair warning: If you start this book at 9 at night...you will be up until 6 in the morning read. Now, because I love Cassandra Clare quotes so much Ill give you my favorite one from this book: Youre walking the edge of a razor blade, Julian, with everything you hide. Believe me. Ive walked that razor blade half my life. You get used to it, so used to it sometimes you forget that youre bleeding. BAM. I dont know how Ill be able to wait for the next book, but Godspeed to us all. Stay Drunk on Books, Steph 
Book: Six of Crows Author: Leigh Bardugo Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars So, I was kind of pressured into this reading this book. I have been hearing many whispers about Six of Crows, but never actually thought about reading it. The more I looked at it, the more I thought that I will just get it from the library and give it a try. Well, that didnt work out. I sucked it up and paid the twenty bucks to buy it. Glad I did! Leigh has this writing style that really is not like anything that I have ever read. The plot is very, very focused and the characters are so well rounded that I just dont know what to say. I was worried about the fact that the plot did focus on one job and that job did take up most of the book, but the pacing was really, really good. I loved the atmosphere and the mystery that surrounded the characters. It had an old, but, yet, modern feeling to it. There was just something about that is very, very luring. Okay, think of it in terms of Harry Potter. Why did we sit there and read all of those books? Why? Because there is this little, tiny spark that pulls you in and you just cannot get away from it. Action, well, yeah there is a lot of it. However, it does not feel like I am reading the same thing over and over and over. Each event, each sequence is unique to that scene. Plus, Leigh is the mistress of putting cliffhangers in all the right places and leaving you turning page after page after page. Plus, she left plot holes in some places that were fulfilled in another spot. Yeah, you have to actually read all of the pages to get the full story. With this being a young adult, there is some romance. Six characters...Yeah, three couples. I will say this to all of you love triangle haters. NO LOVE TRIANGLE! The couples are very, very linear and show no interest of moving out of their group. So, do you have to read the Grisha books before reading Six of Crow? No, I didnt and I havent yet. I do think that I am going to order them and give them a try. There are a few words the Grisha books, but I didnt feel like I was missing out on anything. I will warn you that the first fifty or so pages are really hard to get hooked into. At first I thought that I was making a mistake by buying the book, but things did get a lot better. This is a series to watch. I cannot wait for book two!
5 full stars!!! I honestly wish I could give more because this book totally deserves it. :D The plot of the book is as follows. We start of in the year 2575 where two mega corporations are at war over a small colony called Kerenza which mines a substance called Hermium. Suddenly, an invasion takes place when one of the corporations starts attacking the settlement. Kady and her exboyfriend Ezra find themselves scrambling to make their way to an evacuation vehicle. Before they know it, they are hurtling through space with an enemy warship on their tail. However, this is not their only problem, a deadly virus seems to be attacking personnel on board the ship while the AI that is supposed to protect them might be turning against them. As Kady hacks through the ships systems, she stumbles across secrets and lies. Will she and Ezra make it out alive? First, I thought the worldbuilding was phenomenal. The layout of this novel was so unique and creative. I cant even wrap my head around how schematics, IM messages and surveillance footage write ups created such a complex storyline and plot. It was definitely something new and refreshing. But everything was just solid. Yes, there is a fair bit of computer jargon and some defense terms, but thats what differentiates this book from others. I really commend the authors for taking time to research this stuff. It lent an air of authenticity to the book. Second, the characters are FLAWLESS. Kady is spunky and so badass. I love her hacking and computer witchery skills. While Ezra is so sweet and a very dependable kind of guy. There are total opposites but it really works for them. I loved their banter and interactions. Plus, they were so brave and their love for each other is so transcendent. Gosh! I was just rooting for them all the way. I also LOVED AIDAN. Yes, he is an evil AI computer. But, his personality was so layered. I mean his reasons for doing things at the end of the day could be forgiven. I can totally see why he did it. Fourth, I loved the pacing. It was action all the way. The story flows seamlessly. There are twists and turns which will leave you reeling. Plus, I loved how the horror element was blended into the story. That was so EPIC. It just took the book to another level. I also loved how there is a mix of space espionage, mystery, murder, deception and a touch of romance. You get like bits of everything. So you are never really bored out of your mind. Anyway, I loved this book. If you havent read it. You should. Gosh! I need book two like right NOW!!! This one is going to my all time favourites shelf :D
No spoilers included.  The writer was saying that in return for full bellies and entertainment, his people had given up their political responsibilities and therefore their power. There is one word that sums up this installment. Epic. Okay, maybe two or three...mindblowingly epic. The strangest thing is I really struggled with the first part of this installment. Not because I wasnt invested in the characters or the story, but because I was so anxious to find out what exactly was happening, what was going on. And much of the first half felt like there was a lot of strategy talk, politicsall necessary, of course, but it dragged for me. Then, all of a sudden, things started taking shape and I felt that same passion Ive had for the characters fates since the beginning of the series consume me again. I wanted to fight for them. And from there on out, it was a roller coaster ride. I ached for Peeta and Gale and felt for Katniss on so many levels. One thing that really stuck out for me is that not only is Katniss this kickass YA heroine that we dont see very oftenintellectual, super smart, brave, tough, realbut shes also so honest with herself about who she is. Even though she doesnt have it all figured out, she knows when she is being selfish, can admit her motives, or at the very least questions them. Shes logical and to the point but has a good heart, too. Shes just fantastic in my book, even with her obvious flaws. There is only so much I can say without spoiling anything, so I will just say this: Aside from the heartracing events, fantastic character development, and overall phenomenal storytelling, I am most moved by the undercurrents here. The messages about consumerism and power and greed. All of it is so brilliant and so touching; I sincerely wish more YA authors would explore these themes. This entire series has real heart, offers valid concerns that should and will make you think, and plenty of action, romance, and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You know youve read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.Paul Sweeney This is how I felt when I read the last line of the book. Peeta, Gale, Katniss, and the whole clan will be missed. Thank God I can revisit them whenever I like, but it will never compare to the first, original journey.
What a strange little book. I understand that its highly regarded and received the Printz Award for excellence in the genre of ya. Some of the technical aspects of the book, namely the style in which it was written, are actually well done and I quite liked it. But on the whole, this is one of those books that leave you with more questions than answers. I liked the journal style of the bookthe free flow of thoughts and disregard of sentence structure and punctuation. Each paragraph consists of one, long runon sentence. However, its readable and it captures the nature and voice of the narrator, Daisy, rather well. And I suppose you can even see Daisys writing style as a metaphor for the war taking place in the story... the breakup of structure and order, replaced by disorder and chaos. Yet, the book fails to explain whats really going on here. Theres no context. When does this story take place? Is it the present, the future? Who are these terrorists? All we know is that they are the enemy and the occupiers. But why is this occurring? And why are there also attacks in the U.S.? Is it the same enemy? Its never made clear. Daisy later states that the occupation lasted for only a few months, yet the repercussions seem to be long lasting. After six years, England is still in the midst of recovery. And why are there still snipers in NYC? Are the snipers the enemy or are they defense? Again, its not clarified. I suppose the authors trying to make this story a personal account, focusing on how the war is affecting this girl, how she manages to survive and how she lives now taking each day at a time, rather than provide a generalized account, with heavy detailed political descriptions of the events. But that also just seems to be an easy way out. I also didnt quite like how the author handles the graphic elements of the story. She never gives the reader any preparation for these moments; they arrive rather suddenly and abruptly. Its a shock to the system. For instance, consider the scene describing the shooting of that boy in the truck. Quite a lot of these sudden moments pop up in the story, but I found that they lost some of their significance. Instead of depicting the gravity and horror of the situation at handthis warit just becomes scenes added for shock value. As the book stands, its fine, but I expected something better... something excellent that deserved to be merited the Printz.
When my friend told me about this book a year ago, I said, Is it fiction? I thought her name was Helen Lane. That was the name I remembered from both my cell biology textbook and my immunology lab class, where we learned to make hybridomas using HeLa cells. They said the cell line originally came from a woman whod had cervical cancer, but there was no other info about her. Not surprising, patient privacy and all. I imagined that shed knowingly donated them to science. Turns out thats not quite the case. This book isnt fiction, but there were moments so sad, I wished it were. The donors name was indeed Henrietta Lacks, the Helen Lane attribution having been an attempt to protect her identity. There was no such thing as informed consent back when the samples were taken and neither she nor her family got any notice of the successes that scientists had with her cells though much of that was after she died or any compensation. Because her name was kept under wraps, it was many years before her family heard about the HeLa cell line at all. When they were finally contacted, they were confused, frightened, and felt very much wronged. One of the doctors said of Lacks: From a clinical point of view, Mrs. Lacks never did well. ... As Charles Dickens said at the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities, It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. But it was the best of times for science in that this very particular tumor gave rise to the HeLa cell line. ... For Mrs. Lacks and the family she left behind, it was the worst of times. Scientific progress and indeed progress of all kinds is often made at great cost, such as the sacrifice made by Henrietta Lacks. I wont give anything away, but the science lore in the book runs the gamut from inspiring to fascinating to horrifying. The stories of Henrietta and her children are heartbreaking, though there are some moments of hope, too. I came away feeling grateful to Skloot for writing this book and sharing the real story not only with the public, but with Lackss family. It cant possibly make up for all they endured, but perhaps it could bring them some peace. Theres now a foundation in place, funded in part by proceeds from the book, to help the Lacks descendents and others that were or are descended from uncompensated research subjects. I hope it does well for them.
I have included gobs of this book in status updates and other quotes so will probably not do my usual inclusion of material from the text within this review. But let me say first that I was immediately captivated by this book and soon adopted the feeling of some other reviewers that everyone should read and take this book to heart. I had the ebook from my local online library source but soon found that I had purchased two hardback copies with the idea of distributing them to people whom I could not imagine should miss the chance to read it! I will give one copy to my daughter who is in her last semester at the University of Virginia and seemed familiar with books notion that black men are being rounded up left and right by the popular War on Drugs and imprisoned. That she had come to this conclusion in Charlottesville, Virginia, gave me some hope that her academic years had not been for naught. The title of the book really says it all: The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness. I am exactly the right audience for this book as the author notes in the Preface: This book is not for everyone. I have a specific audience in mind people who care deeply about racial justice but who, for any number of reasons, do not yet appreciate the magnitude of the crisis faced by communities of color as a result of mass incarceration. In the Foreword, radical Cornel West exhorts us: Martin Luther King Jr. called for us to be lovestruck with each other, not colorblind toward each other. To be lovestruck is to care, to have deep compassion, and to be concerned for each and every individual, including the poor and vulnerable. The social movement fanned and fueled by this historic book is a democratic awakening that says we do care, that the racial caste system must be dismantled, that we need a revolution in our warped priorities, a transfer of power from oligarchs to the people and that we are willing to live and die to make it so! This is a book that exhorts! It takes an idea and gathers enough specifics so that you can run with the idea on your own. You can become an advocate. But you must be prepared to be challenged. You will not be allowed to rest on your good liberal duff. You will want to DO SOMETHING after you read this book. For that, it gets five stars! Agitate! Educate! Organize! And here is a great thing: Since you are reading this on Goodreads, you can preview the book right here! Even listen to some of it! So, get to it!
WOW WOW WOW 4.5 This book starts out with an action packed beginning, and it does not stop. I found this book to be so gripping intense. The book started out a little slow because of the build up of the world and characters, but as I progressed, I didnt want to put it down. The drives into gritty and raw topics that we have to seriously question if we were ever in an apocalypse world. What would we eat? What if there were no animals to eat? This book drives into topics like Cannibalism, which is something that I think YA doesnt touch on. In an dystopian society, where is our food coming from? There isnt much of it left without factories, so would you consider eating other people? These are raw topics that we dont want to think about in the world we live in, but are things that we would have to answer to when we not ate much of anything in weeks. It also dives into things like loss and what happens to the mentally ill when there are no medications to take care of their illnesses. These are things that I think are extremely important in the genre, and especially important to note in Young Adult literature. Each of these characters came to life in their own unique ways. Penryn is such a strong characters, and in the world that she is in, that is a necessity to survive. She continues to take another step forward to save her sister, even though she could die at any point. Her mother is so unique and twisted. She shows a darkness that is not usually represented in the YA genre. She added the another dark element that shows demons that people live with when having people like her in their lives. People like these characters exist. They are terrible but real. I liked how the world builded. I enjoyed how the story was a slow burn. There were times when I wanted more information about the world, but I appreciated the lack of info dumps more than my desire for knowledge. The only things that really lacked for me were how some of the actions scenes felt quite short. They seemed like they were done in no time, and they sometimes left me confused because of this. The other thing that didnt really work for me as a reader was the agnostic angel. I appreciated the authors attempt at diversity in religion, but with angel I just didnt understand it. It didnt really flow for me and felt a little forced.
As seen on The Quiet Concert Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda was a breath of fresh air and not only for the LGBT genre, but for the contemporary and young adult genre as well. It was incredibly charming without even trying to be and unassuming in the best kind of way. I absolutely adored how Simon and Blues relationship unfolded and finished this book with a big smile on my face. Really, I adored everything about this book. Simon is gay but no one knows yet. Its not that hes ashamed of it or thinks that his family and friends will care, he simply doesnt want things to change and had no reason to come out yet. But then he meets and falls in love with a boy on the internet, a boy that goes by the name of Blue and happens to attend his school, and is blackmailed about it by a fellow student. This book follows the progression of these two events which eventually leads to Simon coming out, him establishing a new norm, and Simon and Blue living HEA. : The relationships in this book were realistically portrayed and ultimately uplifting. These characters were human  they did some things right and some things wrong but they were honest and apologetic and forgiving and so extremely likable. There was a lot of growth and learning, not just on Simons end but among the secondary characters as well, which I thought was great. Simon has a great support system around him. But now for the heart of the book  SIMON AND BLUE! Simon and Blue may make the most adorable couple ever. I loved their email exchanges and how honest they were with each other except for the whole identity thing. I loved their flirtations and how their conversations slowly turned more serious. I loved when they finally met. It was so ridiculously perfect I cant even. And then they were so cute together in real life, it just made me sick, happy sick. They are the best. I went into this book with really high expectations and Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda exceeded all of them. It was just happiness embodied except when I wanted to wring Martins neck. If you are wondering whether or not you should read this book, the answer is yes, yes you should. Now excuse me while I go eat some oreos.
 spoiler alert  Okay, okay, okay, okay. After three long years I can finally review this book and oh my god. I havent been uptodate with Cassies posts, but my expectations for the characters were just a little different from reality. For one, I had thought Emma was the one who knew she was in love with Julian, and dated others to try to fall out of love. I also thought that Julian was not completely aware of his feelings, though the fact that he did was so much better. And Cristina. I had expected her to be friends with Emma for longer than two months; I had thought theyve been best friends for at least a couple years. But even with all these expectations from snippets Cassie gave us throughout the years, Lady Midnight was spectacular. I love that we got to see the aftermath of the Dark War in the book. I remember being surprised that Emma and the Blackthorns were so heavily involved in The City of Heavenly Fire because I hadnt even thought that they were to be part of that story, but I love that they were. We get to see not just Julian, but everyone else, change from the Dark War and how that affected them. Julian needed to grow up way too fast and I loved the juxtaposition from the young Julian in CoHF and the more responsible one in TDA. Tormenting, of course, but it was still great. Truthfully, I was a bit scared of Kieran and maybe even Mark. I never really trusted Kieran, even when he revealed Malcom and Iarlath. He could speak no untruths, but I still doubted him. I was surprised with the whole ordeal with Malcom. At first, I thought it was a trap, because even if they had been searching for a good part of the book I figured that pointing Malcom as the murderer was too easy. I thought thered be more, but he admitted it pretty easily. It was a little bothersome to see him play through the whole IlltellyoumyentireplanbecauseIneedanaudience act, which I guess had to be done to explain how everything worked. Finding out what happened to Emmas parents in the first book was unexpected, because I had thought that it would play across the entire trilogy, and we would get the answers in the last book. Though I keep feeling that we might revisit that in later books. Since TDA is obviously a continuation to both TID and TMI as well as the rest of the Shadowhunter Chronicles, Emma and other narrators often needed explain how the the world worked. While necessary, I wished Cassie had done it in another way since it feel too tellnotshow to me, and just a bit bland. Overall, I loved that we got to see the aftermath of the Dark War in the long run for the Blackthorns, revisits from characters all across the Shadowhunter world. Im a little disappointed with how fast the conflict seemed to be resolved, though we are sure to see how this comes up again in the later novels. Rating: 4.5
Huge thanks to St. Martins Press for sending me this book to read and review. Emma In The Night is available to buy on August 8, 2017 WOW... this book blew me away. Collecting my thoughts to put together a review is going to be a large task in itself because I am still sitting here in shock of all the turns that this book took. I am not one to hand out star reviews lightly but when I say this book is five stars, it is five stars. I was completely enthralled and swept away in this bizarre story and could not stop reading until all the secrets were revealed. This was my first book to read by Wendy Walker and I can safely say it will not be my last. If you have this book added to your reading pile than go to that said reading pile and put it on the very top, you will not be disappointed! Emma and Cass are sisters. Sisters that have gone missing and after three years only one of them has returned home. Cass  the sister to return home is on a mission. She weaves a story about essentially being held against their will on an island for the last three years. You arent sure if you can fully trust what Cass is saying or any other member of that family but you do know one thing, Emma is still missing and Cass is determined to point the police in the direction to find her sister. Forensic psychiatrist Abby Winter worked on the case when the girls first went missing and she is pulled back in at Casss return. She knows all to well the horrors that went on inside Cass and Emmas household before they disappeared and she has not been able to ever shake the fact that she could have done more to find them. Abby uncovered that their family was beyond dysfunctional. Their mother in Abbys opinion has narcissistic personality disorder. Her jealousy and manipulation not only violated boundaries but could have something to do with the girls disappearance. Now sitting in the same room with Cass and hearing her story she cannot help but wonder why she has this nagging feeling that Cass is hiding something. This book is full of so many jaw dropping moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the absolute end. My recommendation is to run not walk to the book store and immediately start reading Emma In The Night!
The Darkest Minds was a roller coaster experience, sometimes it YAY happy times and exploring the next thing is BAM and you start screaming. Alexandras world building is amazing and it felt so real, its the first book that I have read that takes place in the current time with a twist, and I love it. I really enjoyed this book and has so many notes and quotes that I want to share. The darkest minds tend to hide behind the most unlikely faces Once I had tapped into the vein of doubts, the rest came flooding in Ruby as a protagonist was awesome and her character and behavior was so real. That you can relate to her pain and how she is so scared to use her powers or declare them because she just want to be normal and treated that way, and not as a freak. It really made me cry when her parents didnt recognize her on her birthday, I dont want to imagine this happening it will break my heart so. I loved how she started to pull herself together and fought so hard to be accepted in the team of Liam, chubs and Su. The part where she saved them from Lady Jean was really awesome, and when Liam said that they wanted her was so cute and full of fluff. The romance in the book felt so real but predictable, but I liked that Alexandra didnt mention how hot Liam was at the beginning of the book like other YAs and focused more on the character and conversation which made me love this couple so much as it felt nice and enjoyable and their conversations were so full adorable things. Another thing that I really loved was how Alexandra brought all those book references in the whole plot that really connected with the current reality that they were in. The killing part where insanely freaky and they were awesome and scary. Also, I loved the fact that when they were solving the clue of how to get to camp East River, as well, how book reviews was used for communications such a super cool way to communicate! Surprisingly, The Darkest Minds reminded me of Shatter Me series which was really weird and I didnt like. Yes, I know it is different in so many ways, but come on. Juliet broke free and met Adam, who saved her from Warner, Warner is the son of the commander? Sound familiar? This book is fantastic and I enjoyed it so much, totally recommend it to people who love the dystopian genre. My feelings after reading this book?
Clockwork Princess is the third and final installment in The Infernal Devices trilogy by the incomparable Cassandra Clare. I was terrified to read this book, I wont lie. I bought it the moment it released and then started it and put it down, so very afraid of what was going to happen to my beloved Tessa, Will and Jem. I wanted to know what happened yes but I didnt want it to be over. I did not want to say goodbye. So I shelved it. Im a wimp, I own it. However, after my recent visit to Oblong Books  Music where I got to hear Cassie speak  get a picture with her and Holly Black yay!, I found I was unable to put it off any longer. I put on my big girl panties and started the book again. The story picks up not long after Clockwork Prince ended and dives right back into the action. I have to say, I was so happy that this book was so long. My hardcover copy was over 500 pagesI LOVE big books. Love them. And I felt Clare really tied all the necessary threads off to satisfactorily wind up her trilogy. I honestly dont know how to review this book without gushing and screaming in both happiness and heartbreak. There is just so much to scream about. And we dont do spoilers here and I would never want to be responsible for ruining someone elses reading experience. I will say thisall of you authors attempting to write love triangles, you should all be taking notes from Cassandra Clare. Here, finally, we have a TRUE triangle. Three people who all truly love one anothernot in a weird, kinky way but real, deep, abiding, lasting, timeless love. Both romantic love and the love between friends andor brothers, it leaps off the pages. Who should Tessa choose? No matter what happens, someones heart will be broken, they could all potentially wind up alone and shattered inside. Reading this book was a bit of a traumatic experience if Im being honest. I couldnt stop once Id started again. I had to know what would happen and how things would fall in the end. It was beautiful and brilliant and I know Im gushing, Im sorry but I am sincere in saying that I dont think I will ever love a series or the characters therein as much as I have these ones. They have left their marks on my soul and I see many rereads in my future.
4.5 stars Ill be the first to admit that, while I have enjoyed Colleen Hoovers work in the past, the last few books havent quite hit the mark for me. Not in the same way as her earlier ones. Some were better than others for sure, but they were lacking that magic I experienced with HOPELESS and SLAMMED. I picked up IT ENDS WITH US expecting more of that, and boy, was I wrong! The blurb couldnt have prepared me for the emotional onslaught these pages packed. And then all of Ms. Hoovers social media references to giving her all our tears made sense to me. Because I gave them all to her! IT ENDS WITH US completely wrecked me. The first 35 I kept thinking this is all too cute and sweet, whats going to happen. And once you figure out where this is going and the title then clicked for me my heart started breaking. And I dont think it ever recovered until the very last few pages. Its easy to see that this was an emotional book to write because that gut wrenching experience came through vividly for the reader. This was even clearer after reading Ms. Hoovers note in the end. And then more tears were shed. I think what I can appreciate the most about this book is how it made me think. There are many subjects we all think we know better and we know what we should and would do if confronted with those situations. But we often dont put ourselves in the shoes of the person going through it. The fact that this book made me rethink that, and even question what wouldve been a given decision at certain points was eye opening for me. And it definitely made me have a new appreciation for the strength required to overcome those situations. This is Colleen Hoovers best work in a really long time! I would say best ever, but I wish the beginning wouldve gripped me more. One thing is for sure. Once it did, it didnt let my heart go. It put it through the wringer and left it in a million pieces on the floor. This is not an easy book to read, but its an experience I highly recommend. I know Im being terribly vague, but I dont want to spoil the book for you. You may have the misconception from the blurb that this might be a love triangle. So Ill just clarify one thing. Its really isnt, and theres an explanation for that. It is a story about second chances. And there is no cheating. Hopefully that clears enough hang ups you may have. But just know this one thing. This book is touching, its hard, its emotional, its heartbreaking, its deep, and its very human. And after all that heartache theres a happily ever after I could be excited for and made me smile. I have to say thank you to Ms. Hoover for opening up her heart with all of us and sharing this story. Now that Ive finished writing this, I feel like I need a few minutes to go quietly cry in a corner and put my heart back together. Favorite quote: There is no such thing as bad people. Were all jut people who sometimes do bad things. Fifteen seconds. Thats all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that well never get back.
4.5 I had really high hopes for this one after hearing so much about it and reading Amy and Rogers Epic Detour. I am happy to say that my expectations were filled. I really enjoyed this read. It had a great group of characters that were very realistic and relatable. I wanted them to be my friends, and at times I felt like they were. I loved Dawn, and her relationship with Matt was fun. And Frank and Matts relationship was awesome. I adored the part where they were doing the contest to see who was a larger fan of The Beatles. And then theres Frank and Emily. I SHIP IT! They were so, so, cute, and I wanted them to be together almost instantly. The plot was really interesting and immediately hooked me in. I enjoyed the mystery of Sloane. I also loved how the story would often have scenes from the past. I liked learning new things about characters such as Sloane. I wanted to be her friend too... but then later on I didnt really want to so much anymore. I think she treated Emily a little bit unfairly. She would be super fun to hang around with, but I think that Emily is better off without her. Having said this, I did feel bad for Sloane and the life she had, moving from place to place. And it was such fun going through the list of strange tasks Sloane left for Emily. And it was truly wonderful watching Emily discover herself and break through her shell as she completed the tasks. I could really relate to Emily and her shyness and I found her transformation to be rather inspiring. Plus this book had a really nice touch of humor that I enjoyed. I love it when a book has me laughing! And on a side note, I loved Emily and Franks playlists. I like it when books have fun little things like that. It really adds to the book. And the song House Of Gold by Twenty One Pilots was on one of Franks playlists, and that made me very, very happy. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because of the ending. I found it to be too openended. I have a lot of unanswered questions. But other than that, this was a great read that Id definitely recommend if youre looking for a summery, cute and fun contemporary romance. I cant wait to read more of Morgan Matsons books!
I have to say that the whole world that Novik created gave me a nostalgic feeling. It reminded me of the fairy tales you read when you were a child and it was wonderful. The Wood is so intriguing and complex so that it kept you guessing on its reasons and its history while also keep on surprising you. I also loved, that in the end we got answers to everything and that the Wood got its redemption. Moving on to the characters. I had a few moments where I was super annoyed with our main character, Agniezka. Mostly in the beginning. At first, when she said she was clumsy, I thought she was the usual a little clumsy but still weirdly able to do everything except stumbling from time to time. But oh boy was I wrong. I didnt know I was meeting the Queen of Clumsiness, who probably, possibly invented clumsiness. That wasnt even the annoying part. Okay well the fact that she knew how a spell of how to at least look clean and never using it did make me mad and annoyed. Because yes, looks arent everything but when you are meeting your king and you go to parties of the nobles to convince them to help you and that you are a real witch, at least look clean. You dont even have to wear elaborate and uncomfortable silk dresses. Just something that is not mudsplattered and constantly ripped. please. But other than that her clumsiness was almost funny and refreshing since she actually was clumsy although I do have to admit that I was, just like the Dragon, wondering how the heck she managed to make such a mess of herself. But the part that got me was her stubbornness against her magic. Like I get it, finding out that the only reason you were snatched away from your family and forced to live in a tower with a moody and grumpy man for the next 10 years, is the magic in you, is hard. On the other hand, think about all the great things magic can do!! Like make splendid meals, get you all dressed up with minimal effort even your hair and makeup, it just overall makes things easier and is so useful. I mean leaving the vain things of appearance apart you can still build and create things with magic that you couldnt with your without. So really, I honestly would kill to be able to do magic but whatever, she eventually embraced the whole magic thing which set my mind at ease. I liked that there was some kind of doubt because of the age difference since no one ever seems to be bothered by it at all. So overall, I really loved the Dragon and his relationship with Agniezka. The end was kind of very satisfying and it just made me very happy. I mean that would be my dream life if I lived in a world full of magic, tending to an old mysterious wood and just kind of living in my own cozy cottage. And I mean the Dragon did come back and in my mind they are both living in the tower and her cottage and just kind of working together peacefully to clear the Wood of all evils. Im so happy for them! Also, how cute are the Walkers trying to help her, even risking their lifes for it?
An extraordinary child of 6 years old, Ender Wiggins, is recruited to go to Battle School to learn how to fight The Buggers, an alien race that threatens the existence of the human race. While in Battle School Ender learns that the buggers are not his only enemies. Thats all Ill say about that! I dont want to give anything away because this was a thrilling read and I wouldnt want to spoil anyone. I definitely see why this book is regarded as a real game changer for science fiction. Considering when it came out, some of the technology the author describes is eerily prophetic. I can also see the origins of most of the latest science fiction books and movies in this story. The authors world building is pretty great, especially his description of the Battle School and battles themselves. I could almost picture everything. Almost. There were some descriptions that left me scratching my head because they were so odd or abstract, I couldnt picture them. When that happened, I just tried to get the gist of what formations and positions he was trying to describe. However for the most part, I could follow the battles and fight scenes. And there are a lot of them, in almost in every chapter. I can understand the criticism that the drills and battles become too repetitive, but I dont think so. With each battle and fight, we learn more about Enders thought process, his fears and weaknesses, his strengths, his struggle. We see him grow as a character. So from a distance it may seem like a bunch of the same fights, but every battle in this story brings revelation, and I dont think that could have been done without going into detail. Speaking of Ender. I fell in love with him. It was easy to forget he was a 6 year old boy. In fact, thats my primary criticism of this story the idea of a genius 6 year old doing the things Ender does just seems implausible to me. I never really bought it. I felt much more comfortable picturing him as 10 or even 12, and I was relieved when he started aging over the course of the story. Also, sometimes Ender seemed a little too perfect. He made mistakes, but he never really failed, and I think that puts some distance between him and the reader. Hes a sympathetic hero, but hes not entirely tangible, IMO. Anyway, someone spoiled the ending for me, so I wasnt as surprised as I could have been, but there is a big twist and its pretty awesome and chilling. This whole book actually is chilling. I found the premise of adults using children to fight a war really disturbing. The ending of the book was a bit odd, but I like it, and I can see the possibility for a series, so I will definitely read on.
The Lunar Chronicles is just one heck of a series. Just take your favorite Disney Princesses. Now take your favorite dystopian setting. Make your Princesses totally awesome  make one a cyborg alien, one a kickbutt fighter, and the last a genius hacker. Finally, toss in some dangerous Queens with mindcontrol power, a yummy Prince, a dangerous wolf, and a hella cute Captain and THERE YOU HAVE IT. The Lunar Chronicles. Basically I am in love. All of the characters have their own little part to play, and each is really awesome. Cress is just adorable. Shes an amazing hacker, has been trapped in a satellite for most of her life cough, cough Rapunzel duh, and is totally in love with the rakish Captain Thorne. Now, this might elicit a few raised eyebrows, but Thorne is my favorite out of the guys. Kai is too unsure and Wolf is too wild. But I love Thorne. Ever since he first popped up, he has made me laugh and had me glued to my chair. I do wish Cress hadnt been in love with him from the start because...it hindered the development of their relationship. Everything seemed really plastic until they finally decided to trust each other as friends, and then the real sparks flew. It was a little rushed feeling, but settled down eventually. Yay. Thorne. Although I might still like his friendship with Cinder more, they are hilarious. The reappearances of previous characters are just woven in so seamlessly, even though the protagonists are changing. Cinder is still fighting to figure out how best to proceed after her shocking discovery. Wolf and Scarlet are just getting used to trusting each other and being a part of this strange team when...BAM suckerpunched in the heart wait until you read it. I think I nearly died in frustration. And then of course, there is Kai, who makes me grin like an idiot. Prince Charming indeed. More like Prince very cute and very confused. i only want more time with all of the characters together. The group dynamic is perfect, and there should be less splitting up and more teamwork. Otherwise, what is the point of all these characters in one series? They could just have their own. More togetherness. All the aspects of the fairy tales we love, and an incredible dystopian setting ranging the entire world including the moon make this book so fabulous. There is so much going on it seems like nothing should work. It should be too confusing and crazy to even make sense much less be absolutely phenomenal. Dystopian settings can get so complex, authors tend to pick a country and stick to it. Rarely do we ever see a setting jumping from China to France to Africa to the Moon in such a small space of time with dystopian elements. Plus we have aliens with mindcontrol. Its so special and so crazy. Im just jumping with joy for this book and WHOA is the next book going to be amazing. Winter is clearly a little off her rocker and I am excited for an unpredictable character. Plus, Queen Levana needs to be destroyed and I need to see all my favorite characters happily married. And so I march on.
Awesome wont describe this books awesomeness. The best book Ive read so far. The book is about to college seniors ,geniuses, who found a way to cheat death a way to make themselves Extraordinary. This book isnt about protagonists and antagonists : There are no good men in this game, Victor and Eli were friends for only one reason theyre both bad both evil both monsters and that was their charm as you can see good and evil are just semantics : Its why I let you stay, said Victor. Why I liked you. All that charm outside, all that evil inside. There was a monster under there, long before you died. They were the perfect team at college : All Eli had to do was smile. All Victor had to do was lie. Both proved frighteningly effective. But something along the way went wrong ,definitively wrong:  Plenty of humans were monstrous, and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human. The difference between Victor and Eli, he suspected, wasnt their opinion on EOs. It was their reaction to them. Eli seemed intent to slaughter them, but Victor didnt see why a useful skill should be destroyed, just because of its origin. EOs were weapons, yes, but weapons with minds and wills and bodies, things that could be bent and twisted and broken and used. And that was the difference between the genuinely charming evil Victor and Eli whom I think was overrated like Victor gave him too much credit than he deserved. I never expected that end it was amazing its one of the many things that made me think that Victor was the best character I ever encountered in all the books that I read . Other proofs of Victors awesomeness: There were some people you had to stay away from, people who poisoned everything in reach. Then there were people you wanted to stick with, the ones with silver tongues and golden touches. And then, there were people you stood beside, because it meant you werent in their way. And whoever Victor Vale was, whatever he was, and whatever he was up to, the only thing Mitch knew was that he did not want to be in his way. .Lets hope thats not the worst crime I commit tonight,.
No Spoilers I honestly didnt know if Id read this new Shadowhunters book. After being so disappointed with The Mortal Instruments last three books, I was afraid I was just burnt out on this world. But as soon as it showed up on my doorstep, I dove in. I shouldve known I couldnt resist. I cannot tell you how glad I am that I got over my thoughts of moving past this world. This book was AWESOME. So familiar, yet so very different. I rarely read books that are this long, but I was so completely engrossed in this story that it couldve been twice as long and I never wouldve been bored. The emotions that Cassie Clare is able to infuse her stories with are just magical. This is easily one of my favorite books ever. It was like having the first three Mortal Instruments books and The Infernal Devices books blended together into one. For those that are worried that this will just be a repeat of her other books, I dont feel it is at all. Im sure there will be some who disagree, but I felt like the dynamics of this story and these characters were completely new and absolutely captivating. Julian Blackthorn is not another Jace Herondale. Not even a little. I wont say too much because I dont want to spoil anything, but I just want to give a huge shoutout to the girl power in this book. Emma definitely takes center stage and she is incredible! In every way. All the girls are seriously fantastic. Theyre strong, smart, loyal, and totally fierce. And I cant write this review without mentioning the amazing family dynamics of the Blackthorns. I adored all of them, and reading their interactions with each other. Julian has had to go through so much to keep his family together and cared for, and Cassie made me fall in love with each of them. I had every possible emotion as I read through Lady Midnight. It isnt often that I literally laugh out loud, and there were times that I was cracking up. But this story was also heartbreaking, gruesome, and so full of every kind of tension. We all know that Cassandra Clare likes to rip our hearts out with the forbidden romances, and this is definitely no exception. I think the next book in this series is going to be FULL OF PAIN. But I will endure this torture because it is so worth it If only I had an endurance rune. One of the things I really appreciated about Lady Midnight is that even though this is a series, and there is a larger story that hasnt been fully explored, this book had its own story arc and it was resolved, so I didnt feel like I was hanging off that cliff by my fingernails. It makes the wait a little more bearable. If youre still on the fence about whether you want to continue this world, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Do you remember the way you felt when you read City of Bones, or Clockwork Angel? Dont you want that feeling again? Well, here it is, just waiting for you! Carpe Librum! ?

All right, so headsupmy review for this book is going to have a few spoilers. with that ENDING, how can it not? To begin, this is a beautiful, beautiful story. There are a lot of tropey elements, but each instance that could have seemed like cliche was turned around, or written in such a way as to be enjoyable and fresh. The writing style is clear and pleasantly lyrical when it needs to be. What drew me in the most was how adventurous the story is. Two orphans who become soldiers, a dark and murky sea filled with evil vampirecreatures, harsh class divides and spectacular magic and politics galoreall things its quite impossible to fail to enjoy. I also loved the charactersAlina is frail, and human, but she also has a good heart. It was epic to see her find her backbone and her bearings amidst all the craziness of sudden court life, and even more epic when she finally had the strength to break away from that life entirely. Mal, of course, was fantastic. Though hes a fairly quiet character, hes an extremely relatable one; and his nobility, loyalty and good sense were a huge breath of fresh air in the midst of all the magical and political confusion. The Darkling gets a lot of press, and right now Im on the fence about him. Though he seemed like an interesting antihero at first, and remains a curious character still, I feel like the story pushed him into utter villainy a little unrealistically. His romantic interest in Alina is oddtheres an intimation that hes genuinely interested in her, which I find hard to understand. Im certainly curious to see more of him, though. The one major and also majorly spoilery complaint I have about this book is the bit near the end, in the Shadow Fold. So. Much. Death. And why? I understand that the Darkling has to be made out to be the villain, and I understand that he has to kill a lot of people to drive that home it could definitely have been done without destroying an entire village, but oh well. What I dont understand is Alinas eventual decision to leave an entire shipful of people to be eaten by monsters. An entire shipful of people who are not all evil, who followed the Darkling for reasons of their own, a shipful of people just about as innocent as anyone in this book. I just...dont understand why Alina thought they had to die, and the narrative glosses over the incident without either a realistic shockhorrormourning period or a decent reason why it had to happen. As much as I love this story, that bit of the book continues to irk me. Overall, however, Im in love with the world of this series, and Im excited to see where the story leads :
Not my particular cup of tea, but very wellwritten by a talented author. I buddyread this with my sons best friend Rose, 16, to discuss prior to Roses English lit project. I suppose I was not as invested in the story as I usually am, for that reason. I was distracting myself with the technical aspects of the writing, in preparation for our discussion, instead of just enjoying the story. In effect, I was in teacher mode. 4 stars for the author: Shirley Jackson was a fantastic writer. This story reads as a sort of literary haunted house story, and it is very wellcrafted. Its creepy rather than horrifying or shocking, and the dialogueinner thoughts of the characters really carry the tale, as others have remarked. There is weirdness, and tension building; complicated interrelationships, and an unreliable narrator. 3 stars for the story: While I liked the oddness, and the meandering trip to our awareness that manythingsarenotquiteright, overall I wasnt so keen on the openended interpretation of certain events and of the ending. Its not this particular book; that sort of conclusion never really works for me. I wanted both more backstory, and a firmer conclusion; it felt like being perpetually in the middle of something. Maybe I just wanted it to be longer? Perhaps it was the midcentury attitudes of the characters as well, their tones and opinions, under the surface of their immediate conversation? Im not sure. I was just left vaguely unsatisfied, and not fully invested in the characters. Maybe a future reread, without tutoring responsibilities, would allow me to appreciate the story more. Overall, I do recommend this book to those who like a spooky, literary ghost story, by a writer at the height of her talented career. It has appealed to many others before me.  Postscript: A Goodreads friend mentioned in her review the profound unease that Jackson builds throughout the story, and that helped me identify one of my personal issues. Ive decided that that pervasive feeling of unease throughout the story did too good of a job making me feel uncomfortable, suspicious of what I was being told, and outofsorts. I suppose that I dont like that sort of result, when I want to be entertained. I wanted to be truly scared; but because I could see some of where the story was headed, the unending unease just left me a bit annoyed. Thats just me, though! So many others have loved this tale, that its wellworth a try.  edited twice for typos
UPDATE 91616: After over 2 years worth of distance from this book, this review is probably closer to the opposite of how I feel now. Life experiences and education have changed my view on a lot of the books I used to read, so just know that while I felt a certain way about this book before, I certainly dont feel the same now... By far the BEST book that Colleen Hoover has written to date! Im in awe of how well this woman can capture my feels! Every single book Ive ever read by her has taken me on the HIGHEST emotional journey, but this one takes the cake. I am in serious awe. Maybe Someday has officially surpassed Hopeless as my favorite Colleen Hoover book, in terms of story. Holder will always been my favorite CH book boyfriend, but Ridge is a CLOSE second. This book follows Sydney, a 22yearold college student, and Ridge, her guitarplaying neighbor. Due to random circumstances, these two form a friendship that becomes intense very quickly. Right off the bat, I knew I would like Ridge. His introduction into the plot was very adorable and swoon worthy, if only because he had NO lines at all. It was all presence. Sydneys character is very strong. Shes very smart, yet naive at the same time. Shes annoying yet endearing. I cared about her immediately. Ridge claimed a special place in my heart within the first third of the book for reasons I cant say without spoiling, but his personality is so beautiful. But its also his weakness, which is learned through the book. Colleen has always been extremely good at giving the main characters depth and room to grow, within various situations, as well as through encounters with the supporting characters. I absolutely LOVED the supporting characters in this book  Warren, Maggie, Brennan  they all enhanced the story in a HUGE way. The moments between Warren and Sydney were actually some of my favorite moments in the book. Those two acted like brother and sister, though Warren is a huge flirt, and it was so endearing. Seeing the growth in their friendship and how much Warren came to care for Sydney was so fantastic to read about. Its quite obvious that Ridge and Sydney grow to have romantic feelings for each other, but due to various circumstances, they are unable to act on them. Experiencing their struggles with fighting their attraction and remain platonic friends was probably one of the most difficult things about this book, amongst other things. I felt so much for these two, as a potential couple and as individuals. I was rooting for both of them. This book has a couple of shocks that you really dont expect and even when they were happening, I found myself thinking something else entirely. This book was just amazing. Its the perfect depiction of bad timing when it comes to potential relationships; of the inevitable act of hurting someone even though you do everything in your power to avoid; its human nature. Its honest. The intention of Hoover with this book is very clear. If theres anything that I learned from reading this book its you honestly cant win against a battle of the heart. You just cant. But witnessing the war was heartbreakingly beautiful.
Its 6.21am; so sleep first, review later.  I was provided an ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. One of Us IS Lying is the story of four teenagers. It is told by all four points of view. First up is Bronwyn, straight A student, smart, determined and resourceful. SheaEURtms the perfect Ravenclaw. Next is Cooper, the star pitcher. He would be the perfect jock except he is sooooo nice and just all around decent, basically the perfect Hufflepuff. Then, we have Abby. Abby is popular but lacks confidence. SheaEURtms been dating the star running back of the football team for about three years. And last but not least, thereaEURtms Nate, the criminal, my child. HeaEURtms been arrested for drug dealing and is now on probation. His dad is a drunk and he has to take care of the bills and shit. To me, heaEURtms a Slytherin but I might not be impartial because I am a Slytherin and itaEURtms the best house ever. Why do I insist on sorting them, you will never know. I donaEURtmt even know... These four characters are everything. I connected to them in so many ways. The ones I didnaEURtmt love at first sight, grew on me like you wouldnaEURtmt believe. They were just so complex and flawed, I couldnaEURtmt help but love them. The side characters were also really interesting and I loved many of them. Id protect Maeve with my life. On to the plot. I donaEURtmt actually want to say a lot because just jumping in without knowing much might actually be best for this book. The book starts with our four babies in detention with Simon. Simon is the gossip king of the school. He even has an app dedicated to it with weekly updates. What he writes on it always turns out to be true. Problem is, Simon has an anaphylactic shock during detention and dies. Our four protagonists are the main suspects. The intrigue was so well told, I couldnaEURtmt figure what had truly happen. Even when I suspected, I dismissed it almost instantly. It kept me on my toes the entire time. What I also liked in this book was the growth of the characters, as well as the relationships whether they were romantic or not between them. I found them really captivating and couldnaEURtmt help but root for them. I could feel what the characters felt, there was an actual growth and I could feel our their feelings evolved. I seriously loved this side of the book too. The author also showed the double standards we have in our society and how it can affects everyday life. I read this book in one sitting and simply couldnaEURtmt put it down. All in all, an amazing debut novel. I will be impatiently waiting for more from this author.
Only Jennifer L. Armentrout could make gargoyles and demons look sexy! Since the first page I was instantly hooked and fell in love with all the characters. Being a fan of Jens I knew instantly that I would love this book! There is action, swoonworthy romances, and White Hot Kiss will leave you wanting more. Like many books of Jens there is a love triangle that will make you choose who will win Laylas heart. This is one book everyone must add to their list because it is an amazing read! Layla was a great character! I love Jennifers main characters and they are always kicking butt. She is always trying to help. Layla is having a hard time trying to fit in with her Warden family since she is half gargoyle and have demon. Most of the family doesnt trust her because of her abilities. She goes to school and craves for a normal life and become more than friends with Zayne. Then enters Roth, things get really complicated. Layla has to choose between everything she thought was good or bad. She is learning more about herself and her demon part. I absolutely loved White Hot Kiss and its a little different than reading Jens other series. This book is a favorite of mine because of the two love interests, a war starts and you do not know which boy to choose between. I am a Team Roth fan because well Roth is hot and gorgeous. I thought I would be a Zayne fan but Roth just stole my heart. Zayne is a normal book boyfriend that everyone falls for which there was moments I love both of them but after you read White Hot Kiss you will know why I love Roth. Zayne is Laylas best friend and will protect Layla. It is really difficult to choose which one!! White Hot Kiss was a book that I finished in a day! I did not put it down and its a good thing to because that story line was addicting and will leave you hanging on your seat. Jennifer L. Armentrout makes romance steamy and heartwrenching since her characters are so likable. I am excited to see what is going to happen with the next book where the story will go and the romance. I want to reread any of Jennifers book over and over because she know how to write amazing stories. She is the queen of writing and I will read any of her books! White Hot Kiss was addictive story! This is a must read for everyone!! It will blow you away and leave you craving for more!! The wait starts for Stone Cold Touch!!! A Big thank you to Harlequin Teen for the advance copy and making my day when I got the email!! So excited for any of Jens books!!
Illuminae is the first book in the young adult series, The Illuminae Files 1 by author duo Amie Kaufman  Jay Kristoff. I think I am one of the last people in the world to finally jump on board and read Illuminae. Now that the paperback version of the book is coming out, and book 3 in the series is coming out later this year, I knew it was finally time to read book one. I have heard nothing but amazing things about the book, and I have heard the series being called different enough times, that I had to see for myself. And now I can confidently say...I am a huge Illuminae fan! This book is so awesome. I know it has been said a lot, but the format of this series is like nothing else I have ever read. I absolutely loved it. It has to be super difficult to write and put together because I could tell how complicated and detailed the world is. I mean the scope of this series is just huge. The Illuminae files are the story of our two main characters Ezra and Kady. At the start of the book, the two of them had just broken up, and then their planet gets destroyed and they are caught up in a whirlwind escape, and then the adventure is just starting for them. Illuminae took me a little bit of time to catch my bearings. It is very scifi so there are all kinds of foreign terms. Take that and add it to the fact that the book is not told in a traditional format. We are basically Erza and Kady, searching through things and reading redacted files, notes, clues and all kinds of things. It is so immersive and quite frankly, awesome. It is part novel, part be your own detective story. I completely love it. I became really, really absorbed in Illuminae. I was totally immersed in the world Jay and Amie created, and I was right along side the characters, overwhelmed, and confused at points and totally fascinated with the whole thing. Plus, the twists and turns are crazy! Crazy people! Bottom line: The Illuminae Files is a book that you really have to experience for yourself. Gosh, this book was an incredible experience. I dont remember anything like it. It really earns the title of unique and different. Not to mention, I am also loving the romance. More on this after I read the next book. I loved this book. It is always going to be a favorite of mine because I will never forget this book. Read Illuminae. Or reread it to get ready for book 3. But if you are new to the series, like I was, now is the perfect time to grab a copy and start reading.
4.55 stars Warning for the ladies: Do Not Wear Mascara While Reading this book. I was sitting at my sisters soccer banquet reading The Fault in Our Stars nerd alert. I kept anticipating someone coming up and asking me what I was reading. Which left me dumbfounded. The only thing that popped into my head was, Its not a Cancer Book! You know the books Im talking about. If you are my age you probably read Lurlene McDaniels One Last Wish series when you were younger. Or maybe youve given Nicholas Sparks Cancer Books a try. At first glance, that assessment seems unfair. Both of the main characters are cancer patients. So how can I possibly say that its not a Cancer Book? Because this book is about much more than death, much more than the Noble Cancer Patient Battling Triumphantly. This is a book about life, because even in the face of dying, what Esther and Augustus are struggling with is life. Its a book that asks the Big Questions. Questions about what it means to be human, what it means to be alive and what happens after death. Its a thought provoking novel, where cancer is the driving force but not the whole story. Who am I to say that these things might not be forever? Who is Peter Van Houten to assert as fact the conjectures that our labor is temporary? All I know of heaven and all I know of death is in this park: an elegant universe in ceaseless motion, teeming with ruined ruins and screaming children. Even in the midst of being brilliantly deep, its also delightfully snarky. To me, that is realism. Very few people sit around thinking deep thoughts all the time. People are deep, people are angry and people are silly, none of these excludes the others. Hazel is both introspective and human, contemplating oblivion, then complaining about Cancer Perks or how her lungs suck at being lungs. I didnt tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! Youre a woman. Now Die. The characters talk about cancer differently than in any Cancer Book Ive ever read. They sound like real teenagers, albeit extremely intelligent ones, who have already discovered the sad truth that the world is not fair. Or as they say The world is not a wishgranting factory. The book goes between being funny and heartwrenching in a way that I dont think has ever been done. Normally you have books that make me laugh then on another shelf books that make me cry. Very rarely do you have books that make you do both. Its hard for a book to balance both humor and poignancy, but John Green manages to do that perfectly with The Fault in Our Stars.
I wish Stephen King would do a short story collection each year, because it always seems like too long to wait between volumes! This was a good collection of stories with plenty of variety. He seems to be getting a little more poignant lately as some of the stories were sad, and not because of horror. As for the stories, briefly: Mile 81 was a cool story about a killer car, but really nothing that grand. Still fun though, and the type of horror King does best. Premium Harmony was probably my least favorite story in the collection. It just seemed depressing and I think I missed the point. Batman and Robin was another of the sad stories, but touching. The Dune read almost like an O. Henry type tale, with the twist ending. Bad Little Kid was more of the horror that only King can pull off. Creepy stuff. A Death I found personally interesting because it had a western setting, and Ive written a few weird westerns myself. Ur was great for anyone who owns a kindle. Youll have to read it to see what I mean. Morality was a look at the darker side of human nature, something King has done many times before. This story will make you think. Afterlife was a take on what happens after we die. Interesting. Herman Wouk is Still Alive is possibly the darkest story in the collection, and probably based on an amalgamation of true events. Under the Weather is gruesome and sad at the same time. Another one that was little too dark for me but because of the sadness and not any horror elements. Blockade Billy I had read before. This was Stephen King combining his love of baseball and love of horror. Good one. Mister Yummy featured a new look at the Grim Reaper. A very original look at the Grim Reaper come to think of it. Little Green God of Agony was very much traditional King horror, which is a good thing. That Bus is Another World is a new take on a classic ghost story trope. Obits was another King type tale. Remember Word Processor of the Gods? If you liked that one, youll probably like this one. Drunken Fireworks was comedy, but enjoyable. Summer Thunder was an end of the world tale, something Stephen King has done several times before. This one was dedicated to Kurt Sutter and fans of SOA will recognize the ending. There were a few poems as well, also enjoyable. So overall, another great short story collection from Stephen King. Night Shift is probably my favorite book of all time, and I have to admit this one was no Night Shift some people may like this one better due to its diversity and more human stories but I dig the horror, baby! Still, another great work from my favorite author. Cant wait for the next collection!
With each book I read in the Lunar Chronicles, I fall deeper in love with Marissa Meyers characters and her storytelling. Its well documented in my letter to the author after I read Scarlet, that I had mixed feelings about Cinder but was completely hooked on the series by the end of book two. Cress is even better. Although Scarlet and Wolf remain my favorite pairing, this book is the most complex and exciting. I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the entire way through, riveted to these characters stories and the twisting plot. Although we now have three main couples, plus secondaries and villains, Meyer has managed to make all of the characters feel present and vital, even when they are separated or at odds with each other. Even more than Cinder and Scarlet, Cress manages to balance several story lines without slowing down the plot. And possibly my most favorite aspect of this series is how Meyer continues to play with fairytale details in surprising ways, continually making her stories fresh and original. This time its Cress and Thornes turn in the fairytale spotlight. And if you dont yet know what story they come from, its the one with the girl with the long hair. I really enjoyed seeing details from Rapunzel in Cress, especially because this fairytale is not quite as widely known as the previous two inspirations. With so many plots converging, Cress and Thorne are not the only characters or storyline in the spotlight. We meet a few new characters, finally glimpsing all of our major players. We also travel throughout earth, into space and onto Luna. One of my favorite parts of this series is the wonderful mix of scifi space elements, including satellites and space ships, with a variety of continents and cultures. In Cress, were also seeing all the pieces of this story line up, getting a larger picture of this world and what these characters will be facing in the final book Winter. I cant wait. Despite the fact that these are fairytale characters  some with exciting extra abilities, because of their Luna alien natures  they have real struggles and insecurities. They can be pretty quirky or even odd at times, and they are incredibly strong in some ways and vulnerable in others. Its an interesting juxtaposition that serves to make the characters relatable, and also creates many nail biting scenes. Im very much enjoying the dynamic between all of them, and the ways Meyer forces different members of the team to work together. Heres the thing, despite how much I adored this book and the Rapunzel storyline, Cress and Thorne are not my favorite couple. They dont seem evenly matched or like they have much if any common ground. I just didnt sense a lot of chemistry between them. Im hoping this will change on the final book. However, surprisingly, none of this dragged down Cress for me. With fast paced, edgeofyourseat action, at least one surprising revelation, strong original fairytale elements and space ships galore, Cress is a hit all the way through, once again proving Marissa Meyers vast storytelling abilities.

The third installment in Jay Crownovers exceptional Welcome to the Point series was the one I was waiting for. Titus King, the lone good guy in the series about bad people, doing bad things, in a bad town, has fascinated me from the start. His story was exactly what I hoped it would be. Thrilling, hardfought, unputdownable. Detective King has a streak of honor in him that keeps him fighting for The Point, even knowing its a losing battle. With a new threat in the horizon, and a war for control of the city just around the corner, the last thing he needs is the beautiful, deadly Reeve Black to reappear in his life. Reeve is determined to help the cop that shes been infatuated with from the moment she met him. She has the information Titus needs to hunt down and cut off the threat, and shes willing to work with him to make amends for past mistakes. But hes a good man trying to protect his city and the ones he loves, and shes a bad girl that isnt sure she can find the right path to redemption. How can they exist together when they appear to be on opposite sides of right and wrong? Wow, Ms. Crownover is one hell of a storyteller. I was utterly mesmerized by this fantastic book from the startthe explosive prologue that set the tone for the rest of this ballstothewall, edgeofyourseat suspense. Better When Hes Brave is a redemption tale that blurs the lines, in much the same way Titus himself starts to blur them in the pursuit of justice and safety for his people. I loved the hell out of the strong, beastly, sexy cop and I couldnt have stopped reading his tale if youd paid me. Youd have been wasting your money if you tried. There is much contradiction in this book and in these characters, and Ms. Crownover balances it perfectly. There are many potentially unlikeable characters that appear in this series and yet, almost all make you want to wish and cheer and hope for them. I found myself wanting to forgive the unforgivable and trying to find the right in all the wrong. Even when they made poor choices, lied, manipulated, endangered, I still wanted them to get their chance at the ultimate love. I wanted Titus and Reeve to find their more not just between the sheets, where they absolutely burned up, but in the big, bad world. That want, that hope, also applies to the characters to come. Im anticipating the fourth book already, intrigued by the seemingly irredeemable Nassir and how Ms. Crownover plans to make him into an antihero we can all get behind. I can only hope its as actionpacked and heartracing as this thrilling installment. Im waiting...  Beth, 5 stars
I started reading The Rose and the Dagger just moments after finishing The Wrath and the Dawn. I enjoyed the previous book so much, I was super curious to see how The Rose and the Dagger would compare. Once I started reading this book, I was completely captivated, and, if possible, I think I love it even more than the first book! Shahrzad is quickly becoming one of my most favorite heroines. I love that shes so determined and willing to do whatever she needs to do to save the ones that she loves, even when putting herself in danger to accomplish it. Her relationship with Khalid is perfection, and I loved all the swoonworthy moments between the two. They are definitely one of my favorites couples of all time. There are so many secondary characters in this series that I love, a few that we met in the first book, and some we meet for the first time in the sequel. They are all so well written, you cant help but love them, except for the ones that youll love to hate, and there are more than a few of them as the story goes along. The storyline for the book picks up right where the previous book leaves off. I dove right into the pages, dying to know what was going to happen next, especially after that ending in The Wrath and the Dawn. I do believe this book was an even wilder ride than the first book, as it definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. There are quite a few twists and turns throughout the story as well, and I love that it kept me guessing. And, the book seriously has the most perfect ending. Everything came together wonderfully, and I was left completely satisfied after I closed the last page. I love it when that happens. Overall; I adored this series so very much, and implore you to check them both The Wrath and the Dawn and The Rose and the Dagger! This series was full of adventure and romance, and it will keep you completely captivated as you turn the pages. I know it did for me, and Renee Ahdieh is definitely now on my list of authors to watch to keep an eye out for. I cant wait to read more by her in the future!! Happy Reading!!
OMG, I have no words. This book was absolutely fantastic! Action packed to a whole new level, I just couldnt put it down. Its marvelous how Marissa can portray so many different characters and have them all speak up and stand out. Wolf and Scarlet are still my favorite couple, they truly show how the inside is what matters. Learn a lesson, Levana. Cress evolved a lot I think, she really steps up and is brave enough to help the revolution in spite of being afraid. True courage there. Her relationship with Thorne was not my favorite even though I love the characters because it lacks communication and they kind frustrated me a little. I mean, just tell her you love her, dude! But all in all, it was pretty sweet. Cinder and Kai are always perfect. Cinder goes through a lot of issues in this book, she has to deal with a whole planet and trying not to let anyone down. And Kai... sighs We already met Jacin, who at the beginning of the book seems a traitor to Cinders cause, but then we realize he is just trying to survive in order to protect Princess Winter. I just adore how much he loves her and is there for her every single time she needs him. Winter reminded me of Luna Lovegood because of her oddities, her special way of talking and because she is a little crazy but in a good way. Shes so sweet, I just want to hug her. The story follows the events after Cress, but I would recommend reading Fairest before Winter to have a better picture of Levana great evil character, I love it when they think they are right and people are just mean to them. I love how the story respects a story line so the events dont jump onto one another, its really harmonic. Our heroes suffer a lot, laugh a little less expected in the middle of a war, of course but dont lose themselves. I adored the evolution of each one of the characters from day one. I already miss them...! The ending of the war and Levanas final scene were a little flat for me because Im curious and it wasnt really explained WHAT happened, it was more makebelieve. Im buying it all right, but I would have liked to know more details about how things went down. The ending was an open one for me, and I enjoyed it because it was believable and realistic. You cant fix everything over a week, so it was a good ending. I would like to see the fate of our beloved characters, but I think well get that in Stars Above. All in all, Winter was an spectacular book to end the series and I loved every bit of it. 5 out of 5 stars for this jewel!
This book broke my heart, glued it together, and then smashed it into the cobblestones of my soul until there was nothing but tiny little heart shaped dust fluttering around. It was that intense. First, I must admit that I went into this book with a predisposition to hate it. I know, I know, how can I say that? Why even bother if I thought I would hate it? Let me explain. I went into this book having read many reviews of it. Some were bad, but most were good. The problem was that those good ones only ever compared this book to The Fault in Our Stars, a book which I publicly dislike. So, me being me, went into reading with my mind set that Violet and Finch were the next Hazel and Augustus, and so, everything they did in the beginning was annoying to me. WHile unfair, it was not unfounded. Much like Hazel and Augustus, Violet and Finch are the type of teenagers that deep down are secretly pretentious philosophising English professors that quote random novels as a form of flirting, and sit around around wondering which is the best Bronte sister, while holding unlit cigarette in their mouths seriously though that last one is a bit of a rip off from TFIOS. Anyway, after I got past that little annoyance, and really started to get to know them, I really fell in love with these characters, especially Finch. The wonderful, lovely, Theodore Finch. They, unlike Hazel and Augustus, were intelligent and worldly without being pretentious. They were kind and extraordinary without calling attention to themselves. They were real and relatable and heart breaking. Mostly, unlike TFIOS, this shows a more realistic depiction of the illness it is presenting. As my coblogger, Rosie, many times says, the world is more than butterflies, rainbows and unicorn farts, and this book shows you that. This is a book about relationships, not just with a boyfriendgirlfriend, but with family and all the people we meet. It is a book about love and acceptance and lost. It is a book about mental illness and how it is stigmatized and judged, and many times goes unnoticed until it is too late. Violet is a girl whose sister is dead. Finch is a boy obsessed with the idea of dying. The two meet at the ledge of building as they both contemplate what it would be like to jump. From then on a rocky friendship ensues and then something more. From there comes many ups and downs and it is intense, and raw, and real, and beautifully heartbreaking. That is all I can say without spoiling everything. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. There is a lot of talk of mental illness, abuse, and suicide, so be warned if this is something you cannot handle. Aside from that, it is a book I think anyone would love. This book gets all the start!
Following Throne of Glass, I had high expectations of this book. I absolutely loved the first book and I was so excited to read this book. Normally the second book in a series can be a bit of a disappointment. This book lived up to my expectations and so much more. In so many series Ive read, the second book was a disappointment but this was anything but that. The story was fast paced without being confusing which is something that I loved. It was almost impossible to put this book down. It was impossible not to captivated to continually read the book. There are so many twists and turns in the book that had you on the edge of your seat all the way until the end where once again it didnt disappoint. Quite often cliffhangers annoy me but this was one that left me an emotional mess, screaming inside until I started the next book straight after at 1am. In this book, I really loved Celaena. Shes a character that I absolutely love reading about and I could never get sick of. Shes a character that is so different from myself but for some strange reason, I relate to so much must be the love of books. You get to see so much character development in this book, not only from Celaena but also from Chaol and Dorian. Seeing these three grow and getting to know and understand the characters even more was something I really enjoyed. There was no love triangle YAYY thankfully because Ive grown to love these characters so much and I couldnt deal with one of those. You get a look at the king and the occurrences around the castle which is great and terrifying at the same time. The story is mainly situated in the castle. You get to explore it depths which is something that I found really exciting and you find out the reasons for events that happened during the first book. During the chapters where you explore the depths and mysteries of the castle, it was impossible to put the book down. These chapters where they unfolded the mysteries that were in the castle were my favourite sections of the book. Overall this book was incredible! I really enjoyed the plot and I loved the characters. The book was not confusing and it was fast paced with was great! I would 100 recommend to everyone, especially those who love fantasy novels. I havent enjoyed a novel this much in years. It is a book that you have to read! I cant wait to read the next book now because this book was incredible! If youve read the first book and thought it was meh, please read this one! It is so much better! I cant stress enough that youre missing out on a wonderful story.
Based on my read and toread shelves, Goodreads kept recommending Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda to me. It wasnt long before I finally took the recommendation seriously and read the book. After having recently read a series of books with predictable plots, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda came as a pleasant surprise. This was one of those stories that pulled me in immediately. From the very beginning, I felt that I was part of the story and when a book does that, it is bound to be awesome. Simon is a regular sixteen, soon to be seventeen year old, and he was one of the coolest protagonists ever. He reminded me so much of Charlie from The Perks of Being A Wallflower because of his innocent, sort of awkward and quirky but friendly personality. He really is the kind of person anyone would want to be friends with. I absolutely loved him. He was adorable and what was most admirable was how his family and friends ended up being just as important as he was throughout the book. What a pleasure it was to meet the Spiers and to spend some fun time with Simons awesome friends and classmates. From the beginning until the very end, this was the wonderful story of Simon coming out and coming of age. For me, the book itself was something like and between The Perks of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky meets Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green and David Levithan meets Boy Meets Boy by David Levithan, three books that I absolutely love. The plot was really awesome and the fact that there was a school play involved made it all the more awesome because its just so wonderful when that happens. Like I said before, as a reader, the story put me right there, with Simon and the gang. The pace was good and the story stayed lovely throughout and ended on a very sweet note. Author Becky Albertalli has written a cute, funny, emotional and absolutely awesome book. The writing was so pretty that if I could, I would highlight every line from it. Oh, and dont even get me started on all the Harry Potter references. It was the coolest part ever, and I loved every bit of it, from the glasses to the costume to the fanfiction. Nothing can make me fall in love with a book more than having Harry Potter stuff in it. Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda was an enjoyable read that put me in a happy and sunshinelike mood, as if having Harry Potter in it wasnt enough.
I couldnt wait to get started on Salt to the Sea , as I had heard so many great things about its author, Ruta Sepetys, and I was super curious to finally read something by her. I have to say, I was completely blown away by this book, I cant even begin to describe how I feel about it. It was very much an enlightening read, but also one that was also completely terrifying as well, and it left me wanting to know more about the historical events that really happened in the story. I seriously had no clue what to expect from this book when going into it. All I really knew was that it took place during World War II. While the novel is completely fictional, it does revolve around a tragic event that really took place during the war. Im not going to tell you what event, Id prefer you read the story and find out for yourself. I keep wondering how Id never before heard of this massive disaster, one of the largest in maritime history, and I am so glad that someone wrote a story around it, because now I know, and it left me wanting to learn even more. The story is told from multiple characters points of view, and while each of the characters come from different backgrounds, we see how the same events affected each one of them differently, yet the same still. I loved that despite the horror, relationships were formed, some with a bond so strong it was heartbreaking. These characters made me laugh, and they made me ugly cry, and I just loved them all so much. At 400 pages, I didnt expect to finish the book as quickly as I did, but the chapters are short, and highly addictive, and I flew through the pages in no time. Also, unlike a lot of historical books Ive read in the past, this one didnt feel like I was reading a history book, loaded with facts I would attempt to remember. The facts are there, but they are written into the story in such a way that they feel like they just belong there, not like they are actual facts someone is telling us about. Overall; Salt to the Sea completely blew me away. There was so much beauty in the story even though the events were completely horrific and terrifying. I loved the characters who found a special place in my heart. I really just dont know how to put into words how much I feel for this book. Its so much, and I could go on and on. I hope that youll read it yourself so that you can understand what I mean. Add it to your toberead stack today, and pick up a copy as soon as you can. I hope you love it just as much as I did. Happy Reading!
Eternal Rider is book one of the Lords of Deliverance series and is set in the Demonica world. While you dont have to have read the series, I would recommend it. In the last book, we met Ares, the second Horseman of the Apocalypse while Sin was trying to save the world in her book, Sin Undone. The Lords of Deliverance series is about each of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Ares is War, Reseph is Pestilence, Thanatos is Death, and Limos is Famine. Each horseman has a seal... its something different for each one. Due to a series of events started by Sin the heroine in Sin Undone, Resephs seal has been broken, transforming him into Pestilence. If any other Horsemans seal breaks, it will start the Apocalypse. A fallen angel holds Ares seal, but Pestilence is going after it as it will be the easiest to break by killing the holder. Cara Thornhart is human but shes got an extra talent  she can heal animals. She hasnt used her talent in years though, since she accidentally killed someone who was attacking her. She freaked out, her relationship with her boyfriend tanked, and she pulled into herself after that. Then, she gets a knock on the door  a drunk neighbor brings her a dog he hit in the road. She takes the dog, pulls out bullets, and he starts to miraculously begins healing. Shes rewarded with a big, doggy kiss. And then all hell breaks loose. arches brow Can you say bonded to a hellhound three times fast? The fallen angel is attacked and transfers the seal to Cara, whos been having weird dreams about the dog she rescued. Now Pestilence is after Cara, and Ares has vowed to protect her. At first its to protect his seal, but as he gets to know Cara, she brings out feelings he hasnt had in centuries  since his human wife and children were murdered and he swore never to feel again. Ares and Cara were a hoot. These two are two of the most stubborn people I have ever met but there was no fighting the attraction they were feeling for one another. Once they gave into that attraction, oh did the sparks fly. I totally was digging on all the horseman, and their sibling rivalries. I do think the upcoming books are going to well worth the wait. It was fun to get updates on the Demonica characters and I am beyond thrilled that she did so and tied them so nicely together. I definitely recommend this book for anyone looking for a little bit of everything. Action, drama, romance, and humor were all mixed within this book and Im sure will continue throughout the series. Ares is one bad ass you just wont be able to get enough of and it will keep you rolling throughout the book. Four and 12 stars out of 5. Definitely.
If, somehow, youve managed to avoid the flurry of excitement about John Greens latest novel, here is a quick synopsis from Amazon: Despite the tumorshrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazels story is about to be completely rewritten. I originally wasnt going to preorder The Fault in Our Stars when I first heard about it back in July. Shocking huh? But I had good reason: I hadnt read any of John Greens books. I decided that enough was enough and hesitantly picked up Paper Towns, which I ended up loving and its now one of my favourite books. Id never particularly been a fan of young adult contemporary literature but Paper Towns changed that. I decided that John Green definitely was worth reading and so quickly bought all his novels, including The Fault in Our Stars. Six long months later, its finally here, and it was worth waiting for. I read it, like everyone else Ive seen, in less than 24 hours. Its a book that deserves a big chunk of your precious time and not only because itll drain you emotionally!. Its very typically John Green in that its wonderfully written, occasionally humorous, intelligent, but also very, very sad. John Green once again manages to perfectly capture the essence of being a teenager, but he does it this time through the voice of a female 16yearold called Hazel Lancaster. The Fault in Our Stars brilliance is mainly due to its characters. I adored Hazel. Shes a fantastic voice and very witty for example, see this typography quote video by Priscilla  The Readables, which actually could be interpreted as being very bleak, but I loved its straightforward honesty. I also loved Hazels unrelenting passion for books. Augustus Waters is also a fantastic character, and a perfect match for Hazel. The journey they go on is both a beautiful one and a sad one, although I dont think its depressing. Its heartbreaking, but not just because its a cancer story. Its down to the brutal honesty about the meaning of human experience and human existence. The Fault in Our Stars is a novel well worth reading. I really, really wish I had ordered the audiobook of John Green reading the book himself because he truly understands the characters he has created. I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books.
Im scared Ill never feel this again with anyone else. I whisper. He squeezes my hands. Im scared you will. LOVED IT! I went into this looking for something light and fun, but this is my third Colleen Hoover book and I should have known better. This was one stressful book! But I loved it to pieces and like usual, could not put it down. Theres just something about her writing that is so captivating and addicting, so hard to put it down and so easy to fly through! Such beautiful writing and story.. The idea of this story with the confessions was so interesting and the fact that these were real peoples confessions is just breath taking, especially when we could see the picture that the confession goes with. In case youre confused, this story follows Auburn and Owen and Owen is the artist of a place called Confess. People anonymously drop off a confession and then he uses those confessions to inspire his artwork. Auburn walks into his studio and they fall fast for each other. The connection they feel for one another is so strong and so sweet. I dont want to give too much away because its more fun to let the story unfold as you go but I will say that this love story is complicated and heartbreaking but of course we had our ridiculously cute and fun moments too! There are some people you meet that you get to know, and then there are people you meet that you already know. The issues in this book are so REAL and Colleen Hoovers characters are always so so realistic that even when I was frustrated with Auburn, I understood her. Towards the end though she started to drive me crazy! But the whole ending of this book and the growth of her and the story was so fantastic. The development was really good and the ending of this was heart stopping! This book made me sad, aggravated, stressed and happy in between. Then the ending was a huge punch in the feels. The way the past and the present intertwined really made the story even more powerful. Such a beautiful and extraordinary love story. You really can never go wrong with a Colleen Hoover book! I love you so much. His voice is breathless and full of fear. Ill love you forever. Even when I cant. My tears fall harder at his words. And Ill love you forever. Even when I shouldnt.
412 stars Why I Read this Book: After reading Motorcycle Man, I wanted more  more featuring this particular Motorcycle Club. What I Liked: OMG  The tension and the angst between Tabby and Shy! I loved every bit of it. I liked that the foundation of their relationship began with a friendship first. Their relationship mirrored Tack and Tyras a bit, which I also liked. And speaking of, I got to catch up with Tack and Tyra. I loved them in Motorcycle Man so it was nice to revisit the couple. The family dynamic here is solid, not only between Tack and Tabby but between Tabby and the club as well. Tabbys fiance abruptly exits the story line but it worked. It stirred up emotions for Tabby and helped her grow as a character. Shy stood up to his Chaos brothers for the name of love. Swoon! Shy stood his ground and let the brothers know what mattered to him most. Chaos is a clean MC and I like that. It makes me feel comfortable and at ease with the characters. Theres no drugs or massivebrutal murders. Dont get me wrong, there is violence but its a lot tamer than what I saw in the first 20 minutes of SOA, and in other MC books Ive read. This is definitely a romance novel first; its not meant to depict the true lifestyle of MCs. What I Didnt Like: A lot of time passed during this one novel and it was a bit hard to keep track of. I dont know exactly how much time spanned over the course of Own the Wind but I believe it was about 45 years. But it gave Tabby time to grow up and mature. Tabby was nineteen years old when Own the Wind started and twentythree years old I believe by the end of the book. Memorable Moment: Your are not leaving. Suddenly, she lost it, throwing her hands out to the sides, she asked, Why? This is why, he clipped, stalked the three steps that separated them, snaked an arm around her waist, drove a hand into the back of her hair, and hauled her into his arms. He slammed his mouth down on hers. Overall Impression: Own the Wind was an engrossing read, from beginning to end. I read all 400 pages in a 24hour period, which almost never happens with me. This is the epitome of book crack.
Oh, this book was such a disappointment. I was fascinated by the premise when I first heard about it, but then I saw reviews from people I trust who felt let down by the book. I decided to request it from the library rather than paying for it. Having read it, quickly with some skimming, Im glad it didnt cost me anything except time and I have to completely agree with those reviewers. Theres a really good idea here and a cool mystery and Id like to know more about whats going on and Im even interested in finding out what happens next. But the book itself, its just not good. Reading it is a frustrating rather than an enjoyable experience. Its just flat. Theres no depth to it, the characters are never really people and lots of hints are given about cool things and never explained or given any depth. Its all a surface show. Its just an idea with stick figures running around trying to make it more that that and failing. Its pretty much fully told in interviews, but that isnt necessarily a bad thing. So is World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War and I really enjoyed reading that. Twice. Once as a book and once as an audiobook. Here, it takes away all personal connection. The story is totally passive, with no active voice or sense of immediacy at all. We know nothing about the nameless interviewer except that hes a manipulative bastard. We get hints there might be something in his past, but nothing is delivered. He isnt even a person, just bold letters on a page  and those bold letters are really annoying if his text is longer than a couple of lines because my eyes arent programmed to be able to scan that and absorb the meaning easily. Theres a reason we use bold text for emphasis, not for storytelling. The other characters do feel like people, but only paper thin ones. All in all, its just terribly, terribly disappointing. Because the idea is still a good one. It could have been brilliant and it totally wasnt. I find that I still want to know what happens next, because that idea is still captivating. But I dont want to have to read through lots and lots of flat text to find out. Right now, Im a sad reader.
OK! OK Colleen Hoover! Just OK! I know, I know. I know what to expect when I read one of your amazing books. I know to expect some tears and all of the feels. I know you are going to surprise me, hurt me, and then put me back together. But I wasnt prepared for this kind of abuse. I just wasnt. I felt blindsided with this book. This wasnt your usual method of operation and I hate you for it. I love you too, but still I hate you. Because you took my sweet unsuspecting reader heart, you held it in your hands carefully and then threw it on the ground, stomped all over that bad boy and shoved it with back into my chest. And you did it over and over and over again. Thats what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them. It can save them. You made me love someone that I shouldnt. You made me question something that I always thought I knew. You made me question wether I would leave. Its a funny to thing to learn that you could be a weak woman while reading a Colleen Hoover novel. The kind of woman you despise. Because she isnt strong enough to make the right decisions. Because you made me love him that much. You made me root for him stupidly. You made me hope he would change. You made me sympathize so badly for him that I thought for sure love could save him. And I am just so pissed about it. And I am damn uncomfortable. It is an awful feeling and I dont like it one bit. Just because someone hurts you doesnt mean you can simply stop loving them. Its not a persons actions that hurt the most. Its the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear. But in the end I had to give this one 5 Stars and that is because I believe in my heart that the author wanted me to feel this way. It was intentional. She wanted to make me question everything that I ever thought I knew about the subject matter at hand. She wanted me to want to stay. She wanted me to struggle along with Lily. And I kinda hate Colleen Hoover right now but I will get over it because I am pure crap at holding a grudge and because this story was brilliant, thought provoking, and heart breaking just as she intended. And I am seriously hoping one day, I wont be so angry about it all. Just keep swimming, Amie
Review originally posted on my blog, Across the Words Id heard so many great things about this book before picking it up so I had pretty high expectations. Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda turned out to be a wonderful LGBT book with a fantastically authentic male narrator. This book is incredibly addictive and its really hard to put down; I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish it and I ended up being super groggy at work the next day but it was definitely worth it! The book starts off with Simon Spier being blackmailed by Martin, a guy from his highschool, about his sexual identity. Martin discovers Simons emails with Blue and threatens to show everyone the emails if he doesnt do him a favor. The rest of the book follows Simons developing feelings for Blue and his struggles with Martin. Simon is definitely one of the best narrators I have ever encountered in a contemporary YA. Hes so incredibly witty, hilarious, and a grammar geek. Also, hes obsessed with both Oreos and Harry Potter. Whats not to love? Simons relationship with Blue is so sweet and just makes you smile. I loved reading the emails that they exchanged with each other. Throughout the book, you witness their relationship grow from being a friendship between two people who are experiencing similar struggles to something deeper and more meaningful. Additionally, Becky Albertalli doesnt make Blue and Simon fit any gay stereotypes; she does a wonderful job of portraying them exactly as they are, which made the book seem a lot more realistic. Becky also does a great job of keeping you in suspense about who Blue is  I tried so hard to guess his identity and even though I guessed incorrectly, I was really pleased by the revelation. Not only does this book portray sexual diversity but it also displays racial diversity. I was really impressed by Beckys ability to seamlessly weave the characters lives together; the relationships never felt forced and the dialogue between the characters flows naturally. Also, I love how much of a tightknit family Simons friends are  they dont engage in much of the typical highschool drama and they are super supportive of each other. If you want a book with a strong and authentic narrator, I highly recommend that you pick up this one. This book is adorable and deals with some very important issues in a realistic manner. I will definitely be reading any future books that Becky Albertalli writes.
I read the Harry Potter series when I was about 10 years old and its what really got me into reading, before Harry Potter I would read a lot of picture books and Star Wars novels, but then I decided to move on to something different, and I heard everyone saying how good the Harry Potter books were so I went out and bought the first 3 books, and I read the first one and I loved it. Harry Potter is a boy whos parents were killed when he was just a baby, they were killed by Lord Voldemort, an evil wizard, who attempted to kill Harry but failed, but leaving a lightning scar on his forehead, afterwards Voldemort mysteriously disappeared. Harry spends the next 11 years with his horrible Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their son Dudley. Until a giant named Hagrid comes to take him to start a new journey at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts there are 4 Houses that the students are sorted into, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Harry is placed in Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat, along with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger who be befriended on the Hogwarts Express. Harry also meets Draco Malfoy who is sorted into Slytherin House, and Harry and Draco form a complete rivalry and dislike of each other, partly because theyre in separate houses, where Gryffindor and Slytherin are longtime rivals. Harry also meets Albus Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, Minerva McGonnigall, Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House, Severus Snape, the Potions Master and head of Slytherin House, who takes an immediate disliking to Harry, and is always looking for an excuse to take points away from Gryffindor. At his time at Hogwarts, Harry learns to use magic, to fly a broomstick, and to play Quidditch, a sport in the wizarding world, and Harry is recruited as the seeker for the Gryffindor Team, as his Father was once a Seeker. Harry along with Ron and Hermione, discovers a legendary artifact known as the Sorcerers Stone, which can be used to create the Elixir of Life, in other words grant its owner immortality. When Harry finds out that someone else may trying to steal the Sorcerers Stone, he, Ron and Hermione take it upon themselves to stop them, where Harry believes the one after the stone is Professor Snape, who he thinks is trying to use it to bring Lord Voldemort back to life. In order to get to the Stone, Harry and his friends must encounter many dangers and obstacles, including a mountain troll, a Threeheaded Dog, Devils Snare, a deadly plant, a live gigantic chess board, and the magical Mirror of Erised. After seeing the first Harry Potter movie it made me want to read the books, and it made me fall in love with the story. I love JK Rowling and her imagination, if it wasnt for her Harry Potter wouldnt exist. So JK Rowling if you ever read this, I just wanted to say thank you for writing such a great series, a great story, and great characters!
First of all Beth, I am so sorry I couldnt put it down after I started and I bumped this up because of you. I am sure by the time get home tomorrow you will have finished and I cant wait to see your review! Tarryn Fisher, you are one damn awesome writer! Dirty Red does not disappoint. The story is so raw and Tarryn is so far in Leahs mind it is astounding. Many questions are answered in this installment and the author ALMOST got me to feel sorry for Leah..not quite but almost, she knew what she was getting into. KARMA IS A BEOTCHHHH! And Caleb....I am no longer sure how I want this story to work out. I really want Olivia to be back with Caleb but I am mad at him who am I kidding, they better end up together and it better be real dammit!. Mad that he was weak , mad that he does not possibly have the integrity we thought, I am sure this will all change once we read his story! Seeing the different povs of the story is fantastic and mind boggling , what you originally felt is validated in this installment. There are so many perfect scenes that refer to book one but I dont want to give any away. READ THIS BOOK! Why are we, the readers, so attached to Olivia and convinced that she is the goodright one? Is it because we heard her story first? Is it because we appreciate how fcked up she is from her past? Leah has a past, do we appreciate it? Do we feel for her? Only a little bit and I still felt myself rooting for Olivia the entire book. Will we ever find out what was in the blue box? And am I the only one that thinks Noah is a slime ball? That would be fitting considering Olivia doesnt usually pick available men. Hearing a chapter from Calebs pov was surprising and implemented at the perfect moment in this book. There were also more supporting characters in this book than the first, which quite honestly I loved. I can not believe this series is not more popular than it is and will be recommending it to many of you! Please to not make us wait a year for the 3rd book! You knew it was coming but: OMGGGGGGGGG
I thought Shade, the first book in the trilogy, was good, but Shift is at least ten times better. This installment had more secrets, more romance and way more action than the first. In a nutshell, it was awesome. In Shift Aura finds herself in an even more difficult situation that before. She has started pulling away from Zachary out of worry and stress about the current shade state of her dead boyfriend Logan. Will all that is going on, even she cant figure out who it is that she loves, never mind what to do about it. As if that wasnt enough, she finds herself uncovering dangerous secrets about her and Zacharys lives through the hidden clues her mother left behind. While the first book was more introduction to the world, the characters and their problems, this book was more expansion on the plot, which gave it extra room to explore. Let me tell you, SmithReady took advantage of that and created a fast paced adventure in 367 pages of pure awesome. I loved this book! Even more so than the first. I liked how the first book kind of makes you think that events are going to happen a certain way, but then this book comes along and erases all of your preconceived notions. Nothing is quite predictable, and I was really glad for that. As readers of the first book know, this series has a sort of mystical, or magical feel about it. Even when nothing paranormal or fantastical is happening, the writing has a way of making the reader feel like it is. It is hard to describe or understand without having immersed yourself in the book but hey! That is one good reason why you should. Soon. Contrary to the ending of the first, this ending almost wrapped everything up. I am really glad that there is going to be a third and final book, since I am not yet ready to part from this lovely world. However, I almost felt like this was the conclusion to the series. There was no big cliffhanger like the first, which disappointed me just a bit, but Im sure many people will like. Each little plot point is pretty essential to the story line, even if it doesnt seem so, so I do not want to take the chance of ruining anything for anyone. So I am going to stop myself here from raving uncontrollably. But I will say two things before I leave you. One, Team Zachary! Honestly, why are you still here Logan? Two, someone please get me Shine!
If you have read somewhere that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reads like a piece of fanfiction, you have read right, because it very much reminded me of something I would expect to find from a fanfiction archive. It is based on a story by J.K. Rowling, but it does not read like a J.K. Rowling novel. Characters old and new are present and some elements of J.K.s stories can be identified, but at the end of the day, the end result is something that has to be credited to Jack Thorne, not Rowling. For nostalgia reasons alone I was desperate to read this. I know seeing the play wont probably be a realistic option for me for a few years, so I was happy that I got a chance to somehow live the story through. Since it is a play, it is obvious that only reading it does not introduce you to all of the magical aspects the stage play most likely has. But at least you know what the play is about and dont have to rely on secondhand accounts and rumors. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child focuses mainly on Harry, now working for the Ministry of Magic, and his youngest son Albus. The play jumps in time quite a bit, so we get to see Albus in Hogwarts for a number of years. Both Harry and Albus are haunted by events from Harrys past, and it seems to Albus that he will never live up to some of the expectations his father has for him. Albus navigates his life at Hogwarts with an unexpected friend and runs into something that has a potential to turn his life, as well as the lives of those around him, very dangerous. While I loved reading more about the characters I had already fallen in love with Harry, Ron, Hermione and others as well as new characters like Albus, I couldnt help feeling like something was missing. Maybe it is that distinctive voice and style of Rowling that is not as present in this as in the original novels or the fact that at the end of the day, this story is supposed to be experienced as a performance. Some of the characters felt very underdeveloped on the page, and there were a few relationships that I wish could have gone into a different direction. But at the end of the day, I am happy for the chance I got to spend a few hours back in the magical world of witches, wizards and Hogwarts and I really hope that one day I have the chance to experience this as a performance.
Lacy Dawn is just a kid. She lives in a poor area, where drugs and domestic violence are common. Lacy Dawn can help the other kids though, with magic taught to her by her secret friend DotCom. Its a kids job to help her parents and any kid who dont aint much of a kid and maybe dont even deserve to live! Faith yelled... Lacy Dawn is in the fifth grade when her friend Faith is beaten to death by her dad. Lacy Dawns own father beats her and her mother frequently. Sometimes even Lacy Dawns dog, Brownie, suffers this abuse. Her mother became pregnant with Lacy Dawn in the eighth grade and now spends her days secretly studying for her GED she has to hide the study guide from her husband. Her dad suffers from PTSD, and uses weed to try and make himself better. Lacy Dawn is smart for her age, but shes still just a kid. Lacy Dawn is special though. Us humans dont realize it, but beings not from Earth have figured it out. Thats why DotCom has been sent to teach her. Lacy Dawn also hopes hell help fix her family. I told you I got extra help learning stuff when we had our clubhouse. You said he was Jesus and I got pissed off. Hes a lot more powerful than Jesus. This book has been described as a laughoutloud book, but I disagree with that. I found it to be very dark. Sure, it has humorous moments, but its not a comedy. The authors categorization is, elements of everyday horror, paranormal, true love type romance, mystery, and adventure. The content addresses poverty, domestic violence, child maltreatment, local and intergalactic economics, mental health issues  including PTSD experienced by Veterans and the medicinal use of marijuana for treatment of bipolar disorder, capitalism, and touches on the role of Jesus. Yes, the book is dark, but its also good. Its wellwritten and it makes you think. Here I think its worth it to mention that the author is a retired mental health psychotherapist. Hes had to work with the sort of people described in his novel, which may be why everything comes across so vividly. Of course, the matteroffact voice of a preteen narrator may also explain that. I found this book to be worth the read, but only if youre in the mood for something dark. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
...and my heart almost burst. Have you read a book where you know what will happen and know that it will gut you but you keep reading because not knowing what happens on the journey to get there would be worse? Have you ever felt your heart break for a character, felt the burn of tears about to spill from your eyes and yet found the moment so sweet that you cant help but smile? All of that and more happened to me while reading A Thousand Boy Kisses and I wouldnt have had it any other way. We meet Poppy and Rune when they are five, and meeting for the first time themselves, and get to be apart of what can only be called an epic love story. Poppy is a light so bright that its blinding and Rune is darker soul with a huge heart and through their eyes we get to experience what it means when you find the other half of your heart and soul and watch as friends become lovers and they navigate the emotional mine field of what loving someone with your entire being means. How the choices you make and the ones that are made for you can affect your heart and how to come to terms with them and live a life filled with joy even when it doesnt seem possible. The highs will make your heart soar, while the lows will rip it to shreds, but each of these moments only show how strong that love is and that it cannot be denied. I would LOVE to go into more detail about all of the moments that broke my heart while making it melt, but not only do I not do spoilers in my reviews, but Ms. Cole as asked that we not, because you really do have to go into this book with an open heart and mind to fully experience the journey that she takes you on and accept that the ending will be perfect for Rune and Poppy and it was. Had I not been at work while reading this book Yeah, bad me. I know I would have been in full on ugly cry mode, and believe me when I say it is an extremely rare occurrence, and as it was I had the bloodshot, shiney eye thing going on as I made myself hold back the tears. Thats how much the characters and story in general affected me and is still affecting me as I write this review. Ms. Cole has an iron clad spot on my very short list of authors I adore, her Hades Hangmen and Scarred Souls series are two of my favorites, and with A Thousand Boy Kisses totally wrecking me, talk about major book hangover I dont see her slipping from that list any time soon. I will admit that I was surprised when she announced that she was delving into the YA genre, but trusted that shed pull out something amazing and she has. As with her other books, she doesnt hold back, even if the subject is a difficult one. She not only gives the reader a well rounded story, but pieces of her heart and soul in the process. The Bottom Line: Do not pass this one over because its YA. It is a must read! Just make sure you have a box of tissues handy and if you are wearing make up that its waterproof.

5 stars! Maybe were like the cherry blossom, Rune. Maybe we loved too much too young and burned so bright that we had to fade out. I dont want to review this book. I want a hard copy, I want to hug it close and just sit there like a crazy person with the book. Because honestly, my words will not do it justice. A Thousand Boy Kisses is one of those books you have to be totally spoiler free to read, I had barely even read the entire blurb  mostly because I trust Tillie to deliver a good book no matter the genre but also because from the very few teasers I had seen I knew I wanted to read this and just feel. Sometimes you just want to dive into a story and feel, let all the emotions take you on an unbelievable journey through this characters. Theres a beautiful thing happening throughout the book that I loved, it was so damn sweet! Write down where you were when you were kissed. Youll have a treasure jar of all the precious kisses that made your heart soar. I read the book in mere hours, literally flying through the pages and falling deeply in love with Poppy and Rune. And yes, I cried more than I ever remember myself crying, Im tearing up as I write this review, its that emotional, and that good. One kiss lasts a moment. But a thousand kisses can last a lifetime. Poppy and Rune become neighbors when Runes family moves to Georgia from Norway. Their bedrooms are across from one another, and the romance is just waiting to happen. Like anything else Tillie has written, and I have read literally all of her books, the romance is effortless. Kiss eight hundred and nineteen was the kiss that changed it all. The kiss that proved that a longhaired brooding boy from Norway and a quirky girl from the Deep South could find a love to rival the greats. It showed that love was simply the tenacity to make sure that the other half of your heart knew he, or she, was adored in every way. In every minute of every day. That love was tenderness in its purest form. Rune and Poppy fall in love from a very young age and its cute to see it develop. They go to school together, they hang out together, they do everything together. Until Runes family has to move back to Norway for a couple of years, but when you are a teenager, even a couple of hours can change your life, let alone a couple of years. Kiss number three hundred and fifty six. With Rune on my drive way when he left.  When Rune returns, he is angry, a different boy from the one that loved Poppy, and he is looking for some answers as to why Poppy cut him off her life when he left. But, OMG their reunion... I cant even put that into words. I love them. I just love them. Words cant do this story justice, just read it and be prepared for a one of a kind story with flawless writing, captivating characters and full of unforgettable moments
I have read somewhere that a good book is one that makes you fall in love with the story as though it is happening to you. It makes you read the ending again and again. This was one such book. For me. It seemed so real, the romance blooming so gradually that made me adore the book. It wasnt a book that went on like Hey we kissed, lets love each other. It was more like We are in love with a thousand problems around us. We need each other. Romance begins that way. Not justlikethat. Anna Oliphant also known as Banana Elephant HAHA is our protagonist who finds love in the place she dreaded to go. Or rather, was forced to go. France! A thousand exclamations. The beginning of the book shows how she struggles to make friends in a place where she is the ONLY one who is new, who does not know French and is all alone. I had my own friends and my own inside jokes and my own stolen kisses. Enter Etienne St. Clair. Ahhhhhh! He is not our regular angst lover, who pushes you to the corner of the wall and makes out fiercely. He is a guy with imperfections. He is short, with buck teeth and wears a purple hat because his mom gifted it to him. He is someone who will not flourish you with diamonds but gives you gifts that symbolizes something. Oh my knees melted at the gifts French name, English accent, American school. Anna confused. No one remembers that I am lefthanded. Whats the worst part? He is taken. Spoken for. And he doesnt come out of the relationship either because he doesnt want change. Well, thats acceptable given the circumstances. BUT didnt you all root for Anna and Etienne throughout?! The vivid description about the historical places in France made me want to book a oneway ticket. No, I am not kidding. Also, our character is unique in the way that she likes to write reviews about classic movies. Awesome, much? Happy Thanksgiving, lets see some dead people. The book is also funny, making you grin all the way. It spoke of family, of friendship, betrayal and love. The ending.. oh god. It was PERFECT! For the two of us, home isnt a place. Its a person. And we are finally home.
Passenger is an exciting and intriguing exploration into history through time travel  I felt like a passenger myself, being tossed in the midst of major historical events and being thrown into exotic geographical locations all over the world! I really like both Etta and Nicholass personalities and I liked how the story switches back and forth between both of their perspectives. So much mystery, with only small clues dropped here and there  this is right down my alley. I found both the main and secondary characters interesting. I could easily identify with Nicholas through his love and attachment to the sea and with Etta as a disciplined professional musician. I appreciated the dynamic between Nicholas and Etta. I definitely want to know more about them and I need to find out what happens to them in the next installment. The ending of this book did not feel much like an ending. It felt more like an abrupt interruption in the middle of a story  as if Ms. Bracken divided her original work because the publisher told her it was too long to sell individually. I absolutely hate cliffhangers. Even in a series. I like each installment of the series to have a miniclimax and a miniresolution, even if some or many questions are still left unanswered. This book did not seem to have a climax, or any kind of resolution. I was also hoping that Ettas violin skills were going to help her to use the astrolabe. I had this brilliant flash of insight toward the end of the book that Ettas mother must have encouraged Etta to master the violin for a reason. This would have been a way to ensure that Etta could use the astrolabe, but nobody who hadnt had a lifetime of violin training could. There may still be a tiein between the violin and timetravel, or they may just be two separate aspects of the same persons life which would be less fascinating. Passenger is an exciting and enjoyable read. Ms. Brackens descriptive metaphors and colorful writing style jolted me into my travels through history and across the globe. I will definitely pick up the next installment in the series, Wayfarer, when it comes out next January. I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. See more of my reviews at: TJs Time Travel Tips 
The moment I saw the blurb of this book I realized this was definitely my kind of book! I love pairings that were completely opposite but always found and share a connection between them. It really never failed to entertain and amaze me. Although I did have some qualms before I started it, they soon disappeared as I found myself being devoured by Echo and Noahs story in a short period of time. This was an intense and emotional read that made me really ache for the characters yet it also had some humorous and swooning moments that made me love them more and enjoy the story thoroughly. Echo and Noah were both broken characters struggling to put their lives back to normal after having such a devastating and awful experience. Both character definitely had my heart out after learning what happened in their past lives. It was emotionally gripping and very raw. The characters problems and struggles were realistic and that made it easier to connect and understand them. Echo struggled on remembering what happened to her that caused her to have that awfullooking scar on her arm. And to top with that she also had to deal with his very controlling father. Noahs, on the other hand, tried to bring back his family together after being taken apart after losing their parents. What happened to Echo was really terrible and disturbing and I wouldnt even be able to imagine what I have to endure if I was the one carrying that emotional baggage. However it was Noah and his brothers story that had me really touched and moved. I just discovered that I have really soft spots when it comes to baby brothers I cried with Kel in Slammed, with Caulder in Point of Retreat and now with Jacob and Tyler. I was touched seeing how Noah internally struggled on choosing which was the best for his brothers and for him as well. His character was so much more and deeper than what he always tried to show. And that made him a very interesting and endearing character. Another favorite character of mine was Miss Collins. I never thought I would describe a middleage woman a kickass! But Miss Collins indeed was! I love how she handled both Echo and Noah and her contributions on making the two realized what they have to do and make the right decisions. This was a really great read. It was a heartwarming and touching story with good amount of sweet and hot romance. I was hooked and I definitely look forward for more of Katie McGarrys book. I recommend this. : Thank you Harlequin Teen and Netgalley for providing a reviewers copy of this book. This review is also posted at Book Overdose
ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK was a book I read on a whim, found amongst my shelves from some long ago thrift store trip I assume. Its a prison memoir about a long ago crime, a year in federal prison, books, microwaves, uniforms, and navigating the social structures of a womens penal camp. I mean, what is there to resist about that premise? Piper Kerman helped smuggle money while head over heels in love with her handler, a woman who would later help stab her in the back. She got out of it, though, and met the man of her dreams and got a wonderful job. And suddenly the police find her years later. A trial takes years to happen and then suddenly wham, shes sentenced to prison, another several years in the waiting. I have never been to prison except for playing softball for two years at a field right next to the county jail Officer Warren, please report to Cell Block B immediately. With Ms. Kermans account of prison life, from mail to strip searches to searching for meaning, I felt like  for a few hours  that I was there, which leads me to my mail complaint about the book... Its prison. Ms. Kerman spends a good portion of the book whining about the treatment she receives behind bars, from having to be strip searched before and after seeing her fiancee once a week, to the hoopla over Martha Stewart possibly going to the same prison as her. If you are in prison, no matter how outdated, it is because you are serving a punishment. Sure, drug offenses on the whole are outdated and the war against... Okay, I am not going to make this a political thing. If you want my political views, head over to Megans Political Views dot Com and see that such a website does not exist because I know better than to mix book reviews and socialist liberal themes. But seriously, her sentence was really silly. Back to the point. If you are in prison, its supposed to be a punishment. Federal prison is a resort compared to county lockup. I know a recovering addict who spent three months locked in a rural county jail sleeping on a mattress on the floor with no outdoor recreation, no access to mental services, no access to NA meetings, having no access to friends and family, all while desperately trying to get clean. It could be worse. Ms. Kermans style of writing is very to the point and blunt. Dont go into this expecting ravishing prose that will sweep you off your feet. But what I really enjoyed about this one was the story and the tales of the relationships Ms. Kerman formed with those around her, and that was what really swayed my writing. Stylistically, this book would warrant a three star rating, but based on the merit of her story and how it compelled me onward to read it in one sitting, this one gets a four. VERDICT: Although the author uses plenty of time to complain about what happened, ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK is a fascinating look into Americas prison system  complete with plenty of Martha Stewart mentions.
Im a big fan of what Ive come to think of as Afterlife books. With what exactly happens after death being the worlds biggest mystery I think that it gives authors artistic licence to really put some imagination into their take on life after death. I found Jess Rothenbergs version of an afterlife fascinating and thought that it was a brilliant idea for the deceased to have to go through the five stages of grief Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Sadness and Acceptance just the same as those they left behind have to in order to move on. What makes this book stand apart from others in the Afterlife genre is that our main character Brie literally dies from a broken heart when her first love Jacob tells her that he doesnt love her. Theres a real mystery behind the book as to why Jacob broke up with Brie when their relationship seemed so perfect. I loved watching Brie visit her old life and go from seeking revenge on Jacob to slowly coming to understand and accept the reasons why their relationship didnt work out all whilst struggling with her growing attraction to her new friend and guide to all things afterlife Patrick. Patrick himself is another big mystery to the book, I was so curious to know why he had been in this inbetween place for so long and what was keeping him from moving on to the other side. The Catastrophic History of You and Me is a book that explores love in all its glorious and devastating forms and is ultimately a unique and quirky romance. As well as the romance aspect to this book, Brie is also trying to navigate her way and learn the rules of the afterlife as well as trying to tie up loose ends and act as guardian angel to her best friends and family. What really impressed me with this book was Rothenbergs ability to write a story that is in equal parts as funny and life affirming as it is heart breaking and sad. I loved Bries voice and could completely relate to her and the mistakes she makes with love. I would whole heartedly cheesy pun totally intended recommend this book to anyone whos ever had their heart broken. The Catastrophic History of You and Me is a love story like no other, with a hilarious heroine, and the ultimate disaster romance this is a story of life, death, love and all the glorious things in between at its best.
Originally posted  CSI:Librarian. 4.5 Stars  By rights, I ought to have finished this book ages ago. It wasnt very long and it was positively mesmerizing, but I just knew Id be beyond sad when I was done and had to leave it behind. Night Circus has a fantastic concept, boundless visual stimulation, beautiful details, and haunting turn of phrase that made for really enjoyable reading. I never felt like Morgenstern was trying to be clever for the sake of being clever. Nor did I think she was trying to make her story overly complicated, which is something that tends to happen a lot in fiction with fantastical elements. Initially, I was a slightly disappointed by the lack of dark weirdness, overwhelming suspense, or really actionpacked conflict. Once I pushed past my expectations, I was really, really fascinated by Morgensterns vision. Her creativity, writing, and descriptions were really exquisite so even if the book wasnt always what I expected, I loved what I was given from start to finish. More importantly and much like the Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab scents that inspired her, Morgenstern created her own unique blend of Night Circus. There were flashes of the sinister, a liberal sprinkling of mystery, a bit of intrigue and a lot of magical wonder. I liked all of the characters particularly Tsukiko, Poppet, Widget, and Bailey. The twins and Bailey sort of stole the book out from under Celia and Marco in my opinion. Some of that I suspect has to do with the Marcos and Celias challenge, the way theyre both being used by two outside, uninvolved players, and again the distracting aspect of the circus setting. Knowing that the circus and what they created for it was meant to reflect them definitely helped me to connect to them better during the second half of the book. Besides, it was impossible not to care about them given their back stories and the way events unfolded. So I was happy with how they found one another and that they found someone to understand them properly. In conclusion, an excellent, thoughtprovoking, and elegantly crafted debut of a novel. I still maintain that the best part of the circus is the freak show as well as the weirdness that can be assigned to its attractions though so if thats what youre after I would suggest taking at least a peek at Geek Love by Katherine Dunn and Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury but only before or after reading Night Circus. Because Night Circus is worth checking out, deserving of the praise it has been recieving, and a book that I would heartily recommend to people wishing they too could visit or live at a magical circus. It might not have been flawless and I wish there had been more risktaking, but Morgenstern told a dazzling, memorable, and marvelous story. And really thats all that matters.
Winter is the princess of Luna and shes also batshit crazy. I want to say its all due to the fact that she stepmother is Queen Levana but its also because she has withheld her ability control people and its taking a toll on her. Going into this story, I wasnt sure how I was going to love her character. In the last book, she certainly seemed more crazy but something happens when Jacin and Winter are together. She almost calms down a bit and I was surprised by Jacins tenderness with her. It was a side wed never seen from him before. Their romance was one of my favorite parts of the book. However, once the action really started rolling, I felt like Jacin and Winter were pushed to the background a little bit. I was also hoping for something bigger for them at the very end. The end has come but Im actually happy about it. This series was more than a rollercoaster ride for me. There were more than just crazy highs and lows, but also plenty of backtracking as well. That was one of my pet peeves with the last book but I think I came in with the right kind of mindset with this one. I knew that Meyer wouldnt go the easy or the most efficient route and that she would like take several steps back once any of the characters made their move. I feel like once youve seen it before, its easy to get immune to it so having the several setbacks didnt bother me as much in this one. However, it didnt stop me from rewriting certain scenes in my head to make it flow a little better. I just cant seem to help it. The resolution, when it came, worked but I also thought that there would be a greater sense of satisfaction. I got the Thorne moment I was waiting for, the moment when he would realize that Cress was too good for him but that he wanted her anyways. I really enjoyed that scene but as for the Cinder and Kai and Jacin and Winter, I was expecting a little bit more. Especially after what Cinder and Kai have gone through. I also would have loved to seen more with Kinney and Iko. There were some sparks there and I think that would make for a lovely story if Meyer decided to write something extra for them. Nevertheless, WINTER was a terrific read that kept me entranced. These characters are so magnetic that you cant help but love them. I have my favorites but choosing between them is hard. Its been a long time since I cared about a group of characters as much as I do with this one and I have no doubt that Ill be remembering them for years to come. The Lunar Chronicles is definitely my favorite series this year. Favorite Quote: Despite everything, she still looked like perfection, at least to him.
A dark and lovely romance, White Hot Kiss was a fantastic YA read. I totally loved this book. It drew me in from page 1 and kept me hooked from there. From the romance, to the surprises in store, this book was brilliant. Layla was a wonderful heroine. She didnt really have a place, because she was part Warden and part demon and those two species hated each other. But, she refused to mope about it and did her best to follow what she thought was right. I really liked her. She was strong, determined, and she definitely proved herself as a heroine. I thought she was great. There is a love triangle in this book, but it wasnt one of those obnoxious ones that get annoying. This one was well done, because it was always clear where everyones feelings lay. I liked both of the guys, but I definitely knew who I wanted Layla to end up with. The romance was lovely. I wont say who it was with, but it was sweet, with some sizzle, and I definitely liked who ended up together. But, after that ending, well have to see where it goes... Zayne was a sweetie. He was very devoted to Layla and did everything he could to keep her safe. He was a genuinely nice guy who only wanted the best for Layla and I thought that was adorable. I really liked him. Roth was also great. He might be a demon, but he wasnt evil. In fact, he could be very sweet. I loved how he would literally do anything for Layla, even face what he feared most. He was wonderful and I adored him. The plot was fast paced and I was hooked the entire way through. There were some secrets revealed along the way that I never saw coming and a ton of thrills that kept me on the edge of my seat. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was horribly amazing. It ripped out my heart, while simultaneously giving me hope and leaving me desperate to read what happens next. I need book 2 ASAP! White Hot Kiss was a brilliant YA paranormal romance. I absolutely loved this book. It was thrilling, romantic, and full of secrets that blew me away. Im definitely looking forward to reading more from this series. Romance lovers, this book is not to be missed. I received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review
I was poking around and I found my abandoned and very mutilated copy of book 2 of 50 SOG and I felt compelled to write this. BY THE BOOK GODS. This book is almost enough reason to castrate the person who recommended it to me  thats a joke, Im not that looney. Why did I buy the first three installments in the book series at once? I dont know  stranger things have happened. Now to the highlights This book felt like someoneI wont name names decided to live their sexual fantasies through a book. And thats okay. I dont shy away from explicit content. Most times, i just skim through it. The thing is, I just think there are some things that are just too fragile and intimate between a man and a woman to be bared out there like that with no furnishing, whatsoever. But, I went on to read book 2which I didnt finish after this. Why? Well, I have a delusional habit, I dont believe in lost causes. But thanks for stabbing me in the eye. Two One and half stars, because a little less on all things explicit, and a little more meat on the dialogue and plot, and this book would have taken fair form..maybe good form even. I mean God! I kept seeing potential; Lost boy wandering in the dark? Come on, who doesnt like a good tortured hero? There was a good concept working in the background there. In the end, Ana is the EXACT example of a girl you never want to be. And Christian  I want to cuss in nonsensical language. Why couldnt he meet a girl with a pitchfork, a sense of pride, and a little selfcontrol instead? I get it, I really do, the heart wants what it wants, but I believe theres something to be said for self respect and dignity. I just think Christian and Anas relationship was unhealthy, not because of the kind of relationship they established between themselves, but because of the way it was portrayed and handled. Outside the playroom, there shouldve been an established shift in dynamic that left room to accommodate a little thing called respect. Most of the things which transpired between the both of them were purely debasing for Ana, in my own opinion. Being manhandled by a guy is NOT sexy. Its not hot, its not smoky, and its definitely not steamy and sizzling. Not to me its not. If you want to be roughed up a bit, Anastasia, go sign up for boxing, and stop being pitiful. In my minds eye, I see this story going another way. CHRISTIAN SAYS: ANA AND THE REBELS SING: Ive come to my senses. I let go.
Oh. My. God. This was SUCH a good book. And there are SO many reasons why. And Ill list a few for you: 1: Its so pretty! Because, guys, this book had pictures! Made with words! One page was actually space and planets and it was so cool that I literally sat there and stared at the page for at least a minute or two. And there were other coolpretty pages. Like the battle. Dont get me started with the battle. Because that page just gave me so many feels. I could feel the fighters fear and determination, and the absolute chaos of the fight. All of this with just one page of words. Its hard to explain, really, but youll get it if you read that page. 2: The spaceyaction! Yes, this book takes place in space! In spaceships! And all of the action both the behind the scenes action and the actual fighting action was in space! It was so cool! Honestly, that should be all I have to say about this point. 3: Kady! Lets face it, this book would not be nearly as interesting without Kady in it. I mean, Im a sucker for badass characters either boy or girl and Kady was definitely badass. Well, not in the way that most people would expect. She couldnt really beat anybody up, or physically defend herself, but, well, youll see for yourself. 4: The bad guy! Or, at least, one of the bad guys in this book. This one appears in about the middleish part of the story; youll know who Im talking about when you get there which, you totally should get there... cough, cough: READ THIS BOOK. This bad guy had such growth and depth to him, and had more than just the label of bad guy. It was just great. Oh, not to downplay the other bad guys. Theyre cool too! But alas, this book was not perfect. You really need to dedicate yourself to this book at the beginning. A lot of information is thrown at you for probably the first 100 or so pages. And its really easy to misunderstand or not catch certain details unless you are paying close attention. Also, I felt that a lot of the characters were sort of underdeveloped. Which, actually would make a lot of sense, since this book is not written from the characters perspectives, but in the form of documents and chats. But, still, a lot of the characters were really onedimensional, and it was a little difficult to differentiate some characters from others because they soundedacted so similar. But Kim, You may ask, why would you rate this book a PERFECT 5 stars when it had these downfalls? Well, because, despite these flaws, I enjoyed this book. If anything, my extra dedication to this book made me enjoy the book more. And I also feel like Illuminae was mainly intended to be an actionpacked book. If there was too much time spent in the development into the characters, I feel like it wouldve taken away from the books fastpaced feel. Still, though, I am expecting more depth in the characters in the sequel. And I cant wait for this sequel!
I dont even know where to begin with this review. Queen of Shadows was such a great read oh my lord, definitely a favorite next to Crown of Midnight. It was so awesome seeing old characters, new characters, and being in situations we have never been in before within this series. I loved all the action that took place and how suspenseful this book was. The plot was so addicting; Queen of Shadows was so hard to put down. Another great installment to this great series and I am excited to see what the rest of this series has in store. Because of the events that had taken place in Heir of Fire, Aelin is definitely now a different person. She is no longer in denial on who she is and really takes her position to do what she has been trying to do ever since Crown of Midnight. I love the character development that has come from Aelin throughout these past 4 books. She has definitely become more mature and her personality has changed compared to the past books Especially Assassins Blade but she also has become more of a fighter not that she wasnt already. She knows what she is doing, who she is going up against, and also has experience on who to trust and not to trust. She has become smarter in her decisions and more clever in her schemes. Aelin has grown from Celaena and I am so excited to see follow her for the next two books before this series ends cries Queen of Shadows definitely brought back and had more of the older characters, whether they had just been introduced in the last book or we have seen them in the series since book 1. But Queen of Shadows also had a few blasts from the past and brought back characters where when I read their name, I sat there for a moment asking myself Who is the person and why dont I remember them. Nevertheless, I loved reading about all these characters and seeing the ways they contributed to the plot. Like I said before, this plot was really addicting. There was always one objective throughout this book and along the way, there were so many great twists and turns, it always kept you reading and never let you put the book down. New information being found out, tragic events happening, there was always stuff going on and things to go wrong and it was always so exciting to read. The ending was something I loved to read as well. It was exciting, scary, and jaw dropping the whole entire them. It left us with clues on the happenings of the next book and answered some of the questions I had since Throne of Glass. It was a great ending, reflecting on all the events in Queen of Shadows and may have left me with a little of the feels, but was a satisfying one. I gave this book 5 stars because it was a fire breathing bitch queen itself. Full review: 
Really impressive! What a lovely book! I was assuming this was going to be another fairytale, beauty and the beast retelling, the typical predictable type. But it got some wonderful reviews from some reviewers that I trust, so I decided I had to see for myself. Glad I did! So every ten years the dragon Not actually a dragon, but an immortal wizard takes a girl from the village for ten years to serve him. The year of choosing is here and all Agnieszka and the other girls of age must stand before the dragon for him to pick one. Agnieszka, along with everybody else is expecting her best friend Kasia to be chosen. Kasia is the most beautiful, the most lovely, the most kind. However she is not the one that he chooses. This synopsis is pretty much the one on the cover and described on all the sites such as goodreads and such. However this doesnt even begin to describe the events of the novel. It is so, SO much more intricate and interesting than this, and I feel it gives very little of the atmosphere of the book and the magic away. So, Agnieszka gets chosen to serve the dragon, I think that much you have probably figured out for yourself without me spoiling it for you. And Agnieszka soon discovers that the dragon is not who she expected him to be. And she is not who she thought she was. You see, there is much more to Agnieszka than meets the eye. Pretty soon she and the dragon are teaming up to defeat the enchanted wood that borders their lands. Yes, the villain in this novel is an enchanted, corrupted, magical, evil wood. And my gosh it works! All of the characters in this novel are extremely well written and likeable. Even the Prince is likeable in a wanttoshoveyourfingersdownyourthroat way. Agnieszka and the Dragon are worthy characters in their own right, but together they are extremely entertaining with the dynamics of their bickering relationship. But the woods... It steals the show. Novik has managed to create an amazing bad guy here, who is not even a person! I think it takes a great deal of skill to pull off what she has managed to pull off in writing this novel and not making it come out corny or stupid. I am thoroughly impressed with her style of writing and the atmosphere she creates in this book. Its dark, mysterious, sweet, clever, complicated and just downright entertaining. There is a lot of action in this novel, enough to keep an action fan like me turning the pages, and a lovely sweet dash of heart melting romance. It had many elements of Cruel Beauty in it, a similar premise and story, but this one was much more entertaining and so much more mature, and didnt have a STUPID LOVE TRIANGLE!!!! Uprooted Verdict? Loved it! 4.25 Stars 
I want to give this 4.5 stars. Why Goodreads? Why no half stars : I was in a huge reading slump that lasted about 4 months when I decided to finally read The Young Elites because it was my upcoming read for an online book club. Well, I ended up not wanting to put this book down at all. It does have a few flaws, as most books do, but I didnt really notice them while reading, it was only after talking about the book in the book club, that I noticed them. When I read a book, I do it purely for enjoyment, so small things dont tend to stick out to me as much. If you havent read or heard of The Young Elites, Im not sure where youve been because Ive read it and I sat around in a slump for 4 months, which this got me out of, thankfully! Basically, the book is about young adults who survived a plague and were marked somehow. Not all of them, but some of them did end up with special abilities afterwards. The story follows Adelina as she discovers her powers, which are pretty bad to be honest, like evil bad, not bad bad. I guess this has been described as a intro story for a villain, because I guess Adelina is supposed to be a villain in the series, but I didnt really see that while reading. She seemed to be more misunderstood and naive. Also alone. But stuff goes down in the end, but despite that, I still dont really see her as a villain. I really enjoyed the writing style and setting of the book, and feel that Marie Lu did a great job making it easy to visualize everything. At least for me. I liked most of the characters, didnt really like a couple, but thats because I wasnt supposed to. At least I dont think I was supposed to. Im really not sure what to write, because I dont want to give too much away. But I did just really enjoy the book and think that you should check it out if you havent already. Its been about a month since reading The Young Elites, but I still get happy thoughts when I think of it. Im pretty excited for the next book because this one ended in a way that I wasnt at all expecting. This was my first experience with Marie Lu, so Im not sure if the unexpected is common with her or not, but I will definitely be reading more of her books. You should too, if you havent!
TaNehisi Coates raw honesty emerges in an essay to his teenage black son about the struggle against institutionalized Supremacy in America. He warns that the American Dream is a lie built on the backs of oppressed blacks that lived in fear and ignorance that scars them even today in the failings of schools, police officers, religion, the justice system, and government. He offers no solutions, only an abundance of beautifully written questions  his voice a cocktail of emotions. He gives readers a glimpse into growing up in a black culture rounded by perpetual fear, struggles of a college experience, and the transformation of becoming a parent. Sometimes it was confusing and other times a fascinating glimpse into a different culture. Part memoir, part rhetorical, part anecdotes, and history this was a short, but intense essay. The essay seems to start out within the narrow confines of history expanding in scope. The last part engaged me the most as I was drawn into his onesided conversation with his son. When Coates goes to Paris and experiences a different culture it gives him a different perspective, his views expanding on previous questions bigger than himself. Or maybe after reading about the extreme fear and violence he dealt with in the beginning of the book, I felt like I could breathe a bit when he goes to college and becomes a parent. Like I said, it is an intense essay. In his travels to Paris he describes feeling outside of the country, looking in. How he is not a part of that cultures dream: I was an alien, I was a sailorlandless and disconnected. And I was sorry that I had never felt this particular loneliness before  that I had never felt myself so far outside of someone elses dream. I live overseas, and it is a good description of the isolation an expat might feel living in a different culture. Coates was inspired to write this essay after reading James Baldwins 1963 book, The Fire Next to Me where Baldwin has a dialogue with his fifteenyearold son on what it means to be black in a country where white oppression has existed since its birth. An excellent comparison can be found in this New York Times article . I now have a better understanding of black violence today and its connections with slavery. The streamofconsciousness writing meanders sometimes, but I have a meandering brain so take that with a grain of wheat. Coates doesnt believe in hope for a better future. Hope isnt tangible enough for him. Instead, he tells his son to focus on the struggle, because the struggle is the only thing that can be controlled. He also insists that the questions matter more than the answers. He challenges the reader in unexpected ways through a harsh reality. A diverse voice that adds to the rich tapestry of literature.
The Law of Moses was such a great story and I got so much more out of it than I expected! She would want me to be normal because she was normal. And normal was so lost to me that I didnt even know where to look for it. Moses has a beautiful gift, he can paint, but he always chooses not the most appropriate things to paint nor the place where he paints. He doesnt have any friends and people are afraid of him because he looks different and he has been called a crack baby, baby born to a drug addicted mother. There is one person who isnt afraid of Moses and is rather intrigued by him, Georgia. Her persistence and her love for horses can draw in and wear down anybody. This is their story about life and death, pain and heartache, forgiveness and healing, most of all their love for each other and others. If you dont love, then nobody gets hurt. Its easy to leave. Its easy to lose. Its easy to let go. After being heavily disappointed with Infinity  one, I wasnt sure what to expect from this, since blurb really doesnt say much either. However, I am glad to say I fall in love with the story, Moses and Georgia. The sad and tragic prologue really intrigued me and after that it was hard to stop reading. In fact, if your brain wasnt cracked, none of the brilliance could spill out. Moses definitely was an interesting and unique character. I was very surprised by his ability seeing the dead , but I very much enjoyed it and I think it gave a story very unexpected twist. I liked Georgia too, especially her persistence to pursue Moses, even when he was an asshole to her and even though her parents told her not to. Also, her passion for horses was admirable and kind of inspiring. I really enjoyed that horses were such a big part of the story, especially where it was explained that they feel the same as the person near them. I dont know if thats true, but that was pretty awesome. Moses and Georgia before were super adorable and after it was heartbreaking to read how they dealt with everything. The scenes with Moses and Eli were so bittersweet, my favorite 3 We cant escape ourselves.. I loved the story, I loved the characters, I loved the mystery this wonderful story included and, lastly, I loved how the author inserted the title of the book in the story 3 Thanks for the BR Jasmine, Sandy and Supreet bummer you didnt enjoy it as much as I did ;
This is the September 2017 AlltheBooksReadalong pick! I really enjoyed rereading this book!! Im super excited to read the next two books now... finally!  2011 review As Posted on TheReaderBee.com. The thing I loved most about Shadow and Bone was how completely unique the book was. I can honestly say that I have read nothing like this before, and I enjoyed every minute of it! The characters were amazing, the storyline was creative, and I was completely hooked to this book. And heres why.... The main character in the story is Alina. Alina is a girl that was raised in an orphanage with her best friend, Mal. Shes a normal girl, never to get a second glance. Until the unspeakable happens and she discovers a long hidden Grisha talent, a talent that no other person has. We see Alina grow leaps and bounds in this book, and we watch as she becomes stronger and more confident in herself. This is the type of character that I really grow to love. Alina and Mal have been together almost all of their lives, from their time at the orphanage, to their time in the military. The more I read about these two characters, the more I believe they are absolutely perfect for each other. Mal is willing to do anything in the world to keep Alina safe. I loved him for that. The Darkling, who is basically the ultimate Greisha, was such a mysterious character. He would also do whatever he has to do to keep Alina safe, but not for the same reasons as Mal. The Darkling has plans for the world, plans that he cannot accomplish without Alina, and he will stop at nothing to have things his way. The worldbuilding for this book was absolutely fascinating. It amazes me how authors come up with these supercreative worlds that I become completely engrossed with. The storyline was excellent as well. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, the author completely threw me a curveball. I totally didnt see it coming at all! These are the things that make for excellent reads! Overall, I enjoyed this book so much more than I expected to. I must have a finished copy of this book to add to my bookshelf, and I cant wait to get a hold of the next book in the series! Happy Reading!
Hazel is a 16 year old girl with stage IV thyroid cancer, and has been living with an oxygen tank since she was first diagnosed at 12. She realizes she is going to die, but she is on a drug that is keeping the tumors at bay. At a support group meeting she meets hottie Augustus Waters, who is in remission. They immediately hit it off and change each others lives drastically. The Fault in Our Stars is another beautifully written book by John Green. A few months ago John made a video on his youtube channel, and in this video he read the first two chapter of this book. I was hooked instantly. I wanted to know everything there was to know about Hazel and Augustus. Im not going to say that this was the most original cancer book out there, but it felt more personal. Lets start with the characters. John Green wrote the same exact character over and over again in his previous books. This is one complaint Ive always had, but you wont find that here. Hazel is no Alaska Young, she is no Margot. Shes just Hazel, and shes lovely. Same with Augustus. Hes unlike all of John Greens male characters, and I adore him. There is simply one complaint I have about this book. John needs to make his 17 year old characters sound more like 17 year old teens than 35 year old men. Most of the dialog in this book and sweet and enjoyable, but then the characters come out with these crazy words and there are other ways to show your characters are intelligent people without always making them spout out these weird, random words. In all honesty its a bit annoying, but it doesnt bother me too much, because I understand that his younger readers will build a much better vocabulary if they pay attention. Also, his book is full of quotable lines as you can clearly see from everyone elses reviews. Ive said it before, and Ill say it again. John is a phenomenal writer. Hes great at building suspense when needed, and also at hitting you in the gut with a healthy dose of raw emotion. Almost everyone I know who has read this book cried. At least a little. He also throws in lots of humor which is usually appreciated to break up sad moments. As far as John writing a female voice for the first time, I thought he did a good job. This book wasnt lifechanging for me, but I easily could see how others could be affected by this book in an astounding way. It tackles cancer, death, loss of sight, loss of loved ones, love, thoughts of the afterlife and shows vividly from one girls perspective what it may feel like to know you are dying. This book may not suit everyone, but if you dont have issues reading about those things I would recommend this book to you. It was quite depressing at times, but Im sure you would know that just by reading the synopsis. 4.55 Stars
It took just the first page of this book to get me hooked,and then it grew on me. Honestly, I wasnt expecting to like it this much. I was just looking for something I could read easily without getting too involved; an equivalent to eyecandy, so to speak. However its been a while since a story lingers with me like this once I close the book and I keep thinking not about what is going to happen next, but about the characters and their motivations and need to know more of their unexplained life stories. Thats what An Ember in the Ashes did to me. It got me right from the start. I loved the title and I loved the opening sentence My big brother reaches home in the dark hours before dawn, when even ghosts take their rest. He smells of steel and coal and forge. He smells of the enemy. And the fact that it somehow resembled Roman Empire was a big bonus but there was much more to it than I thought. In a world ruled by brutal, warlike Martials, the lowly Scholars are forced into slavery and poverty; their libraries destroyed and they are forbidden to learn how to read. Since the Martials took over the Scholar Empire five hundred years ago the Scholars, deprived of their names, are forced to endure cruelty and depravity while serving Martials. However a resistance army has been formed and turned into a problem Martials havent been able to solve despite their violent ways. There we find a Martial boy, Elias a highborn Mask,training to be a killing machine for the Empire and Laia, a scholar girl whose whole family but for her brother has been killed by Martials. While running away and leaving her brother behind at first, she later feels compelled to rescue him and thats how and why the lives of these two converge. Maybe theres nothing new under the sun. Its true theres a little bit of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games and Gladiator... even a light Romeo and Juliet. And of course there is romance, and not just triangles... But it is also about rebelling against the person you are supposed to be, against the status quo and accepting destiny or changing it against all odds. It talks about friendship, abnegation,loyalty and facing fears and duty.And I liked that. And then, theres the end.It is not an annoying cliffhanger but there are many questions you wish you could get an answer to. It could end up like it does and it would be fun but everything is perfectly set up for a next installment we know now it is not going to be a standalone I will be waiting for it because it has been hard to leave that world and Im ready to come back soon.
This review was originally posted at Vampire Book Club. Just go ahead and put Cynthia Hand on your autobuy list now. Hit up Amazon and order Unearthly now, because  and well put our rep on this one  the book is topnotch. Unearthly by Cynthia HandClara is part angel. Shes still new to the whole thing, but when she begins having visions of a boy amid burning trees she knows something is up. Her mom also part angel is so excited, because her daughter is receiving her purpose. While Claras mom wont reveal what her purpose is or was, shell work with her daughter to figure out what Clara is meant to do. First step: figure out where the vision is taking place. Its the second step that makes thing complicated for Clara and her family: move. Any teenager is going to hate picking up and moving away from their friends, but Clara has been assigned a task by God. You cant really shirk that resposibility. Clara quickly runs into the boy from her dreams, and hes stunning. In addition to being gorgeous, Christian is also kind ...and off limits. He has a girlfriend, and, you know, shes an angel sent to probably save his life. Imagine meeting the boy of your dreams  to feel an amazing connection to him  only to continually be told theres no hope and you should focus on your job. Frustrating doesnt being to describe it. Even as she begins to get closer to Christian, she finds another not her type guy grabbing her attention. What if her purpose is to be with Christian? Can can even want to be with someone else? Add in a couple polaropposite friends one who knows way more about angels than Clara does, a resentful little brother, sometimes secretive mom and a popular girl who wants to rain hell down upon the girl catching Christians eye and you can see why being a partangel teenager is complicated. The beauty in Unearthly comes from choosing your destiny, learning to make the hard choices and knowing when your heart should rule those decisions. I love an emotional ride. Good novels evoke genuine emotion in their readers. Great novels more often surprise readers by cultivating the unexpected response. Unearthly appears straightforward, but Hands writing so enamors the reader that one is confused, anxious and exhilarated as the plot coils tighter. At the end youll wonder how this delightful journey brought you here, and start begging for more.
I feel like I want to scream and yell and whoop and jump off of something. Why? Because I have just finished debut author Veronica Roths Divergent. And, its one of the best YA books Ive ever read. For real. The world of Divergent is broken up into factions. Literally. There are five of them: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Everyone in this dystopian society belongs to one of these five factions. Unless, of course, youre Divergent. Then you could belong to more than one faction and youre considered dangerous. And you could be killed for it. Beatrice, the main character, is about to turn sixteen, when she will go through the simulations that will recommend her to one of the five factions. She was raised in Abnegation, but can choose whichever faction she wants. If she chooses a faction other than Abnegation, she will not see her family but maybe a few times for the rest of her life. Which is on her mind. She loves her parents and her brother, Caleb, but cannot stand the idea of staying in the Abnegation faction for the rest of her life. She is sick of denying herself basic pleasuresgood food, wearing colorful clothing, looking in the mirrorand of having to always put others first. When her simulation results are inconclusive and she learns that she is Divergent, she has a decision to make. She now knows for sure that she could enter into Abnegation or Dauntless, a daredevil faction filled with tattooed adrenaline junkies. Once she chooses, she cannot go back. Her life will change forever and as the peace of the five factions erodes into chaos, she will find that her Divergent personality is more of a help than a liability. I dont want to give away too much of this story, especially since its not out until May. But, holy man. If youre at all a fan of dystopian reads, of the Hunger Games, if you need a new Katniss Everdeen in your life, if you love great, dynamic characters and strong female leads then this read is for you. The world that is developed in this book is solid and interesting to think about on so many levels. I can see using this book in my classroom afterall, how long can I continue to teach the Hunger Games when more and more of my students are reading it well before their junior year!.
MORE? MORE!  P.S. I love that book! THE WORLD: The world is just as we know it, except in this book we focus on rich society. We spend most of the time either in main characters room which is nothing special really or on the private island. THE CHARACTERS: So the main character Cady got into an accident a few summers ago and now she is trying to remember what happened. I can tell you one thing tho, Cady is whiny. Like extra whiny. She is used to being entitled so now that she is giving all her things away it is suddenly a big deal. I did not like Cady. I just didnt. Then there are her cousins Mirren and and Johnny. Frankly I did not like either of them too. Johnny plays a super minor role so that is that. And then Mirren is just weird and yeah a liar. She lies for no reason, like I still dont really understand why would she lie about a boyfriend and all. Weird and unlikable. And then we have Gat which is short for Gatwick which is one of the biggest airports in London...hmm...still not over the name. But anyways, the boy is alright except for one things  he is Indian. And that for Sinclair family is a big no no. But he still comes around in summer to hand out with all Sinclairs and frankly, for me Gat was a little bit lacking personally. I mean all characters sorta felt like were there just a props for Cady. Alright, there are a few minor characters in this book too. The first is the grandpa...he is basically an arrogant narcissist who build himself a house on the private island as well as a few more for his daughters and now manipulates everybody using the money. All his three daughters are useless and live of trust funds which of course are running out so they wand daddys money and so they order their children to ask grandpa for things. Basically, none of these people comes to the island for fun every summer. There is no love among them. It is greed for the money and the worst is the grandpa. LOVE: Forbidden love story, nothing new. I was not shipping them. They were just too boring for me. PLUS: If I had to analyse this book for a paper it would be a perfect choice. It deals with manipulations and greed and well basically it is all about family being broken up by money. Sure we have Cadys story but it is kinda a side story when you think about it. MINUS: So what happened to Cady makes no sense to me. Sure the big boom by the end was interesting but when you go back in the book many things do not add up. OVERALL: I think it is a good book which deals with racism and manipulation but as a story itself...I just do not see why so many people love this book so much. I just dont. MORE? MORE!  P.S. I love that book!
A man from Victorian England builds a time machine and travels hundreds of thousands of years into the future. He expects to see all the wonderful ways in which the human race has evolved, but instead finds the opposite. The future world has two races of people  the beautiful and childlike Eloi who live idle lives on the planets surface, and the cruel Morlocks who live underground and only come to the surface when its dark. Hes forced to stay in this new world for a while because his Time Machine has been stolen. Will he ever return to his own time or will he have to adapt to life in this new world? I read this book because one of the categories on this years Popsugar challenge is a steampunk novel and this is the original steampunk about 90 years before the term was coined. Ive never read any H.G. Wells, and I was expecting it to be a bit archaic. The language is set firmly in the Victorian era of course, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. With more than 50 years of Dr Who behind us, time travel seems old hat. But I was trying to imagine what this book would have been like for readers in 1895 when it was first published. It must have seemed amazing. Wells has an incredible imagination and there was a lot of seatbelt suspense. Much better than the 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor. There was also a lot of theorising about the future world and how it could have decayed to the point that our time traveller witnesses. It was also interesting how the time traveller would express his thoughts, only to realise he was completely wrong on a number of occasions. His theories had to keep changing to accommodate new data. Some of the ideas would have been quite political and controversial at the time, as he debunked some negative features of capitalism, colonialism and a society based on the haves and havenots. Im not sure if he was the first to coin that phrase. There were also some interesting ideas about gender roles, though some may see some parts of the novel as sexist. Oh well, it was 1895 afterall. Overall, I enjoyed this book, not only for the story, but also for the deeper issues it raised. Now for some modern steampunk :
This book was so intense, and I loved every moment of it. I love the topic of superpowers, so I definitely was hooked into the storyline of this book. I had to stay up very late to finish this in one sitting, because I just HAD to know what was going to happen. The world building in this book was so interesting. I loved learning about the different supernatural powers and how it related to the class system put in place in this world. This world made me feel like you were in the future and the past at the same time. There were castles, balls, and other regal aspects of this world that I absolutely adored. I cannot wait to learn more about this world and the people in it, because I feel like more of that was needed in this book. What was discussed in this book just made me crave more of this world and what it has in store. Mare was the main character, and I really enjoyed her character. She was strong and fierce, but she was also very relatable. She started off as a somewhat weak character, but her character grew into a very strong character that I was rooting for the entire time. Mare made some poor decisions in the book, but most characters do that. Her decisions didnt bother me to a point that I wanted to smack her. Whenever she made her decisions, she did it with her family in mind and that is what made me really admire her character. I really enjoyed the two male lead characters, Maven and Cal. They were both romantic and swoon worthy in different ways. Maven was more of the shy and sweet one while Cal was intense and passionate. They were complete opposites, but I found myself really liking both of the characters. I actually would have liked more romance in this book. I found this story had touches of romance, but I was really hoping fore a more better romantic storyline woven throughout the book. I am hoping that there will be more romance in the next book. Some of the plot lines were a little predictable, but it did not take away from my enjoyment of the book too much. The cliches were a bit annoying and eye roll worthy. I wish it would have been a little more unique. However, I was still completely engrossed by this book. I am so excited to see where this series goes.

The Lunar Chronicles is getting better with every book. Cress was just fantastic. It has so much movement, from action to backstories, surprises to romance, humor to adventure and absolutely amazing world building. The introduction of new characters has made the overall plot all the more intriguing. I am simply amazed by how Marissa Meyer has interlaced these different fairy tale retellings into an imaginative and incredible scifi story. A very creative recount of Rapunzel, Cress introduces us to a sixteen year old Lunar girl who has been a prisoner on a satellite since childhood, imprisoned by Queen Levanas thaumaturge Sybil Mira. Being a genius hacker, Cress does all the spying and hacking for the Lunar Queen. For the past seven years shes only had her netscreens as company. She is absolutely fascinated by everything Earthen. As a character I found Cress to be adorable. Yes, she is idealistic and naive but that is totally believable in her situation.Also, it was a complete delight reading about Captain Carswell Thorne. He is such a well built persona, hilarious and brave; maybe a bit too selfobsessed but totally lovable. The romance between him and Cress is just so sweet. I also found the desert scenes extremely touching, though a bit rough. The overall plot has really picked up, and the story is moving with a breakneck speed. Emperor Kai is still struggling to save his country from Levanas wrath and he has all my sympathies. Cinder is making progress with her powers, confidence and plans to overthrow the Lunar Queen. We see more of Dr Erland in this book. Wolf and Scarlet have a considerable role to play too and it was endearing to see how their relationship progresses. We are also introduced to Princess Winter, though very briefly and I cant wait to read her story and know more about her. A fair share of surprises and revelations keep coming throughout the book which maintains the excitement. There is a lot of action and drama towards the end and it was really nice to see Cinder and Kai together. I know they have a long way to go, but at least Kai got a few answers from Cinder, who though still conflicted, seems to be a bit more comfortable with her powers and being Princess. I keep saying this, but its admirable how effortlessly Marissa Meyer has built up a massive plot, entwining numerous characters and giving a new life to our beloved fairy tales. Cant wait to get my hands on Fairest and Winter. This is turning out to be an extremely enjoyable and fun series to read.
You may include me into the mainstream category because this kind of worked for me, and I wonder what kind of sorcery got me. Earlier this year, a few weeks after the book was released while the hype is fresh, well, and alive, I went into our local bookstore to purchase the book. Cant blame me. The premise sounds so promising! But then I ended up requesting for the book since the copies of it were not yet available. After I finally have it shimmering in my own hands, the reviews and ratings went downhill and... BLAM! What in the world just happened?! Can I still take my money back? This book has been sitting in my bookshelf jks I dont have a bookshelf box for a long time. Not expecting much from it, the perfect time came, and I was like,time to judge this book that took up my savings! Honestly, the start of the story was a bit off. It felt weird since the characters have unusual personalities. However, I came to realize that Violet and Finch somehow have a strong yet contrasting personalities. The flow abruptly got a little fastpaced, and thats a positive; it got me into my inner beast mode! I read and read and read. Some parts are yay, and some are nay though I can ensure you that the story gets interesting as it goes further. It appeared to be more than just the story of these two sad, pathetic teens. There seems to be a lot of comparison going on between this book and The Fault in Our Stars. Sure there are some similarities, but not too much. Both books have different concepts, but Finch is like a close relative of Augustus Waters. Their personalities are sort of parallel. One reminds me of the other. The thing different about Finch is that he is unpredictable. There are instances when his perspective makes me feel giddy then in a flash, I feel sorry for him. Great thing is that I learned to understand him deeper. Sometimes I think how twisted it is that the other relevant characters in this story ignored or perhaps didnt know or didnt bother to know his state. Maybe that is the books eyeopener. Maybe thats the hole that everyone is supposed to fill if the time didnt come short. Hands down to Jennifer Nivens writing! I liked the wit and the way she crafted the story into something unique. In my opinion, I can say that theres nothing too special to expect about the romance except the characters sugary cheesy lines, which I liked. Times came when the story made my heart twitch. It even made me cry idk if its because of something that happened in the story or because my vacation is about to end lol  even though I saw it coming. Yes, the development of the plot is blatantly predictable. I suppose the thing that biased my rating is the knowledge I acquired while reading this book. I find admiration for the novels connection to psychology. It widen my perception... even enlarged the scope on how I look at things. In the end, it feels quite strange and amazing that a book can manipulate ones emotions and point of view. I didnt spill much about the books content. It is up to you to find out. The thing I realize is, that its not what you take, its what you leave.
I feel like shaking things up a bit for this review, because this is an exceptional book, and John Greens work is beginning to hold a special place in my heart, so Im going to start by telling you how I came to read The Fault In Our Stars. 1. Preorder The Fault In Our Stars in July, despite having not read any of John Greens books. Justify it by saying that his stuff is supposed to be great, plus all preorders will be signed. 2. Read Looking for Alaska in August and immediately add it to my alltime favorites list. Become ten times more excited for The Fault In Our Stars. 3. Skip ahead to December. What? BN leaked several preorders so people are getting early copies? Now Im torn between jealousy and frustration on John Greens behalf. 4. The Fault In Our Stars is out! Why oh why did I select free aka slow shipping in this case? 5. Its here! Its here! Why am I swamped with homework? 6. A few weeks later: I just turned in a major assignment! Time to start The Fault In Our Stars as my reward. 7. Yet a few more weeks later: oh man, I just endured nine straight hours of class. Time to curl up in my bed and finish The Fault In Our Stars because its SO GOOD. Oh, and I need to flag every passage I like, and theres one of those roughly every 5 pages. 8. Two months after finishing: time to record my favorite quotes in the quote book! Wow, I loved this book. I love these characters. I love this story. Can I read it again? Theres a saying in the YA world that once you read one John Green book youve essentially read them all. When I thought about that shortly after finishing The Fault In Our Stars, I could sort of see that. Some of the themes Green tackles in his latest work are similar to the themes in his debut, Looking for Alaska. But then I sat down to record my favorite quotes, because I am bizarrely meticulous in some respects. As I thumbed through the pages of my book, I remembered how much I loved Augustus and Hazel. They are both quirky and intelligent, and I loved the way Augustus expressed himself. I remembered that this book is filled with so much intelligent writing, but that the story felt accessible. The Fault In Our Stars made my heart swell and ache. I dont mean to sound excessively sappy or like a fangirl. Im saying this because I think the reviews that have the most sway are those that contain genuine emotion, and this is the most honest way I can think of to tell you that I loved this book. I hope you decide to pick it up if you havent already.
i have to start this review by saying how difficult it was to find this book i think i searched in about 6 different stores that sold books, then my friends little sister found this book for me and i had to buy it as i was recommended this book at the Penguin Teen live PTA event in Adelaide. ALSO can i just take a second to say i am so happy for all the harry potter references it made me so happy and to find out the main character was a big harry potter fan made the book so much better ! this is beckys debut novel and i can say it was an absolute brilliant novel with a great storyline and very real and realistic characters that all were relatable in different ways. this is my first novel that has had its main focus on a gay character its not like i hate books with gay characters i just havent found a book that it can do the subject justice however this book was real and as realistic as you could get in a contemporary novel. Simon is the main character in the book who is gay but is not yet out to his family or friends but finds an escape through email with blue a person who also at the same high school as simon, who is also gay but he has no idea who he is talking to. This relationship was written very well it felt like listening to a normal teenager conversation. Things take an ugly turn when simon forgets to log of his computer and a fellow schoolmate takes screenshots and begins to blackmail simon which then leads to Simon having to make the decision to come out to his family and friends. I liked how becky tackled and wrote about how guys and girls feel and go through when trying to come out to family and friends in their teenage years and the struggles and fears they have to over come in day to day life. It also looks at how awkward it can be for someone to come out to their family and friends not only for them but for their friends and family. But overall, i really enjoyed reading this novel it made me feel happy and all different kinds of emotions for simon and what he went through. I think everyone should pick up this novel because it does not disappoint at all.
Received ARC in exchange for an honest review Standalone, Suspenseful Baseball Romance with Forbidden elements and a SecondChance Romance I could wait a hundred years for you because the thought of doing anything that brings you pain makes my heart break. From the blurb I didnt really get a clear idea what to expect from this book but I had a couple of plots in mind. However this book did not go those directions. I was blown away by this story, and I fell in love with this book from the beginning. Alessandra is a master in storytelling, and like her other books she hit this one out of the park. I wanted to read as slow as possible because I didnt want it to end. It had something magical to it that really had me addicted to the story. Alessandra has a way with words that hooks you and doesnt let you go. There is nothing I would change about this book. It was just PERFECT! You ever think you could love someone too much? This book is about Tyler, who goes to live with her dad when she is seven years old. Her dad plays for the New York Yankees and brings his daughter with him to every game. The relationship Ty had with the team was incredible. I loved it so much! She is part of the family and knows everything about the game. Her interaction with the players and her dad was just amazing to read about. Tyler crawled her way into my heart! When she is 17, Chase Stern makes an appearance in the team and her life. Chase has a certain reputation that wasnt really a good one. I had no idea if I would like him. But he was so much more and he exceeded every expectation I had of him. I wont go into any details beyond this because it is just best to experience everything first hand. I do want to mention that this book had a bit of a suspense part to it that fit perfectly into the book, and in my opinion added something extra to the story. I have a hundred more ways to make you scream my name and all of them are filthy. Moonshot is one of my favorites this year and it shows that Alessandra is amazing in writing different types of stories. She is one of my favorite authors and I blindly oneclick her books because she just doesnt disappoint. Of course not all of her books are for everyone but she does have very diverse books, I think everyone will find a book they will enjoy reading by her. Ty and Chase are still in my mind and I think they will stay there for a long time. I recommend this book to everyone who loves a Second chanceforbidden romance with phenomenal writing and amazing characters. I hope youll fall in love with this book as much as I did.
Three Things: 1 I really, really enjoyed reading this book! 2 The format of this review is extremely unoriginal. 3 I dont know why, but I really love the cover of this book and am really happy that it ties into the story. Though also oddly disappointed that its not a bigger role. Three More Things: 1 I loved the banter in this book. It was so fun and witty and kept me smiling throughout so much of it. I loved the emailtextingIM formatting and honestly wouldnt have minded if the whole thing was written like that. While I think that shifting to textingIMing made sense, I did miss seeing the email subject lines, as they were pretty funny, too. 2 While there was a lot of fun banter, the other half of the book was pretty heavy. While the banter did a good job of helping balance out the heavy, I dont think it was done as effectively as it could have been. It would be all fun and texting one page and the next was a lot of introspective moments of grief. The transitions were a little jarring at times. 3 The family aspect of this book was lacking for me. While things start to get better by the end, I really didnt care for any of the parental figures in this book. I thought the blended family aspect would play a bigger factor in the story, but it was mostly used to give Jessie one more thing to be upset over. Another Three Things: 1 Jessie is dealing with a lot, though  the loss of her mother, moving away, new stepmother and stepbrother, new school, new friends, mean girls, bullying, absent father. I mean, the list goes on. Plus, shes only 16, so if she spends a good deal of the book feeling sad and lonely and a little selfindulgent, I can excuse it. There was actually a lot of Jessie that I could identify with and even though I didnt always love how she handled something, she was a likable character and she did really grow throughout the book. 2 I love the Anonymous Emailer, Somebody Nobody. This could have been creepy, but Im just going to blow right by that and go for how cute it was. Because it was cute. Though, was I supposed to be surprised by SNs real identity? Because as soon as his character was introduced he was my guess on who it was and I just became more convinced as the story went on. Like, it couldnt have been anyone else. And while I wouldnt have minded if it was revealed to Jessie before the final chapter, I was ok with it. I shipped it. 3 I dont really feel like I can mention any of the guyspotential love interests without giving away SNs identity. So Ill just say, I think you will be satisfied with the romantic portion of the story. Overall, I really enjoyed Tell Me Three Things. It was such a cute story with fun, witty banter that I couldnt get enough of. And while I didnt always think the heavier moments were well balanced, they did seem raw and relatable and in that regard, was well done. This is definitely a YA Contemporary I would recommend. I already want to read it again. Overall Rating out of 5: 4 Stars
True rating : 4.5 stars Cinder is one of those books that could go horribly wrong. Cinder who lives in New Beijing with her evil stepmother and two stepsisters has an unknown, mysterious past. Through her mechanical workshop, she comes in contact with the Prince when she has to mend his defunct Android. In a nutshell, we have a Chinese Cinderella who is a mechanic and a cyborg in a dystopia setting. Could this really compute into an enjoyable read? Yes! It could and it does. I am finding it hard to pin point exactly what I loved about Cinder  the plot, the characters, the magic of the fairy tale spin? Well, yes, yes and yes! I read Cinder in a day. I had no choice. The book seemed to defy gravity, every time I tried to put it down; I ended up picking it back up again within minutes. Lately I have been reading some books that were weighted down by purple prose. This is not the case here. All the descriptions are done perfectly, enough detail so you understand whats happening but so much that you get bogged down in SciFi lingo. This is perfect for me because if we get too many details, it shoots over my head and leaves me feeling frustrated and inadequate as a reader. I kept forgetting that Cinder is a cyborg, let alone a girl from a book, to me she lives and breathes and feels just as I do. Her feelings of shame for what she is are heartfelt. I have often had times in my life where I felt I didnt measure up so I felt instant empathy with Cinder over this. Her efforts to hide her foot as well reminded me of times where I tried to hide excess weight that I used to carry. These two things made Cinder an emotional read for me. So many little fairytale quirks are captured in Cinder, I love it. Its distinctive, fun and entertaining. And even better Cinder isnt relying on the Handsome Prince to rescue her; she is more than capable of rescuing herself. To be honest, I would rather read Cinder than Cinderella to a child, its far more realistic! And hurray for a book without instalove. The relationship between Cinder and Kai is not so much a relationship as a prerelationship. We see a bond building up, an attraction that is intensifying but nothing unrealistic. And as much as I loved Cinder as a character, Kai stands equally along with her in my mind. He has the heart and spirit of a true leader, putting his people ahead of his own desires. The prince and the cyborg mechanic might sounds like an unlikely match but if you read the book, you will know its just right. Does it have negatives? Honestly, yes. Working out the plot is simple, you know exactly where this book is going, and there are no real twists. So we lost half a star. But as I loved everything else so much, that was all I could justify deducting. Finally as this is based on a fairy tale, can we expect an unambiguous happyeverafter ending? Well, its part of a series so I suppose you can guess the answer to that. But when books are this well written, I have no problem with that. Recommended, recommended, recommended!

Three Black Witches are born in a glen, sweet little triplets will never be friends. Three Black Witches, all fair to be seen two to devour and one to be queen Come on, now. If that doesnt sell you, I dont know what will. Katharine, Arsinoe, and Mirabella were pulled apart from each other at a very young age because of their destinys. Only one will live to be crowed Queen of all and kill her sisters in the process. Im in! I went to a signing recently with the author and listened to her as she explained where she came up with the idea and it all started with bees. Yes, bees. And how they protect their Queens and also how when Queens are born they must fight to the death to see who reigns supreme. And voila. Three Dark Crowns was born. Ive been a fan of Kendare Blake since Anna Dressed in Blood and I just love how every series she puts out is different from the previous series released. Three Dark Crowns has all the elements of a Blake novel: theres mystery, suspense, passionate characters, and dark humor. All three girls were very different and all three were strong in their own ways. Kat who thinks shes weak because her body refuses the poisons her affinity requires. Arisnoe who thinks shes weak because shes shown no signs of her affinity and claims no familiar. Mirabella whos always been told shes the strongest and will no doubt hold the crown. These three girls, all lonely, all surrounded by people who use them but also the few who love them. They have more in common than they think yet they believe they cannot survive together. The one issue I had with the book was the little case of instalove between two characters that was really over done and made no sense I hated it and I hope that it goes away, but I have a feeling it wont because of the way it ended. This book is not for everyone. Theres not a lot of action and the pace is slow. Its a book setting up the events to come and introducing us to the characters in depth. With that out of the way, and that freaking ending, I cannot wait to see what Blake has in store for the next one!
After reading Uprooted for the second time this year, I still stand firmly behind my opinion that this novel is one of the best that Ive read in the genre. This isnt one of your innocent YA fantasies which are basically some ridiculous love triangle with a hint of something that resembles fantasy worldbuilding. It has length, the author has given much effort to worldbuilding and the magic system, theres a typical medieval setting with a bonus of blood, gore and scary stuff. The only thing that I wouldve appreciated more would be a map at the beginning to show us the true size of the corrupted Wood. Perhaps it was in editions other than the one I had. The thing that I enjoyed the most was that the motivation our heroine for acting was her love for her best friend and her drive to save her. Agnieszka isnt perfect and she admits to being jealous of Kasia. She isnt a typical main character that cant make mistakes. She makes them often but she takes the blame. The author borrows a lot of her ideas from Slavic folklore, which isnt very common in fiction. Other than vampires, the creatures from Slavic mythology arent very popular. Here we have a different version of the old story of Baba Yaga, which is usually depicted as a fearsome witch with chicken legs and iron teeth, but instead, she is a powerful forest witch who helps people and whose spells and charms have a homely feel. Also, the names of all of the characters are Polish. Being Slavic myself, its a refreshing sight after reading many western novels that have mostly Anglophone names and mythology. Other than that, the writing style is very fluent and easy to read even though the fact that the author used the word vomited more than I was comfortable with; I really hate that word and I wasnt able to notice any major plot holes. The characters were very lovable, if not relatable because there isnt a lot of character growth. The romantic relationship between Sarkan and Agnieszka wasnt explored enough. It felt like the author added it to the story just because it was expected, as this is a retelling of the classic Beauty and the beast in a way, and not because she wanted them to fall in love. There will be a film adaptation of Uprooted in the years to come and it will be produced by Ellen DeGeneres, which is pretty exciting.
Todd Hewitt is only a month from his thirteenth birthday; his first day of his thirteenth year, signalling the day he becomes a man of Prentisstown. In Prentisstown Todd is the youngest. Years before the spackle unleashed germ warfare against the human population, killing all the women, and causing the Noise  every man, creature and things thoughts to become audible. But when Todd comes across a patch of silence one day, his entire life changes in a minute. Soon Todd is on the run and discovering that everything he ever knew is a lie. Wow. Where do I begin? Perhaps at the beginning? I picked up The Knife of Never Letting Go because the title captured me completely. I wasnt expecting the captivation to take such a full and complete hold on me as I discovered the wonders of Patrick Ness writing. The prose is almost impossible to describe. As Ness pulled me into Todds narration I felt myself propelled forward through the story by sentences running into one another, emulating Todds fervent energy, fear and adrenaline. At other, quieter more poignant times, the prose broke down into short sentences, each beautifully written turn of phrase like an echoing pang in the chest. For the most part, stories draw me in, make me laugh, cry, hate, love... but more often than not only ever in a superficial way. However, The Knife of Never Letting Go truly moved me. I fell in love with the characters like they were my best friends; I was astounded by the science fiction of Ness universe as if I were discovering it along with Todd and Viola; the novel enveloped me so completely, I triumphed at Todds moments of triumph and my heart ached when Todds was broken. This is a novel about choosing to be the kind of person youre going to be, the pride, principle and honour that comes with that choice. And how sometimes we choose to become something we swore we wouldnt if it means taking care of the people we love. This a coming of age story like no other. And if you want action, adrenalinerushed scenes, charming and funny narrative, characters so real you would swear you knew them, and writing so beautiful it almost hurts, then you MUST read The Knife of Never Letting Go. 10 STARS! It knocks right out of the 5 rating stratosphere.
Hello Reading Slump, old friend, I welcome thee with open arms...Because I know Ill have a hard time picking up other books after finishing this one. Edit September 14th: Well, my futureself can affirm that there was no reading slump, and Ive moved on with my life just fine. So I conclude that this book while the best in the Throne of Glass series still come second after A Court of Mist and Fury, just wanted to throw that out there...and that the real world still sucks in comparison to the fantastical worlds Maas created.. The epicness level in this book has blown out of proportions, every few chapters theres a confrontation or a battle each more desperate than the one before and each would leave me with a couple more grey hairs. The plot is woven way more intricately than the previous books, with lots of twists and turns, and finally some major plot points have been revealed. And that bloody ending, hit right in all the major arteries! Yes, definitely best book in this series. Now on to the characters: Aelins character was solid, but nothing for me to wax poetics about because the book does that already quite enough, thank you very much Everything comes easily to her, all her secret plans comes to fruition in the most dramatic ways, she has a solution to everything, blah blah blah... Nevertheless, some parts really hit my feelings quite hard especially nearing the end, so Im cool with her. Manon, you wonderful magnificent bossass witch, I loved her since she first appeared in Heir of Fire, and I didnt believe that I could get attached even more to her, but in this one she really shined. Another badass lady that deserve some acknowledgment is Lysandra; not only shes a force of nature but she has such a wonderful personality that you cant but cheer whenever shes around. Elide, my little illiterate Slytherin Hermione Granger, damn that girl is smart and cunning. She intrigued me in Queen of Shadows, but one chapter of her point of view in this book and she quickly became my second favorite after Manon. Moving on to the male leads, Dorian and now, Lorcan are definitely my two favorites; their inner struggles and the tremendous growth that their personalities undergo was the most interesting thing to read about after Manons of course... what? IM A MANON GROUPIE!. Rowan, well, hes started off as kinda meh, Im not the biggest fan of his relationship with Aelin and they were really gross in the beginning. I just wanted to scream at them to GET A ROOM!, then I wished I didnt because when they got into that room...oh boy! Love scenes straight out from Outlander quite literally in the case of a sentence or two, so be warned, this series has left YA Land. Where was I? Oh yes Rowan, he finally grew on me by the end of the book as his own character, and Im looking forward to follow his arc. Finally, Ive been moaning about not shipping anyone in this series and just reading for the fun of its fantastical elements and the great characters coughMANONcough, but in this book...Im suddenly shipping every single freaking ship! Well except for the main one, but holy mother the rest of them! Each different and each with its own nuances... My heart is sold!
As I finished reading this second book in the series, I was bitterly reminded that it would be a year before I knew what would happen next. This second book was amazing with love, hate, conflict, and deviousness. Sometimes you think you know one thing and actually you know only one small bit of what is going on. Feyre is so complex. She has faced Amarantha and won while she became less enamoured with the prison she found herself living in. When she finds the opportunity to blossom she totally blooms. She finds that she did not like her prison of the perfect faeryland castle and the doldrum of painting and waiting to be included in anything that might stimulate her mind. When Rhys comes to her and takes her with him for the agreed upon time, it all turns amazing. Rhys shines as a wonderful, kind, considerate, harsh, noble, High Fae. He captured my heart and then with the banter, the joy, and the sexiness he captured Feyres. Rhys is not the fae that we expected under the mountain. He is so much more. I can not tell you how engaged I was throughout the entire book as Feyre and Rhys became closer and closer. Always learning, teaching, and sharing these deadly adventures with only the best intentions as a reason. The coming wars were looming and making things tense and strained and Feyre took it upon herself to learn to be the best part of their group as she could. She shined in her willingness to be a strong member of his court. Not a plaything and a pretty bauble in his court as she had been in Tamlins. I admit I liked Tamlin in the first book as he sheltered her and took care of her family in such an over the top manner. It hurt when he became obsessive and controlling. This book fixed all that hurt. It repaired my somewhat bruised heart and brought in the big gun, Rhysand. This is a must read. I can not wait until the next book comes out. I mean the stage has been set for the next book and I am ready for it now. THis is one of those books that hold on to you for a while after you finish it. I am still going over bits and pieces now that they all fall into place. Well written, with vivid images and wonderful conversations. There is humor interspersed with teasing banter. There is a group of friends that work together for good. Secretly working together for good and Feyre thrives in this environment. I have found myself crying at several scenes in this book with my heart wounded and broken for the people I was falling in love with The characters all are amazingly well told. Their personalities clear and unwavering. Now I wait for book 3.
4.5 STARS Wow, I really liked this book a lot more than I originally thought. I will admit it took me some time to get into this story, for the first 60 pages I wasnt really feeling it but it quickly picks up after that. Lilac and Tarver are very interesting characters and I adored watching them go from enemies to lovers. There are only a few nitpicks I have when it comes to the story, which is why I knocked it down half a star. The first thing being: I thought this story would take place entirely in space. The cover is kind of misleading in that way. Only the first 60 pages happen in space, then the rest takes place on an abandoned planet in the jungle which I didnt mind I was just expecting it to take place in space. The second thing is that the ending kind of confused me a little. Maybe this is just me personally but I found it very hard to keep up with what was happening and found it very difficult to understand exactly what was happening in the last 50 pages or so. Anyways, now that Ive gotten that out of the way, I really loved this book. I thought it was slow in the beginning but as soon as the Icarus crashes like the Titanic and its just Lilac and Tarver, I really loved watching their characters grow and develop. Lilac has pretty much done a 360 during this book. She goes form royal princess wearing her heels and her big ass dress so being a badass who is prepared for survival. I loved how Tarver taught Lilac all the ways of survival that he learned through the military, and learning about Tarver and Lilacs back story and why they are the way they are. I also loved reading about the paranormal aspects of this book and found it to be quite creepy and scary. I was reading this till 3am last night because I couldnt put it down and some of the creepy paranormal stuff is scary to read when you are laying in darkness. This book kind of reminded me of the tv show Lost at some parts, especially with how confusing the ending was for me hahaha. But this book was creepy, amazing, and intense in all the right ways! Overall, I was easily caught up in the romance, the suspense, and the mystery that this book offers! I was very impressed with the writing style and the pacing. Its one of the most original story ideas Ive ever read. I think my favorite part of this story was Tarver, he is just so sweet and he genuinely cares for Lilac and he has impressive survival skills. Hes just the full package. The only thing I would change about this story if I could would be the ending. Not necessarily the way it ended, but just explain more in simpler terms what is going on so it doesnt leave me feeling so confused. Other than that, this book was amazing.
The Keeper: 3.5 Stars It was interesting reading from Michelle Benoits point of view, especially since we didnt really get to hear too much from her, just about her, in Scarlet. Glitches: 3.5 Stars If its possible to dislike Adri any more that I already did, I do. Thats probably why I didnt like it as much as some of the other ones in the book. She and Pearl always annoy me and listening to how awful she is to Cinder isnt what I want to read about. The Queens Army: 4 Stars Wolfe was always one of my favorite characters, and so it was extremely interesting to hear what his life was like a little before joining the Army. The part at the end of it where he was going against Alpha Brock was very intense! Carswells Guide to Being Lucky: 5 Stars I love Thorne. I wish Thorne was real so much! His personality, his attitude, everything about him is the best! And hearing about his life way before Cinder and the gang was extremely interesting. It makes you love him even more. I love that he wanted a real cat, but he was okay with his android cat Boots. After Sunshine Passes: 3 Stars Im not a fan of Cress until she starts to stand up for herself in Winter, so listening to a part of the story where she is a scared, quiet shell again is hard. I mean, I definitely understand why shes naive, but it is annoying. The Princess  the Guard: 4 Stars Aside from Thorne and Cress, Winter and Jacin are my favorite couple. It was heart breaking listening to how everything has effected her: the death of her father, saving the servant, the servant dying, still recovering from the loss of Celine, thinking she lost Jacin, and suffering from Lunar Sickness. This girl needs a hug! The Little Android: 2 Stars I just didnt care for this one. I guess because Cinder only played a minor role in it, and none of the other characters mentioned were people Ive read about, so there was no connection formed. It just wasnt my thing. The Mechanic: 4 Stars I loved hearing Kais opinion of Cinder from first meeting her! It sounds like they have always meant to be together, even before they knew it! Something Old, Something New: 5 Stars What can I say? Im a cheeseball when it comes to weddings! I am so happy that Scarlet and Wolfe got married. I feel like out of all the couples, they deserve it. I mean, I love all the couples together, but I think Cress needs to live some more before her and Thorne get married, and Winter and Jacin need some time of Winter not being crazy before they get married. And Kai and Cinder have been busy running their own countries, so I totally get them not being married...yet. It was so wonderful to go back to this world and read about some of my favorite characters! I loved them so much!
Buy this book HERE on Amazon or buy this book HERE on BookDepository with FREE WORLDWIDE SHIIPPING I received a finished copy of this book from the publisher HarperCollins Katherine Tegen Books for free in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own. 2.5 of 5 stars Please read my rating system further below. My preconceived notions about my feelings on the plotoutcome of this book could not have turned out more different than what happened with The Things You Kiss Goodbye. I remember reading the synopsis of this book and thinking to myself that this book would be a great fluffy and easy read; I could not have been more wrong. When I started The Things You Kissed Goodbye I was in a little bit of a reading slump, and it was hard for me to engage myself into the story when I first started reading. I would read the first chapter over and over again because I just wasnt feeling the story. After a few days of not reading, I finally continued on into the story, and found myself in this limbo zone where I was flying through pages and almost enjoyed the story, but it almost too brutal for me to continue reading. What I mean by this is that Bettinas boyfriend Brady was inhumanly abusive of her, and this was really hard for me to take in because of my belief in non abusive relationships. I would find myself literally looking away from the page while reading because it was too much for me. Im really glad that this only lasted for a period of time because Bettina met Cowboy. What bothered me about Bettina and Cowboys relationship was how naive Bettina was about him. I definitely liked Bettina and Cowboys relationship much more than the one she had with Brady, but dont you think a girl should ask a guy whats his name before falling in love with him? Nonetheless I did end up loving their relationship and was really devastated by the ending of the book. I also really liked how Bettina was of Greek heritage; this made the book really unique and relatable to to because of the strong culture and tradition that Bettina grew up with. My rating system: I do use half stars. 5  I do not use the 5 star. Not because a book might not be worthy, but because a book is never perfect. 4  I loved it! There werent too many flaws, and I had no trouble getting through it. A 4 star rating is the highest rating Ive ever given a book. 3  I enjoyed the book, but there were flaws that made me enjoy it less. 2  I finished the book, but there were too many flaws for me to enjoy it. 1  I could not finish the book, and I probably did not finish it....
Ive loved everything Ive read by Liane Moriarty, and this book was no exception. She always manages to surprise me in at least one way, and I enjoy her stories and her writing style. Big Little Lies is a story of friendship, secrets, and mystery, with a few social issues tossed in for good measure. Its the story of a group of kindy mums and their relationships with each other, their spouses, their children, and members of the community. Its a story about bullying, about abuse, about how little we know about our friends and neighbors. In short, its a fairly realistic portrayal of life as a mother. I enjoyed the entire book immensely, and it was so far one of my favorites of 2015. Lots of plot spoilers ahead  proceed at your own risk! Throughout the book, I was never sure if Ziggy was telling the truth about not bullying Amabella. I suspected he was, but his refusal to talk about the allegations when his mother questioned him did make me wonder. I suspected early on that one of the twins was the real culprit, but since they were rarely described, I couldnt tell for sure. In the ladies discussions about the murder incident, I really thought up until the end that Madeline was the victim! There was so much talk about the fighting among the moms and the drama around the bullying that I was convinced something related to that had escalated and Madeline had wound up dead. I was surprised and a little relieved to find that it was Perry who was killed. It was hard to read the scenes with Celeste and Perry. Ive known many women who were or are in abusive relationships, and Celestes behavior and mentality were very familiar to me. Its always incredibly sad to see this kind of rationalization Its not his fault, I deserved it; I shouldnt have done xyz and it was heartbreaking when Perry found out about the apartment. I knew she wouldnt really leave him at that point, that she wouldnt have the strength. His death definitely set her free, and I was relieved that she had a chance to start over. I didnt expect Perry to be Ziggys father. I thought perhaps Saxon and Perry were just similar, since they were related. I thought maybe they grew up with the same kinds of role models. Im not surprised that Perry would have cheated on Celeste, though. Its just another of his faults to add to the list. Im not a mother and Ive certainly never raised a teenager, but I felt so bad for Madeline! Abigails behavior was so hurtful! I hope I never have to deal with that kind of situation. I thought Madeline could have been more assertive with that situation, since she was with everything else. I wondered why she fought so much for Ziggy when she wouldnt really fight for Abigail. It seemed a little bit out of character, but I was glad that after the website debacle she regained her backbone re: Abigail. I would definitely recommend giving this book a try!
5 Calendar Alarm Stars Set your alarm people. Its November 9. The date that has become the most anticipated of the year. Forget July 4. Dont worry about Jan 1. Skip right over Oct 31 and head directly to November 9. Its no secret I think Colleen Hoover is incredibly talented. I am a huge fan of hers. She is constantly breaking the rules. Making her own rules. So for the past months I have been anticipating this one. Waiting...... I have this weird quirk. When I trust an author is going to give me a great book, I dont want to know anything about it. I dont even read the synopsis. So I had NO idea what November 9 was about. None. I like it that way. Complete surprise. So not disappointed. You know I dont do spoilers....so just know my feelings were all... I dont want to give you too much information because there is very little I can tell you that is not a spoiler of some kind. Fallon and Ben meet and have a connection. Unfortunately, they arent going to be in the same zip code for too many more hours. Ben and Fallon each need to answers to the big questions in their lives. Both need to know they are more than their past. Their scars. Inside and out. I forget all things. Everything. I forget where I am. Who I am. November 9 is about finding yourself. Again and again. The choices you make and who you make them for. In a perfect world, Fallon and Ben would have it easy. But they both know thats not their world. This is real life, and in the real world you have to bust your ass for happily ever after. This is Colleen Hoover, so of course there are more quotable quotes than pages. She knows how to put words together like none other. I thought I was stronger than a word, but I just discovered that having to say goodbye to you is by far the hardest thing Ive ever had to do. So many freaking goodbyes. I loved this book for many reasons. One is that the characters read the same books I read. And the same cliches. And have the same reactions. Another Love It is that I thought I knew where this was going. Like I said...Ive read lots of book. I know the formula. But silly me. I forgot I was reading Colleen. So I was wrong. And surprised. So gloriously surprised. So take my advice. Read this book. Then you can set your calendar alarm for the next release. That gives you lots of time to try to figure out what the hell happened in this one.
Obsidian is nothing like you would expect. Now I dont normally read anything that has to do with Aliens, but since I am familiar with Jennifer L. Armentrouts previous book, HalfBlood, I knew that I had to read it. Armentrout just has a way with words and will make you feel a part of a story. Kat is a character that I think everyone will easily connect with, especially book bloggers all around. She is a blogger who reads and reviews books. I really liked that the author added some parts about the blogging world and some of things we do on our blogs. It was very easy to relate to the main character this way. Kat was also smart and amusing. When she meets Daemon for the first time, it was like I entered in to a big box of sexual tension. You can tell immediately that Kat and Daemon have a thing for each other. Daemon tries his best to keep Kat away from him and his sister, but soon realizes that keeping Kat away is a lot harder than he counted on. So he decides he will just push all of her buttons and make her not want to be around them. But Kat refused to be bullied and the more he pushed, she pushed back. It was very entertaining lol. Their relationship had me laughing out loud throughout most of the book. It was a lot of bickering and teasing and I wanted to jump into the story and make them kiss already! They had so much chemistry that it was practically coming off the pages. Daemon and Kat were great together and I loved every single second of their relationship. I didnt doubt for a second that I would love this book, and I was right. Its very entertaining and fast paced. When I hear the word aliens, I think space ships and weird looking creatures, but Obsidian wasnt like that at all. It was a lot more modern than I thought it would be. Daemon and his sister do come from a different planet, but they are nothing like you would think. Jennifer Armentrout came up with a really unique idea and pieced it together really well. I loved the characters and I loved the way the story started and ended. The only thing I wish were different was that Daemon and Kat admitted their feelings for each other a little sooner in the story, but the wait was worth it and made up for it. Obsidian is definitely a mustread, mustbuy! 5 out of 5 Stars!
Ill admit, I wasnt particularly excited about the Dark Artifices. The Infernal Devices will always be my favourite book series, and nothing would ever compare, but I bought the first book in the series, Lady Midnight, nonetheless. I loved it, every page, every character, almost every brilliantly written line. The fact that it was based around one of my favourite poems, Annabel Lee by one of my favourite authors: Edgar Allen Poe, was even better. Warning: This review contains spoilers. I absolutely loved Mark Blackthorn and his relationship with Kieran, the wildness about him from having spent years with the Wild Hunt, how he didnt quite know what do with himself when he was returned to the Shadowhunter world, didnt know how to be a Shadowhunter and how there was that unfailing hope that he would one day return to the Wild Hunt and the faeries instead of be with his family, his brothers and sisters who missed him and needed him there. But he stayed with his family, and even though he had left Kieran, the sense of being in a world where freedom reigned in the Wild Hunt, where there were no cruel Shadowhunter laws, just because in the end, he realised that was where he truly belonged...that he was a Shadowhunter.... The cliffhanger ending, which I wont spoil too much. Emma and Julians parabatai love. They didnt wait ages like Clary and Jace. They knew they were in love, they knew their love was forbidden, and yet they chose not to deny it, they chose to be together even in secret, at least until the end. I really liked the appearance of all the other characters I loved from the Mortal Instruments and the Infernal Devices: Jem and Tessa especially, Simon and Izzy getting engaged, Clary, Jace and his uncanny wit and humour, Alec and Magnus adopting a warlock son... I felt for each of the Blackthorn, too, especially for Tiberius for being different and unlike the others and how this is going to probably pose as an issue for him because the Clave Shadowhunter government doesnt approve of Shadowhunters being different in the mind...Julian and his heavy burden of having take care of the rest of his siblings because his parents were dead, Emmas revenge and intent on finding the killer who murdered her parents five years ago and then discovering who it was all along... I especially liked the dark magic in it, the introduction of the Scholomance, the love story between Annabel and Malcom Fade, the warlock of the LA Institute, who resorted to evil and dark magic just to bring back someone from the dead long ago who was buried alive in a tomb, in a kingdom by the sea... Overall, I was impressed with the book and really looking forward to the next one, though Ill most likely be waiting another two years..
Actual rating 3.5 In a nutshell: A reality tv show turns horrific for a contestant pegged as a fan favourite, who the producers refer to as Zoo. Recommendation: If youre into post apocalyptic stories, you should give this one a chance. Its a quick easy read, yet it is not easy to put down. This one was a monthly read for one of the groups on Goodreads Im part of. So I read it, and I was expecting to be disappointed, but this was a pleasant surprise. The first one on the production team to die will be the editor. Zoo is a contestant on a survival type of reality game show. Pegged as a fan favourite by the producers, she is reasonably calm and collected in her strategy to win. She plans to win the prize money and go home to have a baby with her husband. Soon she is tested beyond her wildest imagination, but reminds herself that it is only a part of the game... or is it? Something has gone wrong in the real world outside of the tv show, but Zoo does not know this. This book is quite original in terms of post apocalyptic books. Its not your usual zombies or worldwide epidemic sort of thing. It is a post apocalyptic book in which the main character doesnt even KNOW what is going on. Or rather, she believes she does but doesnt. The book flips between the present situation for Zoo, when these terrible things have actually happened, and the recent past when Zoo was among other contestants completing challenges for rewards to help them survive in the wild. The book is written simplistically so it is easy to understand and to follow. A common flaw with these types of books is that I often find that they are too scientific. This happened because of this type of gene sort of thing. This book doesnt have any of that and that keeps the story fresh and interesting. The side characters are all equally interesting and I found myself really into the other contestants too, as if I were actually watching the tv show. You dont have to remember a bunch of names either because each contestant is just given a nickname that corresponds with a personality trait, job, or some other aspect of their life. So why didnt I give this four or five stars? Well, for two reasons. The main character wasnt that likable or interesting, only the circumstances she is in are, and at times you wonder how can she be THAT clueless? The other reason is that the ending could have been better. Still, overall this book was pretty solid and I enjoyed it.
Imagine if you will, a world that is on the brink. God has turned his back on the people he created, leaving them to fend for themselves. Every soul on Earth is at the mercy of a Heavenly War. One side is set on creating the Apocalypse, the other side on preventing it. Callahan and LaLaurie have just stumbled into one of the biggest and longest standing battles in the history of the world, and as a reader youre along for the ride. Sound intriguing? I guarantee you, it is. Meet our fearless team. Sebastian Batty LaLaurie is a bibliophile, theologian, and John Milton fanatic who also happens to have a drinking problem. His past is dark, and littered with secrets. Then theres Bernadette Callahan. Section agent, massive cynic and all around badass woman. She might be nearing a collapse, but shell be damned if shes going down without a fight. These two characters drive the story forward as they take off, across the globe, gathering clues. Murders, sacred relics, and musty archives are just some of what youll find as you join their journey! Its tough not to be immersed. What I loved most about The Paradise Prophecy is that it isnt a light read. Yes, Im serious. The psychological aspect of this book is beautifully done, and really makes the reader think as they are reading. I devoured page after page as I hunted for clues and tried to tie things together. Browne crafts the plot carefully, allowing the reader to keep an eye on the big picture while still paying attention to little details. I never felt like I was drowning in too much information at one time, or being given a watered down version of Miltons epic. Quite the opposite actually. To me, it felt like a balanced read. Giving me just enough to keep me reading on, but not so much that I felt like I was being spoon fed the plot. Perfectly done Robert Browne, perfectly done. Its not often that a book has the ability to render me speechless. However as I turned the last page of The Paradise Prophecy thats exactly what occurred. I was utterly blow away by the complex plot that Browne had crafted. He weaves a tale that pulls you in deep, and doesnt let you go until the last moment. Pages just flew by. That doesnt generally happen in a 400 page book, but before I knew it I was finished and gasping for air. I read this entirely through in one sitting. If youre looking at the cover of Robert Brownes book and thinking of similar titles, let me set you straight right now. Despite his name being similar to another writer, and despite this being a book along the same vein, this is infinitely better! At least such is the opinion of this humble reader. The Paradise Prophecy is a gripping, thrilling, and gorgeously written novel! Its everything I love about the thriller genre. Highly recommended!
I have heard a lot about this series all over the Instagram world and the booktube world. I have been wanting to read it for some time now, but just never picked it up. A friend and I have been doing a buddyread type of deal where we pick a book and read it I usually read three books by time she finishesand then we talk about it. This is one of the series we chose because she loves fairy tales and so do I. I finished this book last night. I slowed down on reading it because I wanted it to last. Its a Cinderella retelling, but it doesnt feel like Cinderella. It felt like a totally different story. The characters were amazingly written, the story definitely intriguing, and the relationships were interesting and realistic. I seriously loved everything about this story from the dystopian feel to the cliffhanger ending. The imagery was great while the flow of the story as easy to follow. Just In Case Youre Curious: Similarities to Cinderella: Characters A handsome prince Prince Kai is kind and loves his people. A Servant girl Cinder is cyborg which means she belongs to her stepmother and looked at as less than human. Friendly Mice Iko is an android whom has a glitch in her personality chip. She sometimes forgets she isnt human. I compared her character to that of the mice in Cinderella. She is important and loved by Cinder and helps her get through her life.  Mean StepMother Adri is just wrong. She sees Cinder as a burden. She cant stand her. Nice Father The man who rescued her was kind to her and cared for her. He got the plague and died leaving Cinder to Adri, his wife StepSisters Cinder has two. Pearl is mean and uncaring when it comes to Cinder. She has the same view of Cinder as Adri does. Then there is Peony who looks at Cinder as just another human, soemone to be treated with respect.  Other The Ball The Prince is holding a ball for his coronation. Everyone is invited. Dresses Adri has her girls dresses made to impress the Prince. she does not make Cinder one.  The Shoe Spoilers here, so Ill just say she loses it, but not in the way youll expect. I definitely recommend this read. And though there are all these similarities to Cinderella, the book is different and feels like a completely different world. Do not let the similarities deter you.
Me Before You was the book club pick for the Sisterhood of the Traveling Book Club for February. I was having a bit of trouble deciding on what to read, and my dear friend Kathy suggested that we give this book a try. I immediately agreed, and did so just by going off the ratings that I had seen for the book at that point. I was definitely not disappointed. I knew this was going to be an emotional read even before I started it, and to be quite honest, the book broke me. I was able to keep my emotions in check for the most part, but in the last half of the book, I was an emotional mess. You will fall in love with the characters in this story, especially the two main characters, Louisa and Will. Lou was lots of fun and a bit snarky at times, which I love in a character. When we first meet her she has no idea what she wants from her life or her future. But she grows and matures so much throughout the novel, she really felt like a completely different person by the end of the book, in a good way! As for Will, you just couldnt help but sympathize with him for what he had been through, and for the decisions that he makes in the novel. But youll totally fall in love with him as well. Lou and Will have a wonderful chemistry together that makes this book so insanely special. But they arent the only characters that you will love in the novel. There is also Lous family; her parents, grandfather, sister and nephew. Her family is one that grew on me more and more throughout the novel, and by the end, I was pretty much in love with them as well, especially with her parents. Nathan, Wills health care worker was also a really great character. The storyline for this book is one that will really, really make you stop and think... Think about the choices you make in your life, and how those choices can be taken away from you in a heartbeat. Its about learning to love and to accept things that you cant change. As I mentioned above, this book was a really emotional read. Sometimes you just need to read something that will give you a really good cry, and this book will definitely do that. Overall; Im SO very glad to have read this book with my book club. We all agree that it was so good, and in our discussion we pretty much flailed over all the awesomeness that is this book. It really is a great read, so if you havent picked it up, please do so! Now that there the sequel has been announced, I am really looking forward to it as well. Happy Reading!
I really cant believe that its over. I dont quite know what to say. Its a little strange, but mostly heartbreaking. Because there are so many characters that I dont really want to let go of, but I think after all this, they deserve to rest a little. I dont want to go into too much detail, or spoil anything. But it was so very good. There were times I laughed, times I cried, times I was shellshocked, times I was confused, and times where I was just hanging on to every word. You know the descriptive cliche it was like a roller coaster?  well this was actually a roller coaster. Jammed with action, adventure, plot twists, breathtaking kisses, and just good characters, I was holding tight from start to finish. Cassandra Clare created this amazing world. And then she put amazing characters in it. She made them suffer, she made us suffer  and yet, she never lost humor, or stopped making sense. She never threw in a stupid twist because she didnt know what to do next. She wielded her words masterfully. She had everything planned out, and used language to create beautiful quotes and scenes. There was so much that happened, but never did anything turn awfully overwhelming. If anything, it was overwhelmingly good. In fact, it was so good, I was almost surprised. In the past, I wished she had just stopped at book three. I wished she hadnt thrown beloved characters back into another war. But somehow she did it without it seeming like a ploy for money. It seemed like she had a story tell and wasnt done telling it yet. If anyone is still hesitating about reading the final three, I suggest reading them. Its the way the story was meant to be told. Shadowhunters rarely rest after all. Another thing that had me nearly in tears was how she worked in the characters from The Infernal Devices. It was woven together perfectly, and gave me such a pang of nostalgia. I missed the characters and it was wonderful seeing them again. Also, the way Clare writes immortality is one of the most terrifying and beautiful things in these books. Its sad, shocking, and just so exquisitely painful. Immortality is really such a frightening prospect; the way things fade away except for what lasts forever. It makes my heart ache. Finally, while I lament the end of the Mortal Instruments, I am now very excited for The Dark Artifices. There are definitely some openings for her next series. I wonder how old characters will be brought in...but the introduction of the new characters was well done too. I really loved meeting new faces, and am ready to delve into their stories. New and old stories will mix together, but The Mortal Instruments series is now officially over. You are now free to both grieve and rejoice.
This is the thrilling sequel to Cinder, which doesnt simply continue the story of Cinder and her daring escape, but adds a new set of characters that are as equally engaging as those we are familiar with. This introduces us to Scarlet, and is, yes, the retelling of Little Red Riding Hood with a Big Bad Street Fighter in place of a wolf and a grandmother whos more missing than shes dinner. I like it. And I like Scarlet better than I liked Cinder to begin with, because Scarlet isnt tied down by a hidden legacy or false identities, which makes her feel more wholesome. There are secrets shell have to uncover, to be sure, but she can stand her own ground, and her loyalty to her family is admirable. The major plot of the book is with Scarlet, but Cinder is not simply rolling her thumbs in prison. Shes picked up a sidekick however reluctantly; the almostCaptain Thorne, whos fucking hilarious and an absolute joy, and theyre out and about, running from authorities and unlocking Cinders past. In the end the two stories intertwine and suddenly two stories become one and its as well done as you could hope. It does suffer a little from being a middle book, and thus the plot is a little slow in places, leaving room for background info and a slow buildup to the real showdown in Winter. What it lacks in storytelling it makes up for with awesome characters. I was more immediately fond of Scarlet, than I was of Cinder, so this was easier to get into, but watching Cinder grow and come to terms with herself is really wonderful to see as well. More importantly, this series hasnt lost sight of the fact that the real heroes of this story are the heroines. No one not even the guys are there simply to be someones romantic interest, and love is not the ultimate goal, however when it occurs it is portrayed as a strength, not a weakness and god bless Marissa Meyer for that. I have no doubt these girls could overthrow countries, and that is so fucking fantastic. Slipping onto her hip, Cinder glanced back to see Scarlet marching down the ramp, carrying a shotgun. That is perhaps my favorite moment from the book. I can get down with girls saving other girls with shotguns. Next up is Cress, and I am excited!
This is not an average book, and I know that many people will read it, and have different feelings about it, but this book is one of a kind. The kind of book that breaks the mold of your thoughts on several different topics; what teenagers should act like, the things cancer patients should joke about, if you had one wish how would you spend it? What happens when your hero turns out to be a disappointment, and the real hero was always around. This is not a book about cancer, or about death. This is a book about love and life. It is about two people who fall into love in the most organic of ways under the most inorganic of circumstances. This is a story that is so great, that I want it to remain just mine forever, I wish I was the only one who ever read it, because Hazel and Augustus deserve to be so much more than just characters in a book. They are timeless, theyre story one that bears the marks that none before can ever bear, and none after will ever bear. In these pages is a love that is so simple, and easy and at the same time so complex and difficult, it is a love that cant be categorized, but one that can only be experienced. I loved every character in this book, because they were all so real. So real that I wanted to go friend them on facebook ASAP. But they were also all very far from perfect yes even Augustus Waters had faults he played that Prince of Dawn game way too much. And thats what I loved. This story was far from perfect. But in all its imperfections was several instances of perfect love, perfect friendship, perfect parenting, perfect grief. I want to ramble on about every single sentence of this book, but I cant because it would be doing it an injustice. I have to say that I came to understand and appreciate so much about the life that I have, and I have come to see the metaphors out there thanks to Augustus. I was trying to find my favorite quotes but there were so many. So I chose these three because I think they sum up the essence of this book. Its a metaphor, he said. You choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances . . . I said. Oh, yes. He smiled. The big, goofy, real smile. Im a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. My thoughts are stars I cant fathom into constellations. If youre looking for typical, dont bother picking up this one. But if you want a chance at being a spectator to one of the greatest love stories I have ever read, pick up this book. Thanks Angie for pressuring me into reading this one
The third instalment of the Lewis trilogy preceeded by The Blackhouse and The Lewis Man and to my mind, the most enjoyable of the series. Ex Edinburgh DI Fin MacLeod has severed ties from the mainland and his former life, and taken up permanent residence on the Isle of Lewis, working as head of security for a private estate. After the discovery of a plane and body in a drained loch, and an illegal spate of poaching, Fin is thrust into an uneasy relationship with his friend Whistler Macaskill as the secrets of their shared past resonates into the present, culminating in suspicion and murder. Although essentially a murder mystery I think this actually plays second fiddle to Mays adroit mapping of human relationships and the study of old friendships and enmities that colour the central investigation. The book moves effortlessly between past and present, charting Fins experiences as a younger man employed as a roadie for a local band, finding himself enmeshed in the central creative and personal tensions of his friends and bandmates. With the disappearance of one of them in a suspected plane crash, we discover that all is not as it seems and these relationships all have a part to play in the central mystery and impact strongly on the present set aspect of the novel. The most important friendship is that of Fin and Whistler and in the depiction of their relationship May introduces moments of extreme poignancy, particularly as Fins aunt, who raises Fin after his parents death, takes Whistler and his alcoholic bully of a father to task over Whistlers upbringing thus sealing the strength of Fin and Whistlers friendship for years to come. The mercurial Whistler is revealed throughout the book as a volatile character who causes no end of grief to Fin, and plays an integral part to the central plot that at times pulls on the heartstrings, particularly in Whistlers relationship with his feisty estranged teenage daughter. As a number of Fins professional and personal relationships are woven into the plot with the dark secrets of the past coming to light, this adds layers of interest to the story and makes us wonder exactly who Fin can trust and where his future lies. As in the other two books, the natural and, at times, harsh beauty of the Outer Hebrides is perfectly captured throughout, drawing on the history of the island and the way of life of its inhabitants, coloured by its staunchly religious traditions. The portrayal of landscape takes on the mantle of another character in the book and the textures and hues of this largely unspoilt wilderness is beautifully portrayed. Having previously enjoyed Mays China based thrillers featuring detective Li Yan, Im also a firm fan of this trilogy and would certainly encourage other readers to seek them out, as May is a phenomenally good thriller writer with an innate skill in plotting, characterisation and sense of place. A great read.
I dont know what I expected when I started this, but it wasnt the book I got and if I could give this more than five stars, I would. In so many ways, it shouldnt work  there are so many threads within the pages, so many different themes of love, friendship, scifi, growing up, family, history, finding your place, alternate universes and traditions that it would have been so easy for the storyline to get muddled and bogged down, but when I read it, every page held my attention and every time I had to put it down, it filled me with this antsy regret that I couldnt keep reading. The central character is Natalie and she has always been different. Shes the adopted daughter of two wonderful parents, the elder sister to twins and she has never felt as though she belongs. Since she was a child she had dreams of an older woman, Grandmother, who would tell her various parables from the First Nations and the book starts with Grandmother telling Natalie that she has 3 months left to save someone. What follows on from there is a time travel scifi lovestory very much grounded in a very realistic world. It sounds odd, but whilst reading it, I never felt this is ridiculous  its not even possible it felt like something that of course could happen. Natalie is a wonderful narrator  she felt real. Confident in herself or at least good at faking it, complex and layered  she never felt caricaturish, and reading on, even when you dont agree with her, you understand her. When her resolve wavers, you understand because it feels like a genuine reaction. I felt invested in her very quickly, which isnt always the case. Beau is just the most wonderful character  he had a Tim Riggins feel, although perhaps even more likeable and when the twist came, I got why Grandmother had put the events into motion, as messed up as it was in some ways, because how could you not? The First Nation stories used to tie the story together was such a wonderful decision  I found myself reading them and trying to work out how they tied it together. It was clever without feeling too clever and it ended perfectly...which you dont get to say that often with YA books. I just cant really say enough about it...I would have read 300 more pages and been happy to do so. I get that for some people it may be a completely different experience, but for whatever reason, this story, and how it was told, really grabbed me and Im so happy that it did.
Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for both her kindness, and her stunning yet imperfect beauty which is said to be more breathtaking than that of her stepmothers, Queen Levana. Levana fears her stepdaughter will take control of her throne, her people, and her power and she is willing to do whatever it takes to preserve her reign over the hearts and minds of her people. Winter despises her stepmother and has been attempting to undermine her in her own way, and now she has some new allies  Cinder, Scarlet, and Cress. Together, perhaps they will be able to end Levanas despotic rule once and for all. Winter is a fantastic conclusion to the brilliant Lunar Chronicles. I have loved following this series every step of the way. I was worried about the finale, but I shouldnt have been because this is a good solid ending to one of my favorite series. I read the novel over the course of just over three weeks  not just because of the sheer size of the novel, but because I wanted to savor every last moment I could with these characters. In regards to the characters, Winter is a compelling addition to the main cast. Shes very sweet with a hearty dose of crazy, and thankfully she is able to hold her own alongside our already established core. Without giving too much away overall, Cinder and Kai steal the ending, Scarlet and Wolf endure the most, Cress and Thorne are still my favorites everything that comes out of his mouth is golden, and Iko is still awesome. The characters all have a long road ahead of them at the beginning of this novel, and the character development is above average. Everyone has their own time to shine. As usual, Marissa Meyer incorporates the fairy tale elements to Winters story. Obviously, we have Levana as the evil stepmother evil queen, Jacin as the huntsman, the apple, the glass coffin, and the seven dwarfs All of the key elements that you would expect to be associated with a Snow White retelling have been given a unique scifi makeover. We also get a better look at Luna itself and Levanas court, which reminded me of the Capitol from The Hunger Games. In the end, my only real issue is the length of the novel. Although, I loved every second of it, it could have been trimmed back a bit in places without hurting the main storylines. Overall, Winter is everything that I could have asked for to wrap up one of my favorite series and there is so much to love about it. I still need to get my hands on Stars Above and the upcoming graphic novels, but I will truly miss these characters when its all said and done. Im beyond excited for Marissa Meyers take on Wonderland in Heartless and also superheroes and supervillains in an as yet unnamed new series.
This is not an average book, and I know that many people will read it, and have different feelings about it, but this book is one of a kind. The kind of book that breaks the mold of your thoughts on several different topics; what teenagers should act like, the things cancer patients should joke about, if you had one wish how would you spend it? What happens when your hero turns out to be a disappointment, and the real hero was always around. This is not a book about cancer, or about death. This is a book about love and life. It is about two people who fall into love in the most organic of ways under the most inorganic of circumstances. This is a story that is so great, that I want it to remain just mine forever, I wish I was the only one who ever read it, because Hazel and Augustus deserve to be so much more than just characters in a book. They are timeless, theyre story one that bears the marks that none before can ever bear, and none after will ever bear. In these pages is a love that is so simple, and easy and at the same time so complex and difficult, it is a love that cant be categorized, but one that can only be experienced. I loved every character in this book, because they were all so real. So real that I wanted to go friend them on facebook ASAP. But they were also all very far from perfect yes even Augustus Waters had faults he played that Prince of Dawn game way too much. And thats what I loved. This story was far from perfect. But in all its imperfections was several instances of perfect love, perfect friendship, perfect parenting, perfect grief. I want to ramble on about every single sentence of this book, but I cant because it would be doing it an injustice. I have to say that I came to understand and appreciate so much about the life that I have, and I have come to see the metaphors out there thanks to Augustus. I was trying to find my favorite quotes but there were so many. So I chose these three because I think they sum up the essence of this book. Its a metaphor, he said. You choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances . . . I said. Oh, yes. He smiled. The big, goofy, real smile. Im a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. My thoughts are stars I cant fathom into constellations. If youre looking for typical, dont bother picking up this one. But if you want a chance at being a spectator to one of the greatest love stories I have ever read, pick up this book. Thanks Angie for pressuring me into reading this one
As I turned the final pages of this rare and magical read, I was filled with melancholy and longing. Ordinary life seems so, well, ordinary. I ached to remain a reveur  a devotee of Le Cirque des Reves  lost in the black and white gloaming of this circus of illusion and wonder. This is a story for romantics. It is about the power of magic over fate, of love over destiny, of community over individual will. It is told in a dreamlike narrative that unfolds within the vault of your imagination as it intersects with Morgensterns vivid descriptions. The third person omniscient voice and the presenttense setting work in deliberate contretemps, as you move both with the action and yet above it all. Morgenstern also shifts the setting between chapters the story takes place in lush, late Victorian Gothic between 1873 and 1903, with presentday making a cameo appearance, allowing sleightofhand foreshadowing and memories to tilt her parallel worlds even more offcenter. The book jacket description is deceptive and is perhaps partly to blame for the perceived weakness of the story: that this is a book of settings, not plot. The action is muted, the competition between the two skilled illusionists slow to unfold and rarely heated. Do not embark upon this journey thinking you will see sparks fly between dueling wizards, or swoop into a tundra with angels and polar bears chasing mad scientists, or follow the quest of elves and hobbits seeking a cursed ring. You will, however, be mesmerized by a world that seems sinister and pure at the same time. Morgensterns allegories do not have the weight of Lewis, Pullman, or Tolkien nor does her story have the addictive immediacy of J.K. Rowlings creations. At times she lets slip a modern colloquialism that rings trite, but on the whole her writing is enchanting. She pays homage to the greatest literary fairy tales and fantasies in her own fashion, creating heroes out of ordinary folk, making burdens out of gifts, and allowing her characters just enough free will to undo what nature has set in motion. It was a joy to lose myself in her beautiful writing, in her unique and colorful world, and in the souls of her tender characters. This was a reminder of why I love to read: for pleasure, to be delighted, to wander away from reality. Too bad I have to be jolted awake. There are some dreams you wish would never end.
First off: the cover, OMG Then there was the writing, The romance, The world, : And pretty much everything else, But to summarize, its this, Meets this, Needless to say, I really enjoyed myself. The first fifty pages were really hard for me to get into. I felt like I was dropped into the story without a lot of purchase or back story. I think it would have worked much better to have an intro chapter for both Tarver and Lilac  the former exploring his war hero status, and the latter going into more detail about Lilacs relationships both the false and the real with the people in her life. I think it would have eased me into the story a bit more. The rest of the novel was wonderful. I loved quick witted, poet soldier Tarver and stubborn, somewhat spoiled Lilac. I think with Tarver we see a more deeper character in the military, which Im not used to seeing, and with Lilac we get a lot of inner strength and stubborn resolve. In some ways I felt like the romance at the beginning and the end was a bit contrived, but I couldnt help but be swept up in this story. After a Titanicesque spaceship named Icarus is pulled out of hyperspace the passengers scramble. Its really only a atreange twist of fate that puts Lilac and Tarver into the same escape pod, allowing them to break away from the doomed spacecraft and getasin toward the nearest desolate planet for safety. I was really intrigued by the planet they landed on, everything from its mirror moon, weird primal cat, and the strange energy entities that seem to follow and haunt our two main characters. Although the story is told in alternating POVs between Tarver and Lilac, I quickly found myself in love with both of them, normally thats difficult for me, but here it worked really well. I was both surprised and elated by the plot twists and the ending, and even though it appears on the surface that Lilac and Tarver will be allowed to be together, I doubt they will be alloiqed thgeoir freedom so easily. I worry for what implications the plkanets destruction will have on Lilac, and Im interested in uncovering more of this worlds secrets. I need the sequel. And I need it NOW! Reread March 2015, almost a year to the day since the original read, LOL I knew I wanted to explore this again after reading This Shattered World  not to say that I didnt enjoy that book, but this one still has my heart. A few new thoughtsobservations: Loved the fact that Tarver is a poet. I dont want to say that I missed that the first time around, but I think I was in love with everything else that I overlooked how much I enjoyed that. Still though, my only major complaint is that the book is too short, especially in light of the fact that the series expands with other characters, rather than Lilac and Tarver. I wanted more time on the Icarus, more time on the planted, booth before and after the final explosive moments. I wanted Tarver to build her a house, damn it! I seem to gravitate to this story in March, so maybe Ill do an annual yearly read every year.
Ever look back on your school life and think Glad I dont have to do that again! Imagine dealing with the typical school issues opposite sex, hierarchy of groups, invites to parties ... this is before we even get into grades when you also have a disability? Then imagine the disability is a physical one. That is the challenge that meets August. August was born with a facial deformity. He is approaching grade 5 and after dealing with surgeries and hospital visits most of his life, his parents feel he is ready to bridge from home schooling to main stream school. August lives with his very loving parents, older sister Via who is normal and his dog Daisy. This very powerful and moving book by first time author R. J. Palacio is a touching story of August, his family and the friends he made in his first year at mainstream school. From the incredible first paragraph with the sentences: I know Im not an ordinary tenyear old kid. ... But I know ordinary kids dont make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids dont get stared at wherever the go. You are hooked into Augusts life and boy what a life he leads. Its an emotional roller coaster as you find yourself wanting to protect this fictional character. The author captures the awkward feelings everyone has felt in middle school from the sitting alone at the lunch table to the cliques that every school seems to have. August has to deal with these plus know that everyone is avoiding him. Well, not everyone. Augusts new head teacher, Mr Tushman, has arranged for students Jack, Julian and Charlotte to come to the school over the summer to show August around. While on the tour, we can start to sense some of August anxiety but also the willingness of some kids wanting to get past the looks. The book is one that you continue to think about days after reading it. I was told it was geared to kids but really dont think that this is a book that can be pigeon holed into one genre. The writing is beautifully crafted to embrace the many complex emotions most of us has ensured at one time or another. It also covers many difficulties that people of all ages continue to battle in adulthood. Id be very surprised if this doesnt win awards.
YOU GUYS, HI. THIS BOOK WAS SO THIS BOOK. WHAT WORDS TO USE I DO NOT KNOW. MUCH FLOUNDERING. BOOK HAS CREATED NOOK FOR ITSELF IN BRAIN AND IMPRINTED DEMON SHADOW IN NEURAL CELLS FOREVER. CAUSES TO TYPE ALL CAPS OH NO. Okay, Ill stop now. But seriously. THIS BOOK, THIS  BOOK. I have been meaning to read The Stand for yearrrrs now, but I kept putting it off. Ever since I discovered about four to five years ago that Stephen Kings storytelling was my jam after years of being convinced I would hate it, because scary, its been sitting there like a tricksy little book demon on my shelf, all small and fat. I kept putting it off and putting it off, though, because I knew once I started it Id be sucked in, and I also knew it would scare me, and also that it would be a huge time investment. I mean, I read pretty fast, but still. I generally like to finish a book in 23 days at most. This one is a sevendayer, minimum. And so of course I followed it up by reading two other chunkers like a dummy, one of many reasons I only read seven books in June. It was worth it. I havent read many books that truly deserve to be described as Epic with a capital E, but this is definitely one of them. From the opening salvos of the plague, we watch from the inside as civilization dies, and the survivors start a journey none of them really understand, all of which culminates in a fight between good and evil that somehow manages to avoid feeling predictable or trite. In fact, quite the opposite. The Stand is a book that effortlessly straddles the line between inevitability and predictability, and intimate character work with an epic scope. And Randall Flagg as villain struck exactly the right balance for me, because King got to have his cake and eat it, too. He got the larger than life baddie, and yet he also got to have villains with real human motivations, because in the end its not really about Mother Abagail vs. Randall Flagg, its about what they represent in humanity. Each character chooses for themselves. Of course, its not a perfect book. I dont understand the function of Nadine as a character at all, and she was a significant part of the narrative. The whole time I was reading, she made me want to pull my hair out because I didnt understand her motivations at all. As opposed to Harold, who even at his most despicable, was always understandable. Its also very much a product of its time, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, as long as you judge it in context and not by todays standards. No doubt King would have written it differently had it been published in 2016 instead of 1978 though I read the uncut 1990 version, updated with creepy pop culture references that make it seem as if King is some sort of unholy timetraveler or cassandra, able to predict the future, and wasting it on predicting Freddy Krueger. So one down of The Big Three, two to go. It will probably be at least a couple of years before Im brave enough to tackle It or The Shining. But Im definitely starting The Dark Tower soon now that Ive read this, Salems Lot and The Eyes of the Dragon. I AM READY. Im not ready.
Elle looked back to the door of the sanctuary, and saw the new priest. The dream ended. The spell was broken. Elle woke up. I am trying my hardest to finish The Original Sinners series before its final installment, The Queen, is released at the end of October. With a TBR list a mile long and a few GR Challenges in my way, that task has been difficult. When I began reading The Saint, I was immediately reminded of why I love Tiffany Reisz and her characters so much. Her books are like crack, and Im an addict! Im completely obsessed with Nora and Kingsley and Soren and the whole wicked crew. In The Saint, Nora has found Kingsleys son Nico and is recounting how she met Kingsley, which also involved how she met and fell in love with her beloved Soren. First of all, teenage Eleanor Schreiber, or Elle, is as feisty as her older counterpart Nora Sutherlin. Even then she was quickwitted and devious. Her view of St. Theresas encounter with an angel as orgasmic, her writing a raunchy Esther story, her masturbating on Sorens desk in his church office  teenage Nora was naughty, and I love her! And that moment when Eleanor first sees her Ducatidriving, sadist of a Catholic priest for the first time. Striding down the aisle behind the crucifer and the deacon was a mana man with blond hair and a gods face. He looked forward with eyes so serious and solemn she followed his gaze to the altar to see if Jesus waited for him there. And God saw that it was good. The Saint is filled to the brim with stories of a teenage Nora and her churchs new priest, Father Marcus Stearns. We discover how she found her pen name Sutherlin, her first reaction to seeing Soren, her first exposure to the BDSM lifestyle, her initial encounter with Kingsley, the story behind Nora watering the tree branch, her relationship with her mother and father  there are so many truths revealed in this book! You can say it now, she said, her voice low and reverent. I love you, Little One. She relaxed into his arms and closed her eyes. He held her close, held her tight. She could have died in that moment and regretted nothing. Its crazy how a piece of literature can justify a 29yearold priest falling in love with a 15yearold girl in his congregation, but by the end of the book you are begging for something to happen between them. Eleanor and Sorens first sexual encounter was absolutely breathtaking. Rough, painful, dirty, but quintessentially Soren. It was everything I thought it would be and more. AMAZING! He thrust so hard into her she stopped breathing. He thrust again just as hard and she exhaled once more. It had to be like this, it had to be brutal. It wasnt enough to take her virginityhe had to obliterate it. If you have not yet begun reading The Original Sinners series, read it now! Start with The Siren and go from there. Tiffany Reisz is the Mistress of intelligent erotic fiction. Five holy hot sadist of a priest stars!
This deleted scene was a portion of Clockwork Prince. The only exception is that instead of Will in the released scene this one features Jem. If I had read this when it was originally offered it may have had a stronger impact. Since Ive read Clockwork Prince this short snippet had nothing to offer me. Looking for more Wicked Reads review: vkwickedreads.wordpress.com Merged review: A deleted scene between Will and Jem during Clockwork Prince. I enjoyed this look from Wills point of view. I enjoy being inside his mind. This scene shows the strong bond between Will and Jem. It showcases how each would do anything for the other to find true happiness. It is a gift to have a companion for life, as the two have each other. More Wicked Reads reviews posted on: vkwickedreads.wordpress.com Merged review: Alright, I am going to act like a total fangirl, which I never do... This book was awesome, splendid, amazing, engrossing, enthralling, wicked. Okay, enough fangirl action... I have read so many books lately in the YA genre that are total garbage that ppl rave about. This book however doesnt fall into any of those traps. The characters are genuine and maintain their personality traits throughout the book. They do not act like a 50 yr old one moment and a 2 yr old the next thank goodness I think I like the storyline of the infernal devices better then the mortal instruments series. I do love the other, but the story seems to be loosing its focus. I enjoys these characters more, as well. I do know how the story unfolds. I have two theories, which I will not say as to be spoiler free. Mild Spoiler I do think it is possible to love two ppl at a time, just not in the same manner, but with equal intensity. This is not the usual triangle that YA genre employs. Usually they throw instalove at us. Here, it is based on friendship with one and chemistry with the other. I enjoyed the hell outta this part of the story! I wanna know what the hell Tessa is.... I have theories on that as well... I wanna know if I am right! I love the new additions to the institute and I cant wait to see how they reek havoc on everyone. One I believe will be a calming influence and the person who showed up on the last page will cause issues with TessJem. I cant wait for it! :  its going to be a very long wait..... :
There were times I absolutely loved the book, but there were other times when I felt the characters were forced to make things more complicated by Cassandra Clare. Ive said it time and again, I hate love triangles and this one is particularly excruciating. Clare stays true to the characters while still making them develop, which was really great. Im not angry at Tessa because she really does try to stay away from Will after what he did to her in the last book. Usually I get annoyed at the girl in the middle of it all but not this time. No, Im angry at Cassandra Clare. She couldnt have made it worse for the trio. She made the situations collide at just the right moment to make for optimum awfulness. This is not fair to Tessa, Will, Jem, and worse of all me.Oh, I have a horrible feeling about the next book. I know people love the romance, and I am truly a romantic at heart but what is it with Jem and Will acting like they cant live without Tessa? I understand that people dont want to live without the person they love but whatever happened to being strong on your own? The best couples are the people who are also the best individuals. Arent they? Its what I always believed. Really the only problem I had with the book was the love triangle which was actually a big part of this installment but there were times when I liked their interactions. So now for the parts that didnt make me want to glare at Clare from hundreds of miles away. The characters development played a big part but not in the way that it doesnt seem plausible. Will is given a great deal of spot light which I knew would happen. You cant have a jerk especially a love interest in a story without a back story. Jem on the other hand is also given a lot of time...a lot of time with Tessa that is. I like it that we saw a little of the other characters as well. Charlotte and her husband add a bit of odd sweetness to the story, and I like the new maid. I hope she plays a bigger role in the third book. Tessa is a good heroine, she is not an idiot who puts herself into situations for feeble or senseless reasons. And lastly I like the setting. At times I felt it was a little too informal but I think the time period gave it a good atmosphere, especially with the Institution. The ending is done in a oh no she didnt cliffhanger kind of way that just makes me want to read the next installment so bad. It set up the third book perfectly for some high emotions, hold your breath suspense, and rip roaring action. My expectations are high.
This book actually this was two books, but they went together pretty well, so I see why they are bound together was totally awesome. It had just the right amount of nerve affecting plot to keep me turning pages and lighthearted humor to make me happy to o so. I loved the strong, interesting characters, and the humorous banter. This book actually mildly reminds me of early David Eddings books, but more a more grown up version. I just love books that have funny lines, especially when it doesnt seem forced. Anytime something seemed like it might be to grim there was humor or lightheartedness, and I actually really like that. Dont get me wrong; that doesnt mean this isnt a serious book. I love the plot and how all these elements are just woven together. Some characters get good character development and there are strong female characters and sticky situations. At one point I realized a thief, a warrior, a scholar and a king were on a quest and they meet up with a wizard and there is a search for a long lost heir going on and I was like What?! Because this is totally a typical fantasy trope but it doesnt feel tired or overused at all. I love books that use tropes in someway unexpected. But seriously I really enjoy where this series is going. A note about the reading order: This book was written first, but there is a prequel series out now. I read that prequel book first and I wished Id read this book first. However, reading this book, Im glad I had read that other book. I knew little insights and things. However, overall, I think this is probably the series to start with, because I want to go back and reread the prequel so I can appreciate it fully. I think they are tied together amazingly well. I never would have known this book was written first because it mentions so many things from the prequel. The main reason I liked that I had read the prequel first is that this book feels like you are starting in the middle of things. Like you dont know the land or the characters and you are so very slowly introduced to both. However I like that. there arent any infodumps about the land or the characters. You just slowly get to know them. Its fun. Anyway, I really highly recommend these books for people who enjoy epic fantasy but dont like being bogged down with heavy dreary things and enjoy shenanigans.
This and other reviews can be found on The Psychotic Nerd THE RUNDOWN For the past two years, Emily and Sloane are best friends. That is, until Sloane disappears without any warning. Emily is lost without Sloane. Sloanes the social one, Emilys the shy girl. And now that Sloane is gone, Emily doesnt know what to do. But then, the list appears. A list of 13 crazy, risky things that Emily would never dare to do. But what will happen if she follows the list? MY THOUGHTS It is official! Morgan Matson is now one of my alltime favorite authors! I have read, and adored, both Second Chance Summer and Amy  Rogers Epic Detour! Now I can add Since Youve Been Gone onto the list! To be perfectly honest, I wasnt that excited about this book when I first saw it. Just based on the synopsis it just didnt seem like my kind of book. But I picked it up anyway, since I loved Morgans other books. And boy was I wrong about this not being my kind of book! I adored this book! One of the amazing things of this book was how Emily changed throughout the book. At the beginning, Emily is the shy girl. There are scenes where she wants to ask something, but to scared to start a conversation with a stranger. There are also scenes where she stands around awkwardly because being social is not her thing. I an relate to both of these things by the way. I am a shy girl as well But when Emily goes outside of her comfort zone by crossing off things on the list, she becomes less shy and earns some friends along the way. And its really amazing seeing how this happens. Thus bringing me to another thing that I liked about this book: How the list played out. I really liked the list and thought it was a really cute idea, but what I liked even more was how the list was not just go do this. Sure, thats basically what the list said, but the way that Emily tried to do the things on the list played out in completely different ways than expected. That is what I loved! I also want to touch up on the friendship between Emily and Sloane. At first, I did not believe that Emily and Sloane were truly best friends. What kind of best friend would leave without any warning? But as the book went on, I realized that they were absolute best friends and that Sloane, while I do think that her reasoning was stupid, she did have her reasons. All in all, they do have a beautiful friendship. IN CONCLUSION This was such a great read! Full with a fun, entertaining story along with an amazing character transformation and a beautiful friendship! I highly recommend this book and any book by Morgan Matson!
She wanted again to hold on to him, and have him hold on to her, so they could whirl together through the cosmos like galaxies that could notand would notbe confined. Stars Out of 10: 9.510 Overall Thoughts: I always love books with games, competitions, or riddles, and this one was no exception! Its definitely different in how it was done, and wasnt like most game related books Ive read, but I loved it for its uniqueness! The characters were amazing to read, and I loved both the POVs that I was given! Overall, a great book, and Im curious what the author will do with the rest! SPOILERS BEGIN HERE The Good: The plot and competition was really well fleshed out! I also loved the main characters a lot, and reading from them was very enjoyable. There also wasnt necessarily one bad and one good enchanter, and in my opinion, I wasnt rooting for Vika or Nikolai to win, as I liked them both so much! I also loved how well the book meshed with the historical aspect of Russia, and it was really interesting to read from that time and region! The Bad: it wasnt what I expected from a competition based book, and while thats not bad in itself, I was slightly disappointed because of this. However, thats more on me than the author and book! I also didnt really care for any of the side characters, or at least did not like them as much as the main characters. The Characters: I loved Vika, Nikolai, and Sergei, and while none of the other side characters really meshed with me, I still liked their contributions to the story. I only disliked Pasha near the end, and was surprised by his sudden transformation, even with the aiding of Yuliana. The Plot: I really enjoyed the plot. The twists of heritage always shocked me, and so did the death of Nikolai and use of Galinas knife at the end! It truly captured my attention, and managed to just grab tighter on to it as the book continued on! The World Building: I loved the blending of Russian culture and magic. We not only saw the culture of magic and its role, but also a political side of the empires present at that time, as well as social hierarchy and the languages spoken! The Stereotypical Tropes: Love Triangle The Favorite Character: Vika or Nikolai! Buy it, Borrow it, or Bin it: Buy it!
I recently met V.E. Schwab and found her entertaining and charming. So I acquired one of her books! I dont think my review of this work is affected by knowing the author, but I like to be transparent. I always like to avoid spoilers, but in this case, I think the book jacket gives away a bit of the setting, so Ill share it here as well. Imagine four Londons, existing simultaneously but separately. Each has a differing amount of magic, with black London a loss, and Red London a place where magic is like an extra sensory level. Kell is our protagonist, a young man with the very rare ability to travel among the Londons. Indeed, that is one of his duties, for the royalty of each London are aware of one another and wish to stay in touch. Kell is a de facto member of the royal family of Red London, treated as a son and brother, but also as a value possession.The one thing that is forbidden to Kell is to bring artifacts or souvenirs from one London to another. And of course, that is the pivot point of the story. And it should be enough to intrigue you into sampling it. The tale is told from multiple points of view. I liked how the characters were introduced as well as how the Londons were shown. No time is wasted in pulling the reader into the story, and once the action begins, it is relentless. I was pleased to see how advanced magic mimics technology in Red London, for I feel that this is an aspect that is often neglected in stories of worlds where magic exists and is exploited as commonplace. I also felt that the way Kell is exploited by his adoptive and loving family has deep roots in human nature. Given the ruthless nature of Kells antagonists, the story does not flinch from some very dark violence. All good points in my estimation. Quibbles: This book is part of a longer series. As I drew toward the close and realized that not all the conflicts could be resolved in the remaining number of pages, I wished that I had known that from the start. At one point in the story, the characters have a sanctuary and an ally that I wished had been introduced sooner. But both of these quibbles are based on my personal preference and may not impact your reading enjoyment at all! And given the teaser chapter in the back of this book, it looks as if A Gathering of Shadows may focus more on one of the characters I especially enjoyed. All in all, a solidly constructed fantasy with fully realized characters and a unique setting!
 spoiler alert  Oh. My. Fing. God........ When I finally got my hands on this book, I had to wait before reading it because I kind of felt that I was pretty much riding into a shit storm. I pretty much stared at it for days. Almost preparing for battle. I had heard EVERYONE and their cats talk about this book. Good and bad reviews. I had adored the first one so I already knew I would feel very much the same with its sequel. Not only because I felt a strong connection to Feyre but because I loved the way Maas wrote such rich backs stories to supporting characters. You end up rallying for them just as much as the main characters to fall in love and to not die. This world Maas created is so engrossing. But....Im going to be really honest here...this book totally and completely wrecked me. Ive read a bunch of different reviews on ACOMAF. I lot of them talk about how whiny Freyre is or how Rhysand is such a wounded hero with another boring sob story. Now I get to have my say since Ive read it. I can tell you why I feel very, very different about this particular view on Feyre. I feel very strong bond with Feyre because even though she is just a fictional character she is going through things similar to our reality. She dealt with a love that was beautiful, mighty, and powerful in Thorns and Roses. In Mist and Fury that very love shed given up everything for has become ugly, abusive, twisted, and perverted. This one quote that really struck a cord with me: Im thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me any hint of kindness and safety. And Im thinking maybe he knew that  maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesnt work for whowhat I am now. I have felt that exact same feeling. I fell in love with the wrong person and it left scars. The kind of scars one gets from someone who says they love you and then hurts you and then says they will never do it again. To say this was emotional read for me is an understatement, reading that quote made me put down the book for a bit. It felt so real and painful. So no Feyre is not whiny nor is she stupid to feel those emotions or act the way she did. The rest of the book was of course filled with lots of humour, new curious friends and plenty of banter with sexy Rhysand. You get to see a lot more Rhysand in this one. I really enjoyed learning more about him and who he really is. Their romance kind of made me think of Hades and Persephone. The guy whos supposed to be a villain but turns out to be the hero. Spring court and Night court, I think that fits. I cannot wait for the next one.. and I see its not out until May 4, 2017. What the hell do I do until then? Well better mark my calendar now.
Originally finished 5th Feb 2012, currently rereading. Review from my blog,  The Clockwork Angel is a Steampunk prequel to Cassandra Clares Mortal Instruments series. While I did really enjoy the original series or at least the three of them I read, apparently there is a fourth now I feel that this book is far superior to the initial series. First of all, I enjoy the use of sarcastic humour on the parts of characters Jem and Will. Their wry comments made me laugh many times and Im not someone who is really into humour. This made them both likeable, despite their secrets and hidden darkness. Although I loved that too. I enjoyed the setting. I love things set in Victorian England, but I enjoy the Steampunk element because it allows for strong, emancipated female characters, and anachronistic technology and social mores. Clare seemed to have a good handle on both creating the characters and understanding where their behaviour differed from social behaviour of the time and making the reasons for it clear. For instance, the main character, Tessa was surprised at the familiar way that Shadowhunter adults addressed each other by their first names. I also liked the references to Boadicea, the warrior queen. Tessa is a likeable character because she is strong and determined. She does what she has to to survive, acting with great bravery and initiative. I also liked the characters of Will and Jem, the possible love interests. Although I feel that one is really put forward more strongly as a love interest than the other. Unlike with Simon in the original series, I liked both the main characters in this. Both had a great sarcastic sense of humour, and they both had darkness and tortured pasts, which always makes characters fascinating. Its that sense of wanting to know their secrets and save them from their darkness that draws you to them. I cant wait to learn more about the past of one of them that has not yet been revealed. I also liked Charlotte, head of the institute and Sophie, and would like to hear more of their stories, and perhaps the back story of Charlotte and Henry. There is some good steamy romance also, although never getting past the PG level, although there are references to sex assignations. There hasnt been all that much Steampunk technology yet, nothing out of the ordinary, and the supernatural elements from the earlier books are still at the forefront of the novel, but I think all the elements in the plotline have been well woven together. As usual with Clares books, I am much more interested in the interplay between the various characters than the particular plots and machinations of the seedy underworld. I am currently on the library waiting list for the next novel, and very much looking forward to it.
Louise Erdrichs Haunting New Novel About a Brutal Crime on the Reservation At its best, fiction transports us to places weve never been, immersing us in the lives of people we would never meet. The most powerful fiction leaves behind indelible memories, endowing its characters with meaning more vivid than life. Louise Erdrich received the National Book Award for The Round House, which is powerful beyond measure and achieved all this and more. Erdrich centers her tale on a bright 13yearold boy named Joe Coutts. When we first encounter Joe, we think we may have met him before. Hes the nice kid who lives down the block or around the corner, riding his bike, usually with his friends, through a middleclass suburb, getting into mischief. His fathers a judge, his mother a civil servant. How could his life be all that interesting? But Joes parents arent really like our neighbors, and they dont live in a middleclass suburb or a prosperous urban neighborhood. Though welleducated and welloff by local standards, they are members of the tightly interwoven Chippewa community confined to a reservation in a barren stretch of North Dakota or Minnesota. And The Round House is a tale of a brutal crime that afflicts the Coutts family and lays bare the deep fault lines in their community. As we get to know the Couttses and the many members of their extended family, we gradually become acquainted with the cruel legacy of racism that constrains their lives to this day. Sometimes we laugh along with them at the humor, marvel at the beauty of their storytelling, sigh with despair at the loss of the old ways. But we are never unaware of the uniquely disadvantaged circumstances they and their neighbors find themselves in. The Round House is Louise Erdrichs 14th novel. She is an enrolled i.e., official member of the Turtle Mountain Band of the Chippewa Nation whose grandfather was tribal chairman around the time of her birth in the 1950s. For three decades, she has been writing highly acclaimed works about her Native American heritage and the interaction of Native and majority communities. Her father was GermanAmerican. An extended account of Erdrichs life and career appears on Wikipedia, with numerous details about her long, tragic marriage to anthropologist Michael Dorris, whom she met as a student at Dartmouth College in the 1970s. Knowing some of the details of her life, its easy to understand how Erdrich can write of the pain her characters suffer.
This is a read thats gonna stay with me for a long, long time. Starr is a 16yearold girl who has witnessed two of her best friends deaths in her lifetime. The first was Natasha, who was shot in a driveby when she was 10. The second was Kahlil, and this is where our story begins. Kahlil was shot by a police officer, who pulled him and Starr over one night even though they had done nothing wrong. Kahlil was dragged out of the car and was perceived as a threat without reason. Then, the cop assumed Kahlils hairbrush was a gun, got scared, and shot Kahlil three times in the back, with Starr there to witness it all. Now, Starr has to speak out in order to create the change needed to ensure that this never happens again. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, this book addresses racism in ways Ive never seen in literature before. For one, it shines a light on all minorities, attacking stereotypes and showing an alliance between these alienated groups. Second, it shows how easy it is to get involved and help remove this stigma associated with minorities. With steps as small as just staying informed on current events issues and reading multiple sides to a story before forming an opinion, or speaking out when you see something unjust, you can make a difference too, and this book makes you want to do that. I also notice sometimes that those who are for the Black Lives Matter movement tend to be antiwhite or put the blame on all white people for the hardships minorities go through. This book avoids that completely. Starr has a white boyfriend, for example, and he is an informed, supportive character throughout. He loves Starr for who she is, and she loves him too. There are ignorant white characters as well, but this book also shows that ignorance can take place on both sides. Theres a white character who makes racist remarks and takes the side of the officer in Kahlils death, and there is a black man in Starrs neighborhood snitching on drug lords on live TV, which does not help Kahlils case at all. Overall, this book provides a very realistic, eyeopening view of what minorities in America face on a regular basis. It can be shocking at times, but this is definitely a necessary read that I feel everyone should pick up at least once.
Review originally posted at The StarryEyed Revue. So, I was a naysayer in the beginning. I was burned out on vampires and wasnt willing to give the Vampire Academy series the respect it deserved. It wasnt until I got a deal on the audiobook for the first installment in the series that I gave it a chance and decided Id been missing out. Now imagine my surprise and excitement when I found out that the author had created a spinoff series featuring secondary characters from VA. Me  a nonbeliever  had stumbled upon not one but TWO awesome series, all thanks to a sale. I love it when that happens! But then I remembered how Last Sacrifice ended, and my heart broke again. If you have not read the VA series yet, I do not advise starting this series yet. Mead does her summation thing again, but very briefly, so it would be best to familiarize yourself with the characters and backstory from the Vampire Academy world first. Trust me on this. I really thought Id miss Rose as the main character, but Sydneys voice is just as fantastic, if not better. Her snark and overanalysis of the world made for a very entertaining narration. I liked her when she was simply helping out Rose in VA, but I loved her in Bloodlines. She has to contend with a lot of issues that make her uneasy and test her loyalties, and she does it all while dressed like an accountant. You can take the girl out of the alchemist world, but you cant take the alchemist out of the girl. I only want to touch on the relationships and friendships briefly because I feel most anything I say will be a spoiler if you havent read the Vampire Academy series. And if you havent, what are you waiting for? Didnt I already tell you I was converted by a mere audiobook?? So, yeah, back to the relationships. I dont think Ive ever said, Oh, huh, I did not see that coming, to any of the relationships in Meads books, but thats because they are so wellthough out. The relationships in VA develop over time, usually with me muttering to myself, Are those two ever going to make out? Even friendships dont happen immediately. The plot may not be the most realistic ever, especially when you consider that there are good vampires and bad vampires in the world of VA, but at least the bonds between characters are. I think I gave all of the VA series four out of five stars. Youll notice that Bloodlines got five. Thats cause I like this series EVEN MORE than VA. I dont know if it was the introduction of Sydney as the protagonist or the fact that there was a lot more Adrian to feast upon, but I loved every second of this book. I received an ARC of this novel through a giveaway from Jess at Gone with the Words.
This review was originally posted on Bedtime Bookworm  This is the second book in The Lunar Chronicles series. There may be spoilers in this review for the previous books in this series.  Loved It! This book was just as fantastic as the first book, if not even better! Once again, Marissa Meyer deftly weaves a story that is a mix of many genres to create a unique world with unique characters. Im incredibly impressed with her ability to turn a retelling into a completely new and fresh story while still maintaining so many elements of the original story. The Audiobook I did a mix of audiobook and physical book at the same time for this book, as I did with Cinder. The narrator throughly impressed me with her ability to create different voices for the characters. There are twice as many characters in this story than in the first book because of the addition of the new storyline about Scarlet. I was able to keep all the voices separate in my mind due to the talents of the narrator! She also did a far better job with the various accents than I could do in my head. I really stink at accents  I loved her french accent for Scarlet and her grandmother. The Story The first half of the story is a little slower than the second half as the new storyline is being added into Cinders story. However, somewhere around the middle of the book, it became impossible to put down. The pacing really picks up and the storyline gets really exciting and gripping. I love this world and Im excited to see where the story goes! The Characters I loved Scarlet as a strong female lead. She was different enough from Cinder while having a lot of similar qualities that I enjoy seeing in female characters. I really like Wolf as well, although I was definitely unsure of him for a while. I was really intrigued by the wolflike characters  I thought that Meyers had somehow brought werewolves into this world! Discovering how these characters fit into this world was one of my favorite parts of the story  just another example of how Marissa Meyer defies genres! In Summary This series is a retelling that has a little bit of scifi, urban fantasyparanormal, and dystopianpost apocalyptic elements all rolled into one, and it is done so well that it blows me away! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys these genres because I think they will enjoy the crossover in genres as much as I did. I picked up Cress shortly after finishing Scarlet as part of my Make Me Read It Readathon  I was so happy continue the series right away. I only recently found out that there are some novellasshort stories written for this series. Do you guys recommend any of those? How do I get them?? Are you a fan of this series?
Okay, fine. Maybe my expectations for this book got the best of me. Aside from the gorgeous cover, I was particularly on edge when I learned that this book is about parallel dimensions and alternate universes. I dont know what I was thinking or hoping for but I really expected a bit more explanations on the intricacies of mutidimensional travel. I guess I really wanted to read about absurd, crazy and probable theories about this branch of science. Given this, I was gravely disappointed when I started reading the book. For me, it lack that spark of worldbuilding and the universe was shown to us sparsely. But I do understand why it was like this. Since the story was from the point of view of someone more inclined to the arts, of course she wouldnt be able to give readers detailed descriptions of her world in terms of science. Once I got past my expectations, I was able to accept the story better. Okay, this is a romance book. That part was clear from the beginning. But as always, I hated that it had to be a lovetriangle. Again, ignoring that fact, I was able to appreciate what the book is trying to tell its readers. It questions the possibility of a multidimensional universe with an infinite number of worlds that contains another version of ourselves. It also focused on how it is possible that we live an alternate life where everything is different, yet deep within our cores, there is a part of us that is common to all versions and this is what makes us connected to our other selves. One of my really favorite part of the book is how it talks about the blending of art and science. These are two very different areas of thought, and yet the author was able to create a story that mixes the two in such a beautiful way. Its a playful combination of two ideas that doesnt fit perfectly, yet could coexist well enough beside each other. Id like to think of science and art as complimentary lovers. Not very much alikeat times, even opposing each otherbut given a chance to go together, could blend perfectly into a spectacular thing. Over all, I still enjoyed the story, the adventures, and the different worlds presented. Id give it a 45 and I would surely still read the sequel.
44.5 What the hell was that?!?! stars I finished this book on Friday night and yet I am STILL trying to come to terms with it. Monsters dont always lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they hide in plain sight. The story centers around AlexaLexi Ballentine, an American woman living in Australia. Lexi is a social worker with a heart of gold. She is fiercely protective of the kids she interacts with, and extremely responsible when it comes to her job. She also has two best friends that love and adore her. Life is pretty good for Lexi, except she has a stalker. Twitch has been following Lexi for awhile. He is always off in the distance. Watching. Waiting. Their paths finally cross when Twitch saves Lexi from an assault. Finally the man that has clearly been hunting Lexi introduces himself to her world, and she is instantly captivated with him. Theres something animalistic about this man. Something I want to be a part of. Something I want to be included in. Hes a force of nature. But Twitch is a far cry from a knight in shining armour. He is dark. Dangerous. Dirty. You feeling uncomfortable? I immediately nod. Squeezing my ass once more, he places his lips at the shell of my ear. Good. Get used to it. Because Im going to do bad things to you. But Twitch has he reasons for inserting himself in Lexis life. And the power that he wields over her mind, body, and heart threaten to shatter the life that Lexi has made for herself.... I really enjoyed this book. Twitch was a total enigma and I was instantly captivated by him. I also really loved Lexi. She has a good heart and head on her shoulders. Unfortunately some events and outofcharacter moments held me back from a full 5 stars. My main issues were things that Lexi chose to ignorenot act on when she discovered a BIG revelation about Twitch and his profession. I assumed that being as responsible as she was that this would have caused more of an issue but it was kind of just slid under the rug. I was also a little disappointed by the pacing of their relationship. I would have liked to see a little more build up. It felt like the moment the two of them come together happened REALLY fast, and that again seemed out of character for Lexi. Also as much as I REALLY enjoyed Twitch his reasoning was confusing and vague and it wasnt until the very end that I felt that I understood him a little more. Some more of his POV and back story would have been awesome and helpful. Also, that ending. Holy cow. It was resolved but I was far from satisfied. Raw is a book that I think is worthy of a sequel. There were too many things for me that I feel needed to be looked into further. Overall I was really pleased with Raw and cannot wait to read more from this author.
5 stars!  Thats all there is. I AM ABSOLUTELY HEARTBROKEN!!!! BY HOW GREAT!!!!! THIS BOOK WAS!!!!!!!!! Ive previously said that TDT was my favorite TRC book, but now that The Raven King is out and Ive read it, I take it all back. This one is my favorite. This one takes the cake. This is the book deserving of my tears of laughter and love. I had so many expectations regarding this final installment, and literally all of them were met. I couldnt have asked for a better conclusion to one of my favorite YA series. I really really couldnt. This was just... It was so wonderful. And Im so sad its over. Im actually fighting the urge to go back to the beginning and read it all over again, I loved it so much. The Raven King had all the elements that made me fall in love with this series: it was creepy, magical, unique, and fascinating. The narrative was engaging, the writing was beautiful, and the pacing was just right and kept me on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire time. In the space of 438 pages I felt both elated and heartbroken, spellbound and creeped out, anxious and at peace. Im happy to say this was still very much a character driven story. Everything the characters had been through in the previous books led them to this point. To The Raven King. It was such a delight as a reader to be able to see how much theyd developed since the first book; how much theyd learned and changed. And all of that just made me love them more, love this book more. And I wouldnt be me if I didnt talk about LGBT representation! So without giving away too much: I was so very happy with the way Stiefvater wrote both Ronan and Adam. And if you love them both as characters and together, you wont be disappointed. Their interactions were actually one of my favorite things in the entire book, and Im still left smiling whenever I think of them. For the last few chapters, they did bring me to tears. Not only because of what happened, but because it meant I was close to the end, close to saying goodbye to this world that I love so much. And I did say goodbye, but the epilogue made it a bittersweet one. But it also made me realize that this wasnt really over, as stories and dreams live inside us for as long as well let them. Beginnings and endings as far as the eye could see.  Review of The Raven Boys  Review of The Dream Thieves Series: 4 and last in The Raven Cycle series. POV: Various POVs and they were all wonderful. Content Warnings: Gore. Mentions of past abuse. Cliffhanger: No. HEA: Im gonna go with: yes!
okay... Im fine... I cant believe I already finished it, I waited so long for this. Book hangover right there. PLEASE COME TALK ABOUT IT WITH ME I LOVE the Blackthorns  so much. And Julian is definitely my favourite for now, like I dont know, he surprised me a lot? I was expecting another WillJace or a nice kinda boring character but he turned out to be so interesting. He broke my heart so many times in this book, he deserves all the love and hugs you can give him. He loves his family so much and that makes him do some pretty manipulative and cold stuff. I feel like he is the most important character of this book, take him away and the others all fall apart. Mark too won my heart, I just wanted someone to go back in time and prevent him from being taken away. Emma is amazing and so are all the other children. The characters felt real, I could relate to them in a way I couldnt relate to Clary, Jace or Will. I hope we will have more of Ty in the next book, I really like him, I have a feeling hes going to have an interesting relationship with Kit. The villains reveal was pretty cool because rather unexpected, I was shocked wich is a good thing but a tiny bit disappointed too because I liked the character. The few negative points for me: the trope between the books are still pretty similar in a sense and I do have the sensation of being lectured on the shadowhunter world I know its necessary for those who have not read the other series but still. Then the parabatai rule does not make so much sense to me... I mean, I get that the stronger the bond the stronger the power but even before they realised they had fallen in love, Emma and Julian were pretty committed to each other. As were Will and Jem, and I dont see why being in love suddenly makes that love so much stronger and dangerous. It kind of negates the love of family over romantical bonds. Also I hope the end wasnt a preparation for a love triangle knowing Cassandra, it totally is, which once again is starting to be repetitive, first because it would make no sense considering what happened in this book, second because its weird I dont know, Im not really thrilled about it, its the cruelest thing Emma can do to Julian. Ill definitely be mad at her if she takes Mark upon his offer, because shes not only destroying her relationship with Jules by doing so because in that case okay, shes just trying to protect him but also Marks relationship with Jules, and this is a bit selfish, especially considering Mark doesnt even know that. Unecessary drama. A little thought for Kieran, it makes me really sad to know hes going to have to endure the Hunt on his own from now on, even though its a good thing Mark freed himself from him.
Hillbilly Elegy is a memoir of sorts by J.D. Vance. It talks about his childhood and his family in Appalachia where the term hillbilly seems to be a name to take pride in. I will admit that I had heard a ton about this book in the aftermath of the election in order to help explain some of Trumps base. There are many different factors but this book definitely explains some of those factors and is fascinating in that regard. Vance grew up in Ohio and Kentucky in areas marred by economic and often social despair so he if very familiar with the subject. The best books for me are the ones that force you to chew things over and to think long after you close the book. This is one of those books for me. It makes you go from understanding to trying to mull over fixes to being bewildered about what youre reading. Even after reading this, there is a confusing juxtaposition present. On one hand, this group will push away outsiders without a second glance but drop everything to help others in the community if needed. They want help but claim to be against receiving anything called a hand out. Its a complicated issue and anecdotally, Vance seeks to give us a little insight into how this happens. Many in the community that he grew up in will not have the chances that Vance had. Vance joined the military and went to school and was able to start a good, solid career through having support but also a lot of luck. The differences between his personal story against the stories of many of the people in his family and friends that he grew up with are especially stark. This book did leave me with the question of what do we do to overcome the obstacles in this book. While I feel like I understand a little bit better, I still have a lot of questions. For me, its not a question of how you get people to feel differently and to therefore vote differently but its more of a question as to how you fix the ills that the people in the book face. By attacking those problems, you start to change mindsets but this book really doesnt address that. This book is very much a good picture of a place that was unfamiliar to me.
You can find my full review on Books and Ladders but be warned it is a monster. A full 2300 words of fangirl trash. I just dont know what to say right now. I guess I should start with a big thank you to Justin who had a preorder giveaway that I won and thus got this book out of the deal. World Building So one thing I wasnt keen on in the Grisha series was the world building. I thought one of the struggles in the series was that either characters lacked development because they were just pieces to create the world or vice versa. But I think because there wasnt much to add to this setting, since it was already in the Grishaverse, that the characters could really shine. And trust me, shine they did  sometimes a little too brightly. But we will get there. I liked Ketterdam, I thought it was a good extension of what we learned in the Grisha series, but I am also a little like unsure about it. I feel like there is more to learn, more to explore, but am hopeful for the next book. Characters The characters were so much grittier and dirtier than those we encountered in the Grisha series. Each had dark pasts and even darker presents, but they were so fleshed out. I didnt roll my eyes once at what a character said or did like I did while reading about Alina. I thought that each character was so well developed and I could see how this rag tag team of misfits perfectly in my mind. Honestly, this is a huge cast of characters but Leigh does it so beautifully that you root for all the characters to succeed and be happy and find peace and you just know that isnt going to happen for all of them. They are all such beautiful disasters and I cant help but wonder what their future will be. Plot I thought this plot was much tighter than what we had seen in the Grisha series. There was a logical sequence and the twists and turns were all in a single direction to take us from point A to point B. The only thing I would say is that I was a tad disappointed that everything was explained to me so quickly. I wanted to have a bit more time to try and figure out exactly how they were able to do certain things and if characters did certain things on purpose or by accident. I felt like the mystery sort of aspect that comes along with these types of books was taken away from me at some points because it was told to me right away. I thought a lot of the directions the plot took were obvious if you were reading closely enough but there were still some that took me by complete surprise. I literally have no words though. Like it took me a very long time to write this because I needed to think of something to say other than Go read this because its awesome even though that is very true. I applaud this book and not so secretly wish I had been the one to think of it first. But I wouldnt have trusted this story or these characters in anyone elses hands other than Leigh Bardugo.
This is a review of both Becoming Calder and Finding Eden. I felt like I could write a better review if I combined the books. Earlier this year, the book club I belong to read Archers Voice. It was the first Mia Sheridan book I had read. I loved it. I was hooked on Mias writing style. I think I finished it in about three hours. When I heard she was coming out with a new duology this year, I knew it was going to be good. I thought that there was no way she would be able to write another book that I liked as much as Archers Voice. Well I was wrong. I liked Becoming Calder and Finding Eden more than Archers Voice. It ties with Ugly Love by Colleen Hoover for my favorite book of the year. The books also put Mia with Colleen as my favorite author of all time. Cults have always been a subject that I am interested in. I think its fascinating to see how some people have crazy thoughts that gain them power. Its always interesting to see other people being charmed enough that they too believe those thoughts. Mia Sheridan doesnt just give you an insight to what that is like. She makes you feel like you are there living this lifestyle with Calder, Eden, and Xander. Every horrible thing that happens to them, I felt like I was right beside them experiencing it. At one point during Becoming Calder, the emotional aspect got to be too much for me and I had to set the book down for a few. Thats how intricate and beautiful the writing is. I have an ARC so I cant share quotes from the book, but I really wish I could. I am so happy that Mia decided to release Becoming Calder and Finding Eden simultaneously. That wait for Finding Eden would have killed me. I love how things were wrapped up in Finding Eden. You really get to see Eden grow as a character. She becomes a strong independent woman. There were several twists and turns in the series, especially in Finding Eden, that left me speechless. Theres a scene towards the end of Finding Eden that left me gasping. The whole time I was reading it I thought WTF, that cant be true! Thanks to Mia Sheridan, I will never look at peaches, morning glories, and butterscotch candies the same way again. I think I definitely need a bed of healing. If there is one duology I wish I could put on everyones Kindles and make them read, it would definitely be this one. You truly come out of the experience a better person with a new outlook on life. I cant recommend Becoming Calder and Finding Eden enough.
Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to the food markets who signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke, when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own and access to knowledge. but all of that is gone now. This book is certainly not what I expected when I began reading it, but as a lover of the dystopian genre, I was told by many book friends that I needed to read this, as it was a classic dystopian. The Handmaids Tale is so different from any of books Ive previously read in this genre, mainly because Offred, the main character and narrator remembers how the world was before because she lived in it. That is one of many reasons that I really enjoyed this book because she flashes back to before and even during to explain her life and how things were before and how they came to become as they are now. I will admit that although I loved the book and I really enjoy Atwoods writing, I read this book slower than I normally do and Im not really sure why. So we meet Offred after the world as we know it has ended and the Republic of Gilead has been established and she has just arrived at her new station with the Commander. as the book moves along, she explains how she got to where she is, what daily life is like, what her hopes are about the future and what happened to her husband and daughter. I will admit that the book can be quite sad and depressing, especially as Offred is detailing how the Republic treats women. The Republic has gone backwards if you will by trying to reestablish more tradition values and roles of men and women. Offred also explains what happened to the world to cause birth rates to decline which is what prompted the beginning of this dystopian society. This book is also a bit scary because when you really think about the circumstances that led to the way the Republic is formed and operated, it is completely possible that it could happen. The lives of these poor women is almost unbelievable at times. The book is filled with symbolism and the Republic has taken verses from the Christian Bible and altered them to fit their needs. This book is filled with longing and loneliness, but it will make you, as it does Offred, appreciate the simple things that she once took for granted. The ending was not what I expected, but now that it has been a few days, I think its absolutely brilliant and I look forward to reading more by this author in the future. Happy reading!
My Rating: 4.55 Lovely, sweet, and surprising, this book is a historical romance you dont want to miss. Season for Scandal was a wonderful romance, one that I really enjoyed. Loved this book! Jane was a very sensible heroine. And I mean that in the best of ways because, after reading so many historical romance, you get a little frustrated with the melodramatic, overly emotional heroines. Theyre wonderful, but they can get to be a bit much. Jane was actually reasonable. I really liked that, when she realized her marriage was not working in the way she wanted it to, she did something about it rather than just sulk. But, that is also my only issue with the book. Jane knew what she was getting into when she got married and she said she would be okay with it, but it wasnt long before she went back on her word. And, because of that, she hurt Edmund. Other than that, I really liked her. She was a lovely, likable heroine and I thought she was great. Edmund was the sweetest! I dont think its even possible to find someone kinder, sweeter, or more honorable than him. It took all of two pages for me to adore him. Edmunds family has a very scandalous past that involves treason, adultery, and several other crimes. And, he blames himself for part of it. So, he tries to make up for that by being a true gentleman. And, he feels like he cant be loved, so he does his best to make other people happy to make up for it. I cant stress enough how absolutely sweet this man was. He was wonderful and adorable and absolutely amazing. Loved him! The romance was lovely. It was definitely sweet, with Edmunds inability to be anything other than adorable and Jane having been in love with him for years. And, the chemistry between them was undeniable. Though, I would say in a way thats more sensuous than hot, which I really liked. These two were lovely together. The plot was fast paced and I was hooked the entire way through. The secrets of Edmunds family were a huge shock. To say they were a scandalous family would be an understatement. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was wonderful. Season for Scandal was a fantastic historical romance. I really enjoyed reading this lovely book. Lovers of the genre, you dont want to miss this book because its absolutely wonderful. Thanks to Netgalley and Zebra for a copy!
We swoon with the thickness of our own tongue when we say, I love you, as in the eye of a child lost a long while will be found the contraction of that distance  a child going small in the claws of a beast, coming furiously up the furlongs of the iris. We are but skin about a wind, with muscles clenched against mortality. We sleep in a long reproachful dust against ourselves. We are full to the gorge with our own names for misery. Life, the pastures in which the night feeds and prunes the cud that nourishes us to despair. Life, the permission to know death. We were created that the earth might be made sensible of her inhuman taste; and love that the body might be so dear that even the earth should roar with it. Yes, we who are full to the gorge with misery, should look well around, doubting everything seen, done, spoken, precisely because we have a word for it, and not its alchemy. Third time is apparently the charm for this, as I finally feel like I grasped the majority of what Barnes is doing throughout my reading. Im not sure if its a growing familiarity with the text, or this specific version  the Dalkey version is the original version prior to Eliot and Colemans edits and suggestions to get the book past the censors  and it would take a fourth read going back to my NDP paperback to suss out the truth of it. That doesnt mean it all is clear  I particularly like some of the textual endnotes that quote Barnes about specific passages where she claims the intent is obvious but she still restates the line in a different way, each time her restatement does nothing to unobscure the meaning. Im not sure if Barnes was coming from the same place as Joyce, but it strikes me that Barnes appears to make the same connection between obscurity and the night that Joyce did when he was intentionally obscuring passages in the Wake. There is this idea of unknowability tied in with the night  Barnes has OConnor speak to this in the Watchman, what of the Night? chapter. There is a great deal of anguish in this book, especially around failingfailed destructive relationships  the book is in part written in response to Barnes failed relationship with Thelma Wood  and the pain Barnes pours out on these pages is at times overwhelming. Im not sure that one could describe this book as a joy to read, but Im in awe of it each time I pick it up. There are chapters and passages that are merely well written, but so much of this book is staggeringly good, with paragraph after paragraph of prose poem brilliance, Ill likely continue to revisit this as the years go by. And this version is out of print, but well worth tracking down. Not just for the version itself, but for the absolutely indispensable appendices and a great introduction that track the textual changes through versions, provide in depth background into the changes, and finally actual annotations for the text. The last portion of the book is a reproduction of the only remaining fragments 72 pages of the earlier editions of Nightwood. This really is a lovely scholarly edition of this work, I wish more books of its kind existed. Now, ... the end   mark my words   now nothing, but wrath and weeping!
MY OPINION:  I really wanted to rate this book a five stars but I just couldnt. BECAUSE WHAT? WARNER?? Okay, okay, lemme explain. We already know from the first book that Warner Aaron can touch Juliette for some unexplained reason. Now in this book we find out why... He has some ability that I dont feel like trying to explain because, quite frankly, a lot of it didnt really make sense to me but that might have been because I honestly didnt care Um, so this book went way too fast for me. This happened and then three pages later, something else happened that just ruined the story. There were way too many plot twists and cliffhangers THOUGH I MUST ADMIT THOSE WERE THE MOST INTERESTING And what happened to Adam? He was too needy, he got angry for no reason, and he was no longer that amazing sweet dude from the first book that I had come to love... ANYWAYS, I still enjoyed reading this book and I started Ignite Me right afterward. I probably wont be reading the novellas, frankly because I cant find them. Juliette was much more independent and she finally came to terms with... herself. And who she is. And I really liked that part. She learned that she has to live her own life and she even learned to stop thinking of herself as this evil monster. I really liked reading about her a lot more. The writing style of this book was still the same. And I know I said I didnt like it before, but now it just seemed so unique and I really liked it, especially the constant repetition and strikethroughs. Warner. I hated him before I think I said that but Im too lazy to go check that out but after reading this book, I like him a lot better. I still love Adam the best, but Aaron was a better character and I will be fine if Aaron and Juliette end up together instead of my original shipping with Adam and Juliette. I honestly will be good either way. Now, Kenji. I HATED HIM BEFORE. But after reading this book, I feel like his character and my opinion for him changed a lot more than before. I really started to appreciate Kenjis constant humor and friendliness, and I really like his ability because it is SO helpful. James was still as adorable and amazing as ever and I still really liked him. I would have put some quotes in, but I dont have the book with me : And that kind of makes me sad because that was such a good book to show examples of amazing writing with! I know this is short, but I have another review to write and I am so excited about that. I also am trying to shorten my reviews because I feel like they are all way too long. I would recommend this book to Fantasy lovers :D Main Character: Juliette Sidekicks: Adam, Aaron, Kenji, James, etc Villains: Anderson, etc Fantasy Elements: This book had fanatic abilities, characters, and settings
More reviews here! mybookliferead.blogspot.com Trilogies, Ive found, usually get worse and worse as they go on, until you get to the last one and you want to throw it across the room. cough Mockingjay Marie Lu, though, amazes me with her talent and what a phenomenal finale she crafts to her series, and the trilogy actually gets better as it goes on. The Ups: Everything. There are so many emotions coursing through my heart, so many thoughts I have about the story. Lets see if I can attempt to organize them all. The world that Marie Lu creates is so incredibly real. Not just beautifully described or easy to picture but frighteningly real. I can see our world now coming to the world she creates. The failure of what was once the United States, the rise of the countries Africa and Antarctica, the political and social aspects, there are things in the Legend books that resemble authentic government today. The sectors, the difference between the rich and poor, the plagues, everything in the book has a genuine purpose. The reality of the novel is nerve wracking. The characters are absolutely phenomenal. Day and June have such distinct voices, and it really enhanced the story, seeing it from both perspectives. Their struggles and pains were incredibly relatable and believable. The love between them wasnt stupid, but I could really feel the bond between them, and it was real and genuine and great. Anden was another of my personal favorite characters, because I think that he really had his struggles that he was trying to beat, and doing that while trying to save a country going to the dogs is heroic. The plot, oh my gosh. I actually cried in this book. And I didnt cry while reading TFIOS. So this is pretty much a super emotional book, man. There is just such a connection with me and the characters, and the overwhelming feeling of love and sympathy and pain for these characters made the journey through the book meaningful. The ending was beautiful, and I cant believe Im parting with the Legend world. The Downs: I think that there may have been a very small amount of sentences and phrases that caught me off guard because they didnt seem to fit in with the characters and such, but it was very minimal. Overall: The best final book to a trilogy that I have ever read. Also possibly the best science fiction book Ive ever read. Absolutely amazing. Mini shoutout to my amazing friend Azaan for lending his signed copy to me...that takes courage and a heckload of trust.
There was beauty in the idea of freedom, but it was an illusion. Every human heart was chained by love. I cant believe I didnt write a review for this one last year but better late than never, right? Besides, Ive reread Lady Midnight around two weeks ago so here we go. Lady Midnight is most likely my favorite Cassandra Clare book. I do love this book and its characters so freaking much. I gotta say I only love Jace Herondale more than I do love Julian Blackthorn. Cassandras world building has always been absolutely amazing but I feel like she got even better while creating this part of her Shadowhunters world. Also the characters got way more developed and complex, in my opinion. It was one of the things that made me love this book so much. 1. Emma and Julian share such an important and precious bond. I absolutely adore how much they care about each other. Of course its quickly clear that its way more than a parabatai bond. Like is it even possible to not love them and to not wish them all the great things in this world?? I dont think so! I feel like this the most tragic love story in Cassandras book. OF COURSE RIGHT AFTER WILL, TESSA AND JEM. I KNOW NOTHING CAN BEAT THEM. 2. Julian overall. He is such a well written and complex character. We quickly learn that he is the one whos in charge, that hes the one who takes care of his siblings since hes 12 years old. The fact that he is handling all of it so well and always puts the others first makes him such an amazing person. Thats what made me love him so much. Overall, their entire family is simply amazing and each family member adds something so important to the story. 3. Mentall Illness rep. I was surprised to see the mentall illness rep but I am so glad about it. 4. I didnt trust Kieran at all. Neither did I like Perfect Diego. I just had a pretty bad feeling about both of them while reading the book and rereading Lady Midnight didnt change that feeling at all. 5. I gotta be honest at first I didnt know if I wanted to trust Mark, simply because we didnt know how much the time away from his family changed him. The moment it was obvious that he was going to stick with his family was the moment I really started to like him. He had so many hilarious scenes, it was just a joy to read them! By now I really, really do love his character. Lady Midnight never fails at making me laugh, cry, smile and think. Its the type of book that you cant put down because it just never gets boring. It doesnt have any scenes that make you think uh okay can we skip this part?. I also absolutely loved that we got to see Clary, Jace, Magnus, Tessa and Jem.
This book is a long, wild roller coaster ride. Ive said that about a book before, but I really mean it for this one. Winter follows our favorite heroes from the previous books and continues with the story of Winter, a young princess of Luna who has Lunar Sickness a.k.a. going crazy due to lack of bioelectric manipulating. Its a long 800 pages, but you wouldnt think so just by looking at it. I actually held it up next to Cress and they are honestly about the same size. Cress is about 500. Winter is about 800. That 300 page difference should make it bigger, but not in this case. But enough about size. Winter takes the readers through a whole planet that has yet to be fully touched upon. Luna. The moon kingdom. You really begin to understand the make up and even class difference between the people of Luna. Its a dazzling and terrible place where the weak are made to work and the strong are allowed to party. Kind of like how the poor are made to work and the rich are made to party in society in the real world. Actually, to be totally honest, Winter feels dystopian. The different sectors are labeled districts, the rich and powerful dress in ridiculous clothing to match the ridiculousness of their status and they spend most of their time in the dome of Artemisia the capital. Sound similar to Panem? The characters of the Lunar Chronicles are all fantastic and loveable for their quirks and I even have an Iko ship. Iko and Kinny. I really think he could learn to love her for all her wiring and synthetic skin. Faulty personality chip or not. And they could adopt. Yess. If anyone believes this book to be boring, you seriously need to chil. Theres so much going on, constantly. As soon as things start to calm down, they pick right back up again and youre on the edge of your seat, praying that no one loses their life. Or their limbs. The ending wasnt exactly what I expected but thats not a bad thing. Im actually really relieved because the ending that I was thinking wouldve been kind of a let down after all the blood, death, and pain that occurs in this book. Lost limbs, too. This is one of the best series that Ive read. Im a sucker for fairy tale retellings but the way that Marissa Meyer tells these fairy tales are so addicting and unique. Im looking forward to her Alice in Wonderland retelling series and I have one request PLEASE DO BEAUTY AND THE BEAST AND THE LITTLE MERMAID. I would love to see what she does with them.
I am still in shock over the sheer creativity and quality of this book. When I read the first book in this fantasy series, Throne of Glass, I felt a certain standard had been set for the rest of the series. A bad ass girl caught between two honourable, handsome men while having her own secrets about what she has discovered about the King. While this may be the backbone of what the sequel, Crown of Midnight, in essence is, it was done in such an impactful, unique and exciting way. In this book we learn quite a lot about Celaena Sardothien, some things amazing and others a little unnerving. Thats something I love about her, the fact that she grips me in and almost commands me to read the story about her. No one can really stand against her though anyway. Her relationships with other characters are incredibly moving and heartbreaking, and the dramatics of how Celaena reacts to these tragedies are just gripping. I was often frustrated when I had to stop reading, how dare my life keep going before I got to find out what happened next! The side characters are also all becoming individually interesting characters. I highly disliked Dorian in the first book as I found him unoriginal and boring, however aspects of this story made him quite an exciting character to read about. Im happy he has his own storyline to follow, I look forward to seeing where he goes from here. Chaol is such an interesting character. I say interesting as he is not really that likeable nor unlikeable. He his a highly flawed and yet highly respectable character. I never know how to feel about him and though he frustrates me at times, he never fails to entertain nor shock me. But there is a kindness in him that I do love. In terms of Nehemia, she is a legendary character I have loved from her very first scene. Brave, mature and selfless. What more can I say? The story itself was just incredibly fun. I was always sucked in and excited for what was next. This is the type of story that has amazing characters and amazing storyline. Im so happy and thankful to have these two elements so strong and working together to create such an amazingly thought out and moving series. I will definitely move onto the next book tomorrow.
Holy smokes this book was absolutely amazing. If were going to be honest I thought I was going to hate this book. Why? Well it was getting a lot of hype and many a time its a hit or a miss. Thankfully this one was a complete hit for me and I fell in love with this story. Elisa is a fantastic character who I fell in love with from the first page, literally. Elisa is a heavyset princess who was given a gift from the gods in the form of a stone in her belly. Elisa has dedicated her life to learning about what her purpose in life will be. Elisa has had a difficult life, her mother is gone, her father and sister distant. Elisa is sent off to marry a man shes never met and doesnt love at all. Elisa goes through so many trials, including being kidnapped and leading a revolution and falling in love with one of her kidnappers, except things dont always go as planned and Elisa is forced to face a darkness beyond her imagining. I loved Elisas character she has little power or training and yet kicks some major butt all on her own. She is a fantastic character as she strived at everything she did, she never gave up on anything she tried. I loved her perseverance and genuinely just everything about her. The Girl of Fire and Thorn is an amazing story. Rae Carson perfectly crafted the most mystical charming world Ive ever read. The story was flawless and magical and I loved it. Honestly I cannot brag enough about this book, Im so glad I finally got around to reading it. Some characters I loved, some I hated, which means flawless writing on Rae Carsons part. The whole story was a whirlwind of drama, adventure, magic and love. I would definitely have your Kleenex ready because there are moments where you will need them. This story has so many interesting twists and turns you wont know what will happen next or who the bad people were or when danger or a romantic moment would strike. I cant say this story could get any better, because it seriously couldnt be. All in all I love this book so so sooo much. I bought the other three books right away and cannot wait to dive into the magical world of Thorn and Fire again. Gods will. How many times have I heard someone declare their understanding of this thing I find so indefinable?
I got this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review The easiest way to steal something, is for it to be given willingly. Cath is the daughter of a Marquess in the magical land of Wonderland. A passionate baker, Cath is rather surprised to hear of the Kings intention to propose to her at the Royal Ball. Distressed, she runs from the palace, before King has the opportunity to do so, and comes across the royal Joker, who had intrigued her during his performance earlier that night. After the unexpected meeting, Cath returns home and wakes up the next day to the news of a Jabberwock attack moments after shed ran from the palace. Heartless is the story of the Queen of Hearts before she became mad and hungry for revenge. My knowledge of the world of Alice in Wonderland was not much before I read Alice by Christina Henry and Heartless, which probably contributed to my confusion as to who was Lady Pinkerton. Although I was thoroughly enjoying the story, there was something at the back of my mind preventing me from thinking this was a great retelling. It was my own fault that I was slow to connect the dots when the hints were there staring me in the face. As soon as I realised Cath was indeed the Queen of Hearts, everything made much more sense to me and I was able to enjoy the rest of the book peacefully. Cath is definitely a complex character, very threedimensional, but I do have one comment about her shift in character. It didnt feel fluid at first, I felt that it was very sudden and could have been managed better. Other than that, the only other thing I can say is that the recurring repetition of how Cath was more than the other girls did annoy me. I quite liked Jest and the idea that he came to Hearts to get the heart of the Queen. The irony of how things unfolded was quite painful to deal with as the story progressed. I have no idea if Jest even existed in the original story but he was one of my favourite characters in the book. I found it odd that the Caterpillar had such an insignificant role in the story. Having watched the animated Disney movie and the live action directed by Tim Burton, the Caterpillar seemed to have a stronger role in the story than it did in Heartless. I cant say it bothered me a lot, as Im as big a fan of the original story, but I did notice that detail. Heartless might be disappointing to those who love Carolls work very dearly, as retellings usually are, but to someone who hasnt, myself included, it was quite enjoyable and engaging. Yet again, Marissa Meyer made us care and even relate to a villainous character and even root for her. Blog . Instagram . Twitter .
5 BEDAZZLING STARS The issue isnt whether he loved you, its how much. Too much. Love can be a poison. I have become a lazy reader this past couple months. I fell into my reading slump all over again. And then this book came out. It is a huge book with a total of more than 600 pages, and in my slump state, I know that I will probably finished the book in a month.. or even more. Well, it turns out that this book was the salvation of my reading slump. Yes, this is going to be a very exciting review. I was trapped. I was trapped inside this house. I might as well have been Under the Mountain; I might as well have been inside that cell again Damn that plotline! If you have read the first book and compare it with Beauty and the Beast like it said to be, than you cant believe how the fairy tale still going on after the second book. It still had the essence of Beauty and the Beast, which was so much better than the first one. In the first book, there wasnt much of the world being described, that most of the time Tamlins court was probably the only thing that we know all about. But in this second book, there were so many characters had been added in so many different part of their world. Where ACOTAR was more on the romance side, ACOMAF was amazingly had the same amount of romance and thrill. Theres also the main characters development. We all know about Feyre changing into something else at the end of the first book. Not just the fact that she became a faerie, but all of the experience she had been through Under the Mountain really changed her attitude. The process of development shed been through in this book was so wonderful, its dark but the journey was so beautiful that in the end she grew mature and became a totally different person than the one we knew on the first book. The plot twist was really unpredictable. I had guessed it, but I wasnt expecting it to be true. When it happened though, it was really frustrating that I wanted to grab the first book and read it all over again with this new plot line mindset. ... you remain your own person. You decide your fateyour choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever. I cant say much about this book without spoiling the excitement but there were so many things going on in the book that I cant sum up in my review. All I can say is this book really blow my mind, and saved me from that frustrating slump. I cant believe I have to wait another year for the third book. READ MORE REVIEWS HERE
This review is also on my blog, My Friends Are Fiction I giving away a hardcover of Clockwork Princess on my blog I try to be as spoiler free as possible in this review which is more a love letter than review. The Story: Its so difficult to write a review for the end of a series and for one you love very deeply. I have been waiting in timid anticipation for this book since I finished Clockwork Prince, my heart still raw after Clare ripped it from me with Wills tale. I felt terrified about what she had planned for this last book, would it live up to the prior two? Would it have enough closure? Would it hurt to read and would the outcome crush me? I am happy to report that I loved every word of Clockwork Princess. I tried to read slowly because I wanted to savor every single word, every sentence. But, once I started to read it just sucked me in and I didnt want to, nor could I stop. I had to know where Clare was going to take Tessa, Will and Jem. I was given the closure I desired but it wasnt a slow read that only focused on tying up loose ends, it was the completion of a journey. It was a full story in and of itself yet wrapped up everything from the prior books. I was swept away from beginning to end. I found myself misty eyed from the first chapter just because I knew it was the last of the series. I didnt want to have to say goodbye to this world and these characters Id come to love greatly. Ive seen that some readers have been iffy about the epilogue but after digesting what I read I am happy with where Clare took the story. The Characters: From the moment Clare introduced me to the characters of Clockwork Angel I fell in love; I became entranced with each of their stories. In Clockwork Princess I felt that the women had the most growth, especially Tessa and Charlotte. I loved watching them stand up to extreme obstacles and fight their own fears. The mysteries surrounding Tessa were answered and I was pleased where Clare took her character. Jem was as wonderful as ever and parts of his story surprised me, Clare has guts and such an over arcing plan for each of her characters. Will, oh Will. He is on my top five favorite characters ever list. The completion of his story left nothing for me to desire, it was done perfectly. Clare had me loving Magnus even more which I didnt think was possible. Not much can be written about the characters without going into spoiler territory but I felt Clare stayed true to the characters she created and really I loved every minute. Final Thoughts: By the Angel, if you have not read this series what are you waiting for? It is a must read.
Ohhhhh... oh my gosh.!!!!!!!! I .. That was so beautiful!!!!! I loved it. All the characters were great and I laughed and was shocked, was confused and very much blown away. I dont want to spoil anything but I will just mostly base this review on the characters and not the plot. Emma Carstairs Emma was a really awesome character. Parbati to Julian Blackthorn where she fall in love with him but it is forbidden. She is so strong and brave and kind and loving and funny. I loved her relationship with Mark and Julian as well as Christina. Emma is smart and I loved her from page 1. She is advantourous and takes risks Mark Blackthorn Mark was a complete surprise to me. I loved him. He was very funny and innocent and aww at the same time. Mark was taken away 5 years ago after the Dark War to Fairie and he is returned in this book but he is messed up. Mark is the eldest of the kids and when he was taken, Julian had to be the parent figure. I definitely liked Mark more than Julian but I also like Julian and all the characters that I am just one big mess. I may just be on the Mark and Emma ship? I am not too sure but by book 2 we will see. The strawberry scene at the resturant Lol. Julian Blackthorn Julian was awesome. I feel his burden that he has to carry and wow. He reminds me a bit of Jem and wow that end... Julian is an artist and a really good one at it. He loves his siblings very much and will do anything for them, which I admired. I also adored his and Emmas relationship. I hope everything turns out well. Christina Rozales I have never really fancied side kick girl characters, except maybe Isabell, but Christina was marvelous. She loved everyone and could fight too! She is from the Mexican inststute and left a relationship with a guy there. I loved Emma and Chris friendship and I loved Mark and Christinas relationship. I felt all warm inside. I dont know how everything will turn out though because... Anyway the plot was so twisty and it was one one helluva ride. I was entertained for every second and I could not predict what would happen next. There are also some new elements introduced. Oh and it had lots of humor!!! I will offically die waiting for book 2.
This review was written for The Review Diaries You can read the full review here I know what youre thinking  how has it taken you so long to get to this series?! And I have no decent excuse. It got tangled up in my head with Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Laini Taylor, and by the time I realised they were two very separate books the ship had sailed and I decided to wait until the full trilogy was out to sit down to read to them. Then I promptly forgot. Until Six of Crows started making exciting waves and I decided that enough was enough and I really ought to get caught up on the Grisha world properly before launching into Six of Crows, and well, here we are. This book had me from the first page. It was just the type of world, mythology, and exciting plot peopled with fascinating characters that I needed to get lost in. I stormed through it virtually in one sitting and loved it thoroughly. It was such a refreshing change to see a gorgeous take on Russia used as the backdrop in Ravka. It leant the book a wonderful freshness and set it apart from so many of the fantasy books Ive read this year. The world building is superb and I loved being immersed in this world, familiarising myself with the history and culture which is all captured so vividly and really adds an additional layer to the story that helps lift it from the page. The characters are all complex and fascinating and I loved Alina from the start. Shes a wonderfully relatable protagonist, filled with flaws and weaknesses as well as strength and determination. I loved watching her come to terms with her past, her present and her future and all the facets of herself that shes kept hidden for years. The only character that I wasnt fussed on was Mal, strangely enough. I cared about him, but I wasnt sold on the romance in the way I was hoping and expecting to be, which was a shame. This is a fantastic start to what Im sure is going to be a fabulous series. Its filled with excitement and drama and magic and I slipped into this world and Alinas life and fell in love. I cannot wait to see what the rest of the trilogy has in store.
3.9 stars This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I picked it up, excited for the Canadian author and the taglines describing it would be for me if I was a fan of Game of Thrones. Well, in many aspects, it did deliver that feel. I read some parts of the book while listening to the god that is Ramin Djawadi compose his GoT masterpieces. This book is a high fantasy whirlwind of travelling and setting up for some higher purpose I hope. There were moments that truly had me gasp in Falling Kingdoms, namely Tobias, Sabina, and Theons deaths, which I was not expecting. I fully thought these people would be crucial to future plots, BUT they were well done in a GRRM PG rating way that eliminated a few potential love interest for a particular main character, in order to be led in one straight direction my thoughts. Other moments had me weeping, like when Emilia died, despite all Cleo went through. And when her father died. THAT ONE GOT ME RIGHT IN THE FEELS . And then there was that one cringeworthy moment that made me lose all compassion for a certain icy bastard. I held onto Magnus throughout his feelings in the first half of the book, but he really became a jackass after Lucia rejected him and totally dark in a way difficult to ever sympathize with him. Was this Rhodes way of introducing a new villain? Or a misunderstood hero? Despite the complexity of the relationships formed and to be formed between all those characters, there were also a couple aspects that made me feel like this book needed a whole lot more editing, in the dialect field. There were some phrases that would never have been said in the way they had in a medievallike setting. Some names were also an issue for m because they seemed too modern, idk. BUT, I think the overall idea behind the story has potential, which is why I bumped it from a 3star to a 3.9star rating. I mean, look at the potential here: A story about sorceresses and sanctuaries that were left for the mortal world. People corrupted by power who destroyed themselves, and left the fate of the worlds magic in objects known as the Kindred. Only certain people would have the power to seek them out and save the world from eternal peril...blah blah blah. You get the point. The bottom line was that it is enjoyable to a certain extent if you can suspend your disbelief to a higher level than you usually do. Final Verdict 7.810: At first glance, theres too many characters with bad names to keep track of. But as you progress, you get a feel for the overall plot and the challenges that the protagonists face. I think its worth checking out.

But when she finds out his thirst for revenge, she realizes his resolve and wonders if her love for him might be enough.A Rogue By Any Other Name is the first in the most newest series by Sarah MacLean. I have to say that I ever since I first read this author....she utterly captivated me instantly with her sharp wit and wonderful written stories that just pulled at my heartstrings. I can honestly say she is at the top of my favorite authors to read and I cant believe that it has taken me so long to get this one read....I truly must be an idiot LOL . Because this books was full of everything that satisfies every romantic notion that made me fall in love with romance novels in the first place. The story has a strong plot with a hero that I fell in lust and love with from the beginning. He is total Alpha and bad boy Rake type. Definitely the irresistable type that I just cant help but love from the first page. Penelope seems in the beginning like there is so much more she wants but feels caged by restrictions by her family and society. But when she marries Michael, we see the true fire beneath the mask, and I started to really like her. She fights for what she really wants and for the love she has for Michael and I just LOVED her for that I just love two strong characters that might not seem good for each other...but in the end are just perfect for each other. There is also such a sexual tension between these two from the beginning, and boy did this story sizzle and spark. A page turner this one....and story that will make you believe in second chances and a love that never dies!!!! A Romance Marvel that will make you pop in delight!
Originally from Shadowhunters Library Click here for my spoilerreview of City of Heavenly Fire Ok, so Im assuming that all of you reading this know how excited I was for the release of this book. I was so excited, that I had a COHF countdown meme which you check out all the posts here, where every week there was a new topic and you would post something for that. When I finally got this book, I was so happy and excited and I started to read it immediately. I got about halfway through the book before I read through the rest of it on Saturday. The question is: Was it a satisfying end to a series? Yes. Yes it was. I would say that this is so much more satisfying than the CP2 ending. Everything just flows together so nicely and beautifully in this final book. If you have any worries that there will be holes and you wont be happy, dont worry. Everything has an ending and there is a clear conclusion to everyone and everything in the series. The things that happened in this book. It was so insane and crazy and I love this book so much. From the battles in this final book to where the gang goes to, we go and see so many crazy things happen in this British accent MASSIVE book. There may be a couple of moments where it is kind of slow, but overall there is something that is always going on in this book, on every page. Whether there is action or characters talking to each other, there is something that is always happening. I think that is all I can really say without spoiling the book, just go pick up this book because everything flows together and the series definitively ends on a satisfying note. I am definitely saying that this book is my favorite in the series, and because of that I give City of Heavenly Fire 55 stars.  61: FINALLY, I FINISHED THIS MONSTER.  526: ITS ALMOST TIME. OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING. WE ARE SO CLOSE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY READ IT. cries cause we are so close  518: Looks like Im stuck with the edition the mundanes will get since BN toke the signed copy off their website. heavy sigh  516: Wow, were only 10 days away from getting this book. THIS WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME.  51 may or may not be exact date: Wow. Its less than a month until this comes out. The end of this is coming sooner than I think any of us wanted it to. When I get the actual book: When Im halfway through the book: Once I finish it: I swear, I dont think Ill be prepared for this book even when I start it and I dont think Ill ever get over this final book.
This review appears on Happy Indulgence, check it out for more reviews! Pivot Point takes a while to get off the ground; it starts off as a contemporary but weaves in elements of the paranormal and mysterysuspense. Im fond of alternate realities like Just Like Fate and Ask Again Later so Pivot Point following this formula, pretty much guaranteed my enjoyment. Unlike the other two alternate reality books I read, Pivot Point uses an intriguing mix of paranormal elements to explain how the two split paths are undertaken. When presented with a choice to live with either parent upon their divorce, Addie searches both of the realities to find out what the best path will be. Both realities happen to be centered around a love interest, Duke, the popular quarterback and Trevor, the quiet artist. One occurs in the paranormal town where she lives, and the other in the norm world without powers and a new school. I enjoyed both of these perspectives, as they presented a fresh outlook on Addies life. The romance was fantastic  yay for no instalove! Kasie West takes it even further by not making either one of them as perfect, each with their real problems and issues. With both Duke and Trevor, Addie is realistic and from the get go she knows what she does and doesnt want in a guy. She treats the relationships with curiosity, getting to know the guy, and maturity, knowing when to pull back. I loved how she went through some realistic character development here and its not often YA relationships are treated this way. I loved Kasie Wests somewhat effortless, refreshing, easy to read writing. All of her characters seemed so real and relatable, especially Addison who is smart, caring and wants the best possible outcome for her parents and friends. It was refreshing to read a novel that wasnt bogged down in drama and angst, yet still present a realistic high school perspective with cliques, footballers and strict parents. Even though Pivot Point has some paranormal elements, it is mostly a contemporary with superpowers thrown in. If you look for explanations to why Addie and her town have these superpowers, youre going to end up disappointed. Instead of offering us direct parallels, things which Addie discovers in one reality, applies in the other. My heart broke for her as she goes through some pretty dramatic and traumatising experiences in each one, but in the end, she chooses the right path for everyone. Pivot Point was an engaging, refreshing take on the alternate realities formula and delivered an excellent exploration into two different realities. Kasie West seamlessly blends two different realities with paranormal elements. What starts off as a light contemporary, will morph into a mysterysuspense novel where Kasie is trying to solve various mysteries in each one  each with their different consequences. I recommend it to YA lovers of contemporary and paranormal and cant wait to read Split Second.
Seventeenyearold Ella Harper has not had an easy life. She started stripping at fifteen to pay her dying mothers medical bills and now she strips to keep a roof over her head while still attending high school. But everything changes when Callum Royal shows up at Ellas school and announces that since both of her parents are dead and as her fathers the man she never met best friend, he is her legal guardian. Ella tries to run but Callum quickly locates her in a strip club where shes trying to earn a little fast cash. He makes her an offer: come live with him and his five sons and hell give her 10,000 each month that she stays plus more after she graduates. Reluctantly Ella goes with him to his mansion on the Atlantic coast. Upon arrival it is clear that Callums sons are not happy that shes going to be living with them  Especially second oldest son, Reed. As Ella tries to settle into her surreal new life the Royal house is filled with tension as the boys try to prove Ella is either sleeping with their dad or just after money. Ella tentatively becomes friends with Callums girlfriend Brooke and Valerie, the cousin of her new schools resident mean girl, Jordan. The longer she stays the more the Royal boys realize shes not going anywhere and a truce is forged. The more time Ella spends with the gorgeous Reed, the more she wants him. But does he want her too? As they grow closer Ella finds herself falling for Reed. But what dark secrets is he hiding? Do they have a future or will Reed torpedo their budding relationship and break Ella in the process? Paper Princess was an amazing read! I found it nearly impossible to put down from the first page. Paper Princess reminded me slightly of a mashup between Megan Meads Guide to the McGowan Boys by Kate Brian and the movie Cruel Intentions. Ella is tough as nails on the outside but on the inside, she just wants normalcy and to be accepted. I loved all of the Royal boys, especially Easton. I wasnt sure I would like Reed but underneath his angry exterior is an amazing, caring guy. The ending completely shocked and broke me and I NEED to read the next book pronto! As a whole Paper Princess is a perfectly written tale of a poor girl with a dark past being thrust into a vastly different life than shes ever experienced before. This book made me laugh at times but more importantly it made me FEEL. I loved every minute of this fastpaced read and I cant wait to see whats next for Ella and the Royal family.
I felt myself getting more and more excited about this book as the release date drew closer. Ive enjoyed the Twilight books and Im looking forward to their conclusion in Breaking Dawn, but I found myself pretty intrigued to see what Stephenie Meyer would do when she set out to do something different. Plus, I was just in the mood for some science fiction. Ive loved sci fi ever since I picked up my first Ray Bradbury and, even though Meyer states its science fiction for people who dont read science fiction, it certainly qualifies. What with the aliens and all. And there ended up being more and a wider variety of them than I was expecting. Youre undoubtedly familiar with the premise of this novel already, so Ill leave it at this: its invasion of the body snatchers, but the body snatchers are benevolent and the humans are, well, human. Flawed, emotional, corruptible. You name it. And there are very few of them left at all. But the few there are are....tenacious. Especially Melanie, the human whose body has just been taken over by the soul called Wanderer. Known for her extreme skill at taking over a body, as well as her penchant for never staying on one world for more than one life, Wanderer has been handpicked for insertion in the rebellious Mel in the hopes that she will be able to glean details from Mels memory about possible leftover humans in hiding. As you might expect, all does not go smoothly for Wanderer. Or Mel. The great thing about The Host is that the main character is one of the bad guys. As a result, the readers emotions and loyalties are wonderfully conflicted throughout the beginning of the story. It doesnt take long, though, to fall in love with Wanderer and I really liked the way Meyer interspersed Wanderers narrative with flashbacks from Mels life as she hurled them, one after another, at Wanderers mind in a bid to save herself as well as the ones she lovesher younger brother Jamie and her human love Jared. I was pleasantly surprised to find that, contrary to the whole love story being central to the plot scenario Id been prepped for, the book was not at all ruled by romance. It is a story about love, but its more a story about what it means to be human and humane. The love in the story encompasses all forms: familial, friendship, platonic, and romantic. I was particularly drawn to Wandas fierce love for Mels little brother Jamie and the lengths she went to to protect him. The Host is in many ways despite its length a small, intensely personal story. I loved it, was sad when it was over, and will reread it again soon.
Four and a half stars for this one, it was fantastic! First of all, it was even better than Girl of Fire and Thorns, which I expected and thankfully wasnt disappointed! For one thing, I loved Lee. She was confident and brave and determined and just wow. And everyone else! It was fantastic with the other characters, how I actually had no liking or feeling for them at first but then over time I get to know them and grow to like them  this is so realistic. They became family :D They were like real people. They made me laugh and they made me angry. The reverend? rolls eyes It felt like making fun  I wonder if things really might have been like that at the time. I hope so, otherwise it was a bit... ridiculous. And yup, there were bad guys whom I just wanted to pound into the ground every now and then. I though there should be more of a showdown with Hiram though? Probably in the next books. And the romance was really unromantic cough I mean the two were best friends since children and for the most part had to act as if Lee was a boy. Which brings me to another thing. It was a girldisguisedasaboy story! I love these, thanks to Shakespeare who introduced me to such and made me like them. It didnt get Lee into as much trouble as I initially expected. It brought up some woman problems that gave trouble to her in her disguise  I dont think it was inappropriate rather perceptive actually but it might be awkward for younger readers specially boys. And it was historical fiction with a fantasy element  and it was amazing! I LOVE THE GOLD RUSH, OKAY? I am jealous I wasnt the first to get this fabulous idea. Lee divines gold! And the gold rushes of history really have a spell on me. It was very unique :D Also lots of intense dangers. Crazy stuff happens. Robbers, Indians, disease, buffalo stampedes, child birth, death, amputation and injuries, and so forth. I loved it! But there was A LOT of travelling. Literally the whole book. It wasnt boring, but some parts were not as interesting. Travelling is always one tricky thing for me. A little slow on occasion. And the themes of family and friends and finding good people in the world and those you can trust and the growth and Lees learning and journey and all that  awesome. This was a fabulous book and I cant wait to read the rest of the trilogy. Everyone who reads this, listen to me now: GO GET THIS BOOK RIGHT AWAY. P.S. Did I mention the title comes from the hymn Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing? That was so cool.
Holy crap, where do I begin? Ive been a fan of John Green for a while due to his posts on the Vlogbrothers and Crash Course Youtube channels. Hes really funny and I really appreciate his formation of the nerdfigher community. The movie Fault in Our Stars is coming out on June 6th and of course on all of the youtube channels John is working with there has been a big hype, so I decided to read the book for John. I was blown away. Im a pretty slow reader, yet I was able to finish this book in less than day, I was hooked. Even though this book is primarily geared toward young adults and primarily toward the female gender it provided insights that are extremely complex even in the adult world. The book is so much more than just depicting a relationship between two sick kids. The book goes into problems of death and oblivion, especially from a young teens perspective. What happens to those who care about us after we die and how do we affect them? Do we affect them for the better? Will they be able to continue on after our existence? Will I make a small or big contribution to those I love? How do we cope with the constant threat of death right at our doorstep? Yea, a lot of it is about pondering death. Whats a big tragedy is that it forces these teenage cancer patients to think these thoughts when in a perfect world these thoughts should be far away in the future. Johns writing style is hilarious and pretty insightful. The two main characters in the book are pretty smart teenagers yet they still get things mixed up such as metaphors and even scripture, and thats part of the point, they are still adolescences. It was kinda cool as I was going through Crash Course Literature on Youtube that is hosted by John Green around the same time I was reading this. John gives you into some insights into his favorite classics in the show and it is then reflected in the book. From works like Catcher in the Rye to SlaughterHouse Five. The biggest point he drives home with these novels in the book and the show is the mysteries of existence and oblivion which plague the two star crossed lovers. The book is full of metaphors, some hormonal teen drama, symbolism, and questions on existence itself. I appreciate that the book can mean so many different things to different readers. John, through a character in the book, is quoted to say that once the author writes the book it then belongs to the readers. I will not be seeing the movie due to the fact that I will probably be in tears by the first five minutes. The tear soaked pages of my book are good enough.
My Thoughts: Please be aware that Im going to fangirl over this book I moment I started listening to this book I was intrigued. I liked both the main characters, Sydney and Ridge, as well as the side characters like Warren. I have to say Hoover makes a cast of characters who all have very different personalities and they all stand out to you when you are listeningreading. I liked Sydney because she is going through so much in the beginning of this book, I feel most girls could connect with her because she has some rough patches and her heart is vulnerable. I feel readers can also connect with Ridge because he is such an amazing man. He is willing to do anything to help Sydney even though he barely knows her. He opens up his home to her and maybe even his heart! It is so hard to write this review because I know I wont do this book justice and because I cant give away all of the big plot turns and twists. I guess the thing I can say about this book is the fact that Hoover weaves a story that anyone could fall completely in love with. She writes amazing characters who just feel so real and not two dimensional. She infuses both Sydney and Ridge with compassion, love, care, devotion, emotion, and feeling. There is never a dull moment in this book even though almost the entire story takes place in Ridges apartment. You never feel like the book suffers from the story happening in one place. You just absorb all of the feelings of these two and trust me when I say your heart will break and knit back together to just break again before this book is done. There were moments where I just wanted to shake Ridge and say kiss the damn girl already. Moments where I would speak out in the car while listening and squeal in delight or horror. Trust me if I had been reading this book at home Im sure there would have been a few parts that would have made me bawl like a baby. This book will just make you feel more than anything else. I truly believe it is the mark of an amazing author when I feel so much in a book. The things she puts her characters through are hard and yet so true to real life. If you are looking for an author that makes her stories difficult, frustrating, yet loving and full of good and bad feelings, this is the book. I havent read anything else by this author but this book was beyond amazing, it is the best book I have read in years except maybe Unravel Me by Mafi. This book instantly goes to the top of my favorite book pile. I love it so much I bought the book in paperback so I can reread it instead of just listening to the story, even though that was beautiful as well. All I can say is read this book, listen to this book, reread this book because it will captivate you for years to come.
Beautiful, heartbreaking, shocking, and innocent. This book has been getting a lot of attention and praise in the Bookstagram community I swear its like an entirely different world in there and I can now see why. The book has a splash of everything you would want in a YAComing of Age story: innocence, love, family, greed, tragedy, heartbreak, truth, and of course lies. It takes the reader through a time of happiness and tragedy as the protagonist, Cadence, searches for the truth behind an accident that caused her to lose more than just her memories of what happened in Summer Fifteen. Cadence Sinclair Eastman, Mirren Sinclair Sheffield, Johnathan Sinclair Dennis, and friend Gatwick Matthew Patil are the Four Liars of Beechwood Island. Coming from a family of oldmoney and pride, the Four Liars and their families spend every summer on Harris Sinclairs privatelyowned retreat. However, during Summer Fifteen summer  current age of the Liars Cadence was found alone on the beach, halfnaked, and nearly underwater with a serious head injury that resulted in her losing her memory of what happened. For the next few years Cadence spends her time suffering from terrible migraines, taking painkillers, and no memory of most of Summer Fifteen. Now two years later, Cadence is finally returning to Beechwood after her accident to be reunited with her liars and to find out what really happened to her that summer. Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound, then from my ears, my mouth. It tasted like salt and failure. The bright red shame of being unloved soaked the grass in front of our house, the bricks of the path, the steps of the porch. My heart spasmed among the peonies like a trout. Mummy snapped. She said to get hold of myself. Be normal, now, she said. Right now, she said. We Were Liars has everything you could ask for in a YA story. The author shows innocence through the Four Liars as they grow up together every summer, and the loyalty they have for one another as they are thrust into the center of greed that surrounds the rest of their family members. The reader experiences love and heartbreak between Cadence and Gat, the obsession of money taking control of morals and values, and the truth and lies that shape and destroy the liars. The writing is beautiful and descriptive. I found myself completely submerged in understanding for Cadence when her father left, and how it must have felt to pretend that it didnt bother her. It is very hard to go into too much detail when reviewing this book, and I know how frustrating it is reading the reviews because they are so cryptic. If you love young adult books than you really cannot go wrong here. The author embodies the emotions and rational thinking of four teens as they grow, and the harsh realization of what really happened to Cadence. The characters in this story are both selfabsorbed and caring, brilliant and ignorant, and terrible and wonderful. Even if you dont live their lavish lifestyle, there is something in this story for everyone to relate to. This story will make you smile, and it will definitely pull on those little strings that are attached to your heart. Bottom Line: JUST READ IT
Seriously this author always has me tricked. She hooks me, she has me thinking the worst and then pulls a story line 180 on me and just wows me, totally wows me. I loved If I Stay, I thought it was beautiful. Where She Went just ripped open some old wounds and created some really gut wrenching moments. I truly loved this sequel, maybe even more than If I Stay. This novel was told at the point of view of Adam, not Mia. I probably loved this the most about this sequel, it was a continuation of If I Stay but it felt fresh and the different perspective really made this story line just AMAZE. I get it now. I have to make good on my promise. To let her go. To really let her go. To let us both go. This novel is just an epic story of heart breaking love, fate and the inevitable future. The emotional connection between Adam and Mia is explosive but this book really pulls at your heartstrings as you see how Adam is struggling with his past, his present and is unable to see his future where he could be happy. This character is suffering both depression and anxiety and you really believe his only cure could be Mia. I needed to hate someone and youre the one I love the most, so it fell on you. You can really feel, as the reader, the emotions and difficulties that the characters experience. The emotions really crawl up inside you and you just hope that everything turns out for the best. Throughout the book your follow Adam, who is a super rock star now, as he dwells on his past and circles the pit of despair. The plot starts to change when Adam bumps into Mia for one night and everything gets turned upside down. Both characters are fighting over their own demons and it is truly wonderful as you feel everything that they go through and conquer. I think this book provided me with closure that was needed after If I Stay. This author is brilliant and it was a genius move on her part to change the point of view to that of Adams for this book. If I Stay is a definite read before Where She Went, together these books are phenomenal. Hate me. Devastate me. Annihilate me. Recreate me. Recreate me. Wont you, wont you wont you recreate me.
This is the fourth and final book in the Lunar Chronicles. I adored this book, in fact I have pretty much loved this whole series. This book is just perfect and made me so sad that the series is over. Princess Winter is the somewhat disturbed stepdaughter of Queen Levana. She despises Queen Levana and is desperate to find a way to get the people of Lunar out from under Levanas rule. Winter is doing what she can to help; she saved Scarlets life and is trying to find ways to help Cinder claim the Lunar throne. Can Winter, Scarlet, Cress, and Cinder do what is needed to save both the people of Lunar and Earth from Levanas dastardly plans? This book switches point of view a lot and goes between a number of characters. We hear from Winter, Scarlet, Cinder, Cress, Levana, Jacin, Wolf, Thorne, and Kai. This works beautifully for this book. Each of these characters is incredibly interesting and fun to read about. Meyer blends all of these POVs together beautifully to make an engaging, cohesive, and epic story. The story is mainly science fiction with some romance. Meyer does an incredible job of blending fairy tale elements into this epic science fiction story. This book is of course kind of a retelling of Snow White. Meyer brings in elements of the evil stepmother, the dwarfs in the form of the miners who offer Winter assistance, and the poison apple. These elements are cleverly woven in and never feel forced or contrived. This is an excellent fairy tale retelling, but really it is much more than that. This is just an absolutely beautifully crafted story in general. This is one of those stories that has it all; excellent worldbuilding, engaging characters, action, interesting scifi elements, politics, intrigue, and romance. I have loved every book in this series but this book was the best by far. It was so much fun to see all the characters come together from the first three books and watch how everything is wrapped up. Meyer obviously had the story well planned out from the beginning and it was amazing to see how it all played out. Overall an incredibly conclusion to the Lunar Chronicles. So many things are done perfectly in this story; it was an excellent series in general. The story is very creative, fun to read, and engaging. This is a long book but I breezed through it in a couple days and it never felt long or slow. The characters, world, and plot were all amazing. This whole series is highly recommended to everyone; especially to those who enjoy creative fairy tale retellings and action packed science fiction.
Epic is a state of mind. Where Bright Side broke me into a million beautiful pieces, Gus put me back together. I didnt even realize I still needed that until after I finished. Bright Side was beautiful. It was an Epic story with an epic conclusion. Gus wasnt necessary for the plot, but it was for your soul. It was a gift. You were a gift. A gift that made my life worthwhile. A gift that made life fun. A gift that filled me with music. A gift that filled me with love. A gift that inspired me to live on the bright side. There were many tears involved with reading Gus, they were more controlled than with Bright Side. I cannot fathom the pain that Gus mustve felt when Kate was gone, however through Kim Holden I can get a glimpse of the pain one must feel in losing their best friend. Seth King wrote:  This world is hard enough for some people. But for those who are willing to take the journey, to cry and sweat and bleed beside a good character and then be put back together and be reminded, ultimately, of what makes us alive, Gus is the perfect book for you. He perfectly encompassed that of which is Gus. This book is like chicken soup for your soul, not the collected stories of strangers from all over the world, but the actual comfort food that you need. I think people find each other when theyre ready for them. When they need each other the most. And its in that time of need that the strongest relationships are formed. The same can be said about a reader and an author. You find an author when you need their stories the most. You find them when your soul is aching for a kindred spirit. Kim Holden is such a beautiful soul, too. You fell in love with the characters in Bright Side, Youve wondered about them since the end, now you get to be there as they heal. This is a tale of heartache, despair, rebirth, and finding love after all that life throws at you. You never know who will be your person in the end, this book proves that although it can be unpredictable life sure is grand. Thats the secret. You find what you love and you go for it. Life aint about coasting. Its about pushin the damn gas pedal all the way to the floor. Same goes for fun and love, no coasting. Pedal to the floor.
RATING:  4 whodoyoutrust stars REVIEW: Ok, it took me until just now to really take a look at the cover of this book. I mean, of course I noticed the lettering and the violin, but I didnt really notice the picture within. This book has been staring at me from my shelf for over a month and I just saw the dingy alley hiding under the design. Of course it wouldnt have made much since before I read the book, but now I need to take a moment and applaud the designer because the cover is absolutely fantastic. Now that that bit of a tangent has been taken and done with, lets move on to the book seriously, sometimes I wonder why people read my reviews, Im a rambling stream of consciousness! This was a solid 4 star book and an incredibly promising start to a new series. In a future world, but not exactly a postapocalyptic or dystopian one, monsters exist and the shadows have teeth. Mankinds evil is made manifest and life has become seriously creepy. I loved the idea behind this story, that human sin has become viciously tangible. And then Schwab takes it further and creates additional chaos and complications to thoroughly turn everything upside down, even in a world that was already upside down when we came into it. Our hero is August Flynn. Hes a bit odd and he doesnt get out much. I wont spoil it for you but lets just say that hes the awkward half of the story. And our heroine is Kate Harker. Shes not exactly likeable but thats why I loved her character. Too often fantasy novels give us a pretty but special girl who just needs the right environment to shine and be the hero. Not quite so with this book. Kate is a wee bit evil and selfish. She is trying so hard to do what she thinks she ought to do that she kind of screws it all up. And I LOVE this, it feels different and unexpected, a touch of the antihero and if youve read Schwabs book Vicious, you know she creates amazing antiheroes and Im not quite sure where Kates story is going to take us. Wonderful anticipation. Now on to the notsoperfect. The big reveals at the climax of the story were a bit predictable. However they were dispatched in the scope of this book so I have no idea what is to come and what the new obstacles are going to be in the next book. The obvious has been done away with and now its a wide open road ahead. Things you might want to know in advance: Monsters of many varieties, Weapons, War, Violence, Blood, Crime Syndicate...guys, its anime! No, seriously, thats what most of Schwabs books end up reminding me of, a heavy influence of anime feeling but slightly less cartoonish. Maybe that makes sense, maybe not, but its pretty much my wrap up. Guys, its the anime.
Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire, the spark that started a revolution, once again finds her life in chaos. Rescued from the Quarter Quell and whisked to District 13 and the seat of the rebel cause, Katniss is expected to take up her role as the figurehead of the rebellion; as the Mockingjay so ready and willing to fight the Capitol. Peeta is captured. Probably deadit would be best if he were dead. District 12 is gone. And Katniss finds she can no longer hide from the war she never meant to start. Many are willing, as ever, to tell Katniss what to do, who to support and what role to play. But before she can become the Mockingjay, before she can save Panem, her loved ones, or even herself, Katniss will have to decide what cost she is willing to pay for survival and, ultimately, for freedom in Mockingjay 2010 by Suzanne Collins. Mockingjay, the follow up to Collins insanely popular books The Hunger Games and Catching Fire hardly needs an introduction or help getting into the hands of eager readers. This book, like the rest of the trilogy, sells itself. In the much anticipated conclusion to the trilogy, Collins does little to disappoint. Filled with twists, action, and memorable characters, Mockingjay will keep readers guessing and riveted until the very end. And what a finish. In a lot of ways Mockingjay was even more brutal than the other books about Katniss and Panem because Collins made it so clear that these characters are damaged beyond repair. Will they keep going? Of course. Will anyone be the same after the war is decided once and for all? Of course not. The writing is scattered and often bleak, likely because our heroine is repeatedly injured mentally and physically. Collins is brutally honest about what it has cost Katniss and many of the other characters especially the other Victors of the Games to make it this far while showing irrevocably that war rarely solves anything neatly and often hurts the very people its trying to save. Still its impossible to turn away from this modern, original story of a girl, a revolution, and a war that is fought as much on camera as on the front lines. Mockingjay remains a strong, compelling story about characters that have captured the worlds imagination. Some reviews have suggested that the core characters were inconsistently written here or that the ending was lacking. On the contrary, Collins has not only been faithful to the spirit of the first two books but also created an utterly original conclusion to a powerful trilogy. I love all of the books as physical objects with the arresting designs by Elizabeth B. Parisi and cover art by Tim OBrien. I love the energy from this series. I love the characters and the story. I find myself completely moved and maybe even rattled by this powerful, surprising, and ultimately appropriate ending to a series that has quite literally changed the face of young adult literature forever. Possible Pairings: Green Angel by Alice Hoffman, How I Live Now by Meg Rosoff
Illuminae is the first book in the young adult series, The Illuminae Files 1 by author duo Amie Kaufman  Jay Kristoff. I think I am one of the last people in the world to finally jump on board and read Illuminae. Now that the paperback version of the book is coming out, and book 3 in the series is coming out later this year, I knew it was finally time to read book one. I have heard nothing but amazing things about the book, and I have heard the series being called different enough times, that I had to see for myself. And now I can confidently say...I am a huge Illuminae fan! This book is so awesome. I know it has been said a lot, but the format of this series is like nothing else I have ever read. I absolutely loved it. It has to be super difficult to write and put together because I could tell how complicated and detailed the world is. I mean the scope of this series is just huge. The Illuminae files are the story of our two main characters Ezra and Kady. At the start of the book, the two of them had just broken up, and then their planet gets destroyed and they are caught up in a whirlwind escape, and then the adventure is just starting for them. Illuminae took me a little bit of time to catch my bearings. It is very scifi so there are all kinds of foreign terms. Take that and add it to the fact that the book is not told in a traditional format. We are basically Erza and Kady, searching through things and reading redacted files, notes, clues and all kinds of things. It is so immersive and quite frankly, awesome. It is part novel, part be your own detective story. I completely love it. I became really, really absorbed in Illuminae. I was totally immersed in the world Jay and Amie created, and I was right along side the characters, overwhelmed, and confused at points and totally fascinated with the whole thing. Plus, the twists and turns are crazy! Crazy people! Bottom line: The Illuminae Files is a book that you really have to experience for yourself. Gosh, this book was an incredible experience. I dont remember anything like it. It really earns the title of unique and different. Not to mention, I am also loving the romance. More on this after I read the next book. I loved this book. It is always going to be a favorite of mine because I will never forget this book. Read Illuminae. Or reread it to get ready for book 3. But if you are new to the series, like I was, now is the perfect time to grab a copy and start reading.
This book was my most anticipated book of the year, and I am so happy to say that this book did not disappoint me at all. This book is the perfect example of how to end a series. I think Marissa Meyer deserves a round of applause for this book and this series. My favorite thing about this book and this series in general would be the characters. I loved each character. I have grown attached to every single character in this series. I have never cared so deeply for a cast of fictional characters before. As I stated, I loved the characters in this book. However, I loved the relationships between the characters even more. The friendships in this book were all wonderfully written and developed. The friendships in this book are the definition of squad goals. Even though I love the friendships, I am obsessed with the romantic relationships. Scarlet and Wolf had such a rough journey in this book, but they were always 100 dedicated to each other. Their romantic bond definitely seemed the most passionate of all the couples in this book. Cress and Thorne were adorable as always in this book. Their romantic moments were so precious and they made me squeal with joy. I think they are perfect for each other. Winter and Jacin had such a strong bond. I loved how they were always there for each other through thick and thin. Kai and Cinder were as awkward and adorable as ever in this book. I LOVED the way their romance wrapped up. I JUST LOVE ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS AND ROMANCES SO MUCH. This book was just simply brilliant. The book was fast paced and it constantly kept me on the edge of my seat. The writing in this book was amazing. The dialogue was believable and extremely charming, the world building was fantastic, and I never felt like the book was too long. I could have read 800 more pages of this book. My only complaint with this book was that I wish the main characters would have had more time together. They got split up a lot, and I just wanted them to be together as a squad a lot more. Overall, this was a fantastic book and a fantastic series. Words cannot explain how much I will miss this series. 5  5 Fangs MrsLeifs Two Fangs About It Facebook Twitter
Trigger Warning: Abuse, Kidnapping,  Self Harm I picked Half Bad up randomly when I went to the library. I had been hearing stuff for a while that this book was so good. Unfortunately, I cant say thats true. The beginning of the book starts off with the middle of the story, then backtracks to how his life was. There are skips and bounds because if we saw every little detail of Nathans life, thered be multiple books for sure. We see enough of Nathans life to know that his life was total shit. Abused for years by his older sister with her sick and twisted games, ostracized because of his heritage, and loved by only a few people, its safe to say that Nathans life is total shit. I found myself reading this book slower than I usually read books. I normally whizz through books when I put my mind to it, especially if I find a story interesting. And while I did find Half Bad to be a tad interesting, I didnt find that this book had the usual oomph to it. I mean, Ive read reviews where this book is praised like its the next god. I however, found Half Bad to be exactly that. Its not half bad, but its not half good, either. I found this book to be okay. The writing in this book is slow paced, and while yes, there are spaces in time in the story, I found the writing to be okay. Because of all the jumping in the story, I found the flow of the book to be extremely choppy. And at some points I even found the writing and story to be almost diarylike. Nathan will tell us what he did for the day, and then hell go to sleep. And then the next paragraph  the story will continue on with how the last week had gone by. What he did, who he saw, or what he was even thinking about. Compared to what people had said, and have been saying about Half Bad since its publication, I found Half Bad to fall so far below the expectations of what I had envisioned. I dont know is Ill be reading the second book, Half Wild, but if I do, Im going to keep my expectations low so I wont be disappointed. And truthfully, I dont even know how Half Bad fell through my expectations because I honestly went into this book not knowing what this book was about, or knowing what would happen. Maybe Half Bad is just one of the books that fell through my fingers.
ALRIGHT, lets talk about this book. This book that made me so incredibly happy, yet tore my heart out at the same damn time. As you all likely know, this is the final book in the Lunar Chronicles, and the fact that it was the last book was killing me the entire time I was reading it. I took my time with this book because I knew it was the end and I didnt want it to be. I read every other book in this series within 48 hours, and yes this one is 800 pages, but it took me a week and that is very very unlike me. Every time I sat down to read this, I only wanted to read 5075 pages before thinking ah its too much thats it for today!! All of that said, Im so glad I took my time through it. I feel like Im going to remember it much much better this way, and oh god was it ever incredible. I couldnt have asked for a better ending to this series, I couldnt have wanted better for any of our main characters which there are a lot of. Okay, except Wolf maybe, I feel bad for Wolf. This book made me feel things, like happy, sad and really really angry all at once, and it was like being on a roller coaster, but honestly I expected the ending to make me feel just a little bit more. Was the ending great? Yes. Im glad I didnt fall into a puddle of tears for the last ten pages of this book. There wasnt too much heartbreak other than knowing the story was ending. But for once after reading a series, Im not questioning anything about the ending. I feel like there are no loose ends. Everything, every single plot point from the past books was wrapped up in this if it wasnt wrapped up previously, which I really appreciate. Overall, I think this book was the best possible way for the series to end. The story was good. I didnt feel overpowered by all the action. I wasnt thinking ok yeah thats cool theyre shooting people but why??? everything came across very clearly, and I wasnt even mad at the length. At first glance it looks like this book is MAYBE 500 pages, but no, its 827, but the pages are super duper thin. Its misleading, but it made the book less daunting so??? Idk, anyways, this book was incredible, please read it, and if you havent read the Lunar Chronicles yet please please please get up right now and go to your local bookstore or library or go on amazon and get yourself the beginning of this series. You will not regret it or be the slightest bit disappointed. You will fall in love with every single character, you will fall in love with the world, you will fall in love with the writing. Its incredible. Please read it.
original short review written September 18th  edited and extended October 30th Much like Cinder, it took me a while to actually get into this book, and Im still not entirely sure why. Maybe its because Im only just getting into SciFi books? But I found that the story did pick up soon enough  maybe around 100 pages or so  and I was enjoying the story. I didnt think the plot was as predictable as the first one, which is a good thing. I remember thinking I knew what was going to happen, only to be surprised when the story took a different turn. The plot twists seemed more surprising in this book than the first, however I think the switch between character perspectives for the chapters could have been improved slightly, as some didnt hold any suspense. My favourite aspect of these books are the fairy tale retellings, as the story seems to reinvent the old fairy tales to create a fast paced futuristic story. I especially enjoyed seeing which parts of each fairy tale would be brought into the story in their own unique way. Marissa Meyers writing style was captivating. Instead of writing simple sentences to tell you what happened, she weaves this elaborate description of the events together to show you what happened. There were plenty of new characters involved in this story, as well as the characters from the first book. The main characters had strong personalities and enough will to keep the story going throughout. I was intrigued to see how the characters of Cinder and Scarlet linked together, and certainly didnt expect their stories to be woven together the way they were. The link between them was cleverly done, since it isnt direct but is instead subtle in a way that makes it seem like a secret. There were certain characters from the first book that Id have liked to read more of  Queen Levana for example. The story took an interesting turn, almost creating a bridge leading towards the 3rd book. The events became a little more complicated, because more problems were brought in, however it remained understandable. The switch between character perspectives for each chapter was easy to follow, as each character had a different and unique situation they had to deal with. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and liked the main character Scarlet more than I thought I would, purely for her determination throughout. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series! Rated 45 stars!
This quote from the blurb sums this book up perfectly... In love we find out who we want to be. In war we find out who we are. This book ripped out my heart... but it was totally worth it! A powerful and moving story of survival, love and never giving up. I will never forget this story. Yep... its gonna stick with me for a while. The aftermath of emotions I was experiencing when finished involved lots of hugging, a glass of wine and a sleepless night. What an ugly mark in our history books... if only we could make it go away... but, we cant... so we remember instead and learn. This book takes place in France during WWII when they were occupied by the Germans. The pain and suffering that Viann and Isabelle endured in order to survive was a difficult story to read. Viann, who was doing all she could to take care of her daughter while having to house a German soldier under her own roof, endured a life where hunger, poverty, loss and fear were now the standard. And then we have Isabelle, our Nightingale, a woman determined to fight and do whatever it took to help win the war and reclaim France. She was part of a rebellion that formed safe routes to help rescue fallen airmen and sneak them out of France. Not an easy task when betrayal was common and no one could be trusted. Desperation will make people do things they never thought they would do, even turning in a friend in exchange for money, food or protection. I usually avoid books that involve the German concentration camps because its too painful for me to read about that dark time in our History. And, I have never really taken the time to reflect on the amount of suffering France endured during this occupation. So much loss, pain and suffering... how does one pick up the pieces of their life after a war such as this?? This is a story that you need to be prepared to read... even though it is historical fiction, it is laced with truth which makes it a very painful journey. Im so glad I took the time to read it... This book was incredibly written... thought provoking...inspiring... but also devastating... and ends with this simple message... Wounds heal. Love Lasts. We remain. Thank you Kristin for this amazing story... you owe me a box of Kleenex! ARC was provided by St. Martins Press Follow us on KT Book Reviews Twitter Facebook Pinterest
Easy struck a chord with me; the depiction of college life felt authentic and brought back memories of dorm days and frat parties and mean rumors and heartbreak and The Games We Play. Of course theres a lot of texting too, which dont exist in my memories because I AM OLD. Pagers, anyone? Jacqueline, the girl formerly known as Jackie, has been dumped unceremoniously by her boyfriend, frat boy and future politician Kennedy. Honestly, Im surprised that she wasnt expecting it. He did, at one point say, Youre my Jackie. Its supposed to be this sweet sentiment like, Were meant to be. But what I saw was: Youre the wife that Im gonna step out on. Crushed, Jacqueline doesnt want to get out of bed, and she certainly doesnt want to go to Econ and sit next to her now EX Boyfriend. Fortunately for her, there is a guy with a lip ring, tattoos, and charcoal smudged fingertips staring at her from the back of the classroom just waiting to step in. Because when God closes a door he sometimes opens a window. So that hot guys can climb in and watch you sleep. I liked Jacqueline. Shes smart, shes kind and shes a bad ass who doesnt let herself get knocked around. Also? She plays the upright bass. Hell yeah. I didnt entirely hate Kennedy and I appreciated that he wasnt completely written off as scum. He lets his little head make important decisions which is dumb but also so like a guy, am I right? I felt like he truly cared for Jacqueline and it was nice to see a bit of his home life and his interactions with his siblings. Lucas, of the lip ring and tattoos and charcoal smudged fingertips, is just mysterious enough. Hes got a pretty heartbreaking backstory. Hes obviously into Jacqueline, but he still manages to give her mixed signals and act like he couldnt give a rip, which is also SO like a guy, am I right? In case you were wondering: LucasKennedy. Lucas is HAWT. Which brings me to one of my issues with the story: I felt that it was incredibly weird and lame that while Jacqueline is having a very serious conversation about rape with a group of girls, that as soon as Lucas name is mentioned he volunteers as a selfdefense assistant the girls get all silly and swoony and He is SO yummy. Which is SO like girls, am I right? But seriously, it completely threw off the tone of the moment. All in all, Easy was a sweet story about finding love and finding yourself. For me, Lucas is hot sauce because he helps make Jacqueline stronger, he encourages her independence and he makes an awesome sacrifice for her. I really did enjoy this book, and Ill probably reread it a million times.
First of all, if you are going to take this book seriously, put it down. NOW. Im not joking. This is a comical take on actual history that will definitely delight readers, but only if they dont take it seriously. It was magical. I loved the magical element that all three authors brought to the story. Instead of a war between the Catholics and Protestants that took place during the time period in the book, there is a brewing tension between Verities and Edians. The latter group has a magical ability to change into one animal form. The Verities think it is unnatural and they wish to exterminate the Edians by whatever means necessary. The fact that this was written by three authors worried me at first because how could three POVs and three writing styles work?! Everything flowed seamlessly and I never felt that there was a change in writing style. It all fit so well. Plot wise, there are three different stories woven into the book. King Edwards, Lord Giffords, and of course, Lady Jane Grey. I loved every POV because they were all so well written and characterized that I instantly liked them all. When I read a book and I dont like a main character, it can totally kill a book for me. I literally liked every character in this book, with the exception of the evil ones, but you will read about them when you read the story. At the beginning all three of our protagonists are very shallow. They experience so much throughout the book that they begin to grow and open up. Their character growth was very well done. My favorite parts of the book were the little commentary that the authors would throw in after something happened. It honestly made the book even more funny, if that was possible. With all of the creative liberties that our authors took, there are still historical details that are left in. We read about the rampant sexism and social issues that plagued this time period. Jane handled herself well. She was stubborn, strong, slightly too fearless, but every bit the heroine that I enjoy. Her and Gs relationship was very swoony. Prepare yourself, because underneath this hilarious story, there is plenty of court intrigue, magic, treachery, secrets, danger, and swoony romance! I dare you to try to read this almost 500 page book slowly, because I could not read it fast enough! Well done ladies! Originally posted at The Gilded Pages
I didnt have high hopes for this book after reading Delirium, but I wanted it to be better. I knew a couple people who had read the series in full and they all raved about it, and the idea behind it is a good one, like I said in my review of the original book. Sadly though, I liked this book even less. This book has two time lines: Then and Now. Then takes place right after Lena escapes from the city and makes it into the Wilds. It follows her through the first few months as she is getting used to this new lifestyle and a life without Alex. During this time, the Scavengers are making it harder for the good Invalids to live their lives. Now takes place 6 months later, when she is living in New York with 2 other Invalids, Raven and Tack. They are pretending to be a family who is proCure and proDFA Deliria Free America. Lena attends a rally for the DFA and is taken captive by Scavengers along with Julian Fineman, the son of the mayor. Through a course of events, the 2 escape capture and fall in love. They are eventually captured again, but Lena is taken captive by someone on the inside and makes it back to Raven and Tack. It is at this point that Lena learns that Raven and Tack were behind the abduction, that they paid off the Scavengers, who also work for the Zombies, it just depends on who is willing to pay more. This sends Lena into a tailspin. When Lena and Julian were taken captive the second time, Julian was given the option to be Cured or to be put to death, and Julian chose death. Lena decides to leave the group because she doesnt want to become Raven. Before Lena can leave for good though, she has to at least see Julian one more time, maybe save him. She finds where he is being held and is about to watch him die, when Raven breaks into the hospital room where he is being put down and kills Julians father. The three of them make a break for it and are now back in the Wilds. Julian asks Lena if she will ever leave him, she tells him of course, and then a mystery voice from behind says Dont believe her. Reenter Alex. Im only reading the last book in the series because its the last one and its short, and Im not a quitter this close to the end. But really, I wouldnt advise people to read it.
This book kept me genuinely interested. Albeit some minor character flaws, and mildly predictable occurrences. Welcome, welcome to Caraval! The grandest show on land or by sea. Inside youaEURtmll experience more wonders than most people see in a lifetime. You can sip magic from a cup and buy dreams in a bottle. But before you fully enter into our world, you must remember itaEURtms all a game. Nice way to begin, isnt it? This book was like those drinks where you sip fantasy and breathe imagination. This book had bits and pieces that resemble The Night Circus. It wasnt that the two books were similar, not really, but there was a connection like a world of magic, entertainment, and games that exists only within certain borders. I read the synopsis to caraval somewhere in 2015 way before its publication date. I know they say never judge a book by its cover, I guess if you count the synopsis being on the cover as being counted, then Im guilty as charged. But the idea was so intriguing, a place of magic and wonder and danger, where reality twists and turns, and even better, its been the dreamland of an isolated island girl who has never left home? How could you not want to read it?! The future knows what things we desire, unless there is something greater in our path that chases us away. I think I loved this quote so much I would have tattooed it on my heart, too bad Im middle eastern and dont have a death wish. The book was melodic and beautiful, it had a poetic rhythm to it once they entered the caraval. It was a gorgeous creation of fantasy and a wonderful setting, and oh how I loved Julian! Perhaps he was the best part of the book. She imagined loving him would feel like falling in love with darkness, frightening and consuming yet utterly beautiful when the stars came out. Oh yes, that is exactly how you could feel about Julian!!! Scarlett and Donatella had a beautiful sibling dynamic, the protectiveness they tend to develop when they are left to fend for themselves. Oh and who doesnt absolutely love the added touch of an abusively powerful father and absent mother. While this book had all the elements to create the perfect heroine, this is where it came up short. Between perfectly placed opportunities, scarlet could have been the ideal character, abused but strong, loving yet untrusting of the world, and ultimately surprising. But she just wasnt. I mean yes I did like her, but I could have loved her you see. Between being indecisive and uncertain, she seemed to keep emphasizing a very false sense of caution. I mean if you were so worried about your sister getting lost in the caraval, why whisp away time playing into their hands. I mean yes, if a person is only mildly concerned, they will fret and then go on about whatever they were doing, but when you suspect her life may be in danger, wouldnt you be tearing the world in two to find them? I think mainly Scarletts bravery seemed slightly more exaggerated than the reality of her actions. She wasnt the heroine I usually adore, but I did like her very much though. Overall the book was enchanting to say the least, dont let negative reviews keep you from tasting its magic!
MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS This was so awesomesauce!!! Dawson and Beth are such darlings. You couldnt not love them both the moment they were introduced. Shadows was really sugary sweet and poignant as fans of the fist novel, Obsidian, already knows what will happen to our sweet couple. Dawson was the complete opposite of Daemon. Dawson was like sunshine, unicorns and rainbows while Daemon was all thunder and lightning. Shadows gave an insight of why Daemon was the way he is in Obsidian. Even in Shadows, Daemon kept people at arms length and was the parent figure in the family as he was the oldest  by a few minutes. I understood Daemon better and his behavior in Obsidian was justifiable as it was like history repeating itself all over again. Dawson on the other hand, was a sweetheart and did what he liked. His romance with Beth was very different from that of Daemon and Katy. Dawson was the allsmilingandgrinning guy. He was very lovable and sweet. When he asked Beth for permission to kiss her, I found it so cute. I mean, how many guys nowadays actually asked your permission to do that? He did not regret loving Beth but the only thing he regretted was that he wasnt as strong as his brother. The other characters like Dee, Ash, Adam and Andrew were the same. Dee was as hyper as ever and her mouth was bionic as quoted by Dawson. Man, she could really talk your pants off and you cant help but adore cute Dee. The ending was really a heartbreak but I have a really strong feeling that Dawson and Beth may not be dead after all as Daemon and Dee never got to see their bodies. Therefore, I wasnt that devastated and frozen over the ending like my book buddy Maria Mentzelidi was. Shadows answered the questions I had in Obsidian but left me with even more after it. For example, what was happening to Beth when she suddenly felt all hot and collapsed near the end? After reading the synopsis of Onyx, Im more certain that this lovable couple isnt dead and Im really hoping that Im not wrong. They are too wonderful characters to be left dead. Jennifer, you cant just kill them off like that. Seriously. Shadows is a wonderful read and I recommend reading it after Obsidian. Now, Im simply dying for Onyx.....
Dark Notes was gifted to me in an ARC in exchanged for an honest review. I am giving Pam Godwin book 5 stars because this book was just so amazing. I can honestly say I have never read a book like this. I mean the intensity that this Author created within this story was just radiant, and the way she formed these two different characters was fascinating because even though it appears to us the readers that they are so different in so many ways they really arent. I mean yes they both grow up incompletely two different worlds. For example Ivory was raised in a bad neighborhood, and in an abuse home with a mother and brother who couldnt care less whether she lived or died. They both seen Ivory as the reason why they lived in such a hellhole. So all she wants to do is better her life and have a career in what she loves most and that is playing the piano. But it seems like everyone around her just wants her to fail. Its really sad because this poor girl has been through so much and all she wants is a break. Whats more sad is that she has no one to protect her from all of the men in her life that just want to use and hurt her. Well this is until Emeric her new teacher comes into her life. Yes he comes from a very privileged who was raised in a loving home as an only child. But of course with that power comes certain cravings that only Ivory can help settled them. I mean yes he can have any woman give him what he wants but they can never satisfy him like her. Of course he knows its wrong and he can get in so much trouble but he just cant help himself when it comes to her. This story was so touching and beautiful in so many ways. I mean dont get me wrong there was so many times when it made me so mad, but in the end I loved this book. If you have not read this book you should check it out. Theres so much more that happens in this book that I would love to share, but I dont want to spoil it for you. Your just going to have to read it to find out what happens to Ivory and Emeric for yourself.
4 stars Shadow and Bone... what took me so long? Considering how much I love a good fantasy, its kind of embarrassing how long it took me to get around to this one. This was not just a good fantasy  it was a great one. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The blurb on the cover by Veronica Roth reads, Unlike anything Ive ever read. I feel I have to agree with her. I like Shadow and Bone for being so different. A Russianesque fantasy setting? Never seen that before. While the Russian words got a bit confusing at times, it was a truly unique setting. Leigh Bardugo brought it to life, and it felt very real. The world building made the setting even more beautiful. I love Leighs concept of magic, its integration in the military and rankings, the perception of the government and class system. You discover the world so gradually, and Leigh definitely employs Show, dont tell thank you!!!!  the world is completely immersing. I suppose the romance in Shadow and Bone qualifies as a love triangle. And this is yet another one of those rare times where I strangely really like it. So theres Mal, the childhood best friend, who makes Alina feel comfortable and at home... and theres the Darkling. While Mal and Alina are adorable, Im so intrigued by the dark and mysterious Darkling. Theres gotta be more there. I just want more of him. He may be the most intriguing character of all, and considering his role in the book, thats a great sign for the series for me. The plot was irresistible. It was packed with action and intrigue while still creating this beautiful fantasy world. Plot twists amazed me and kept me reading feverishly with the desire to know more, right up until the last page. The ending just made me all kinds of excited. It was not a cliffhanger ending. Things were relatively nicely tied up. BUT. So much potential for the sequel and the series that all I can think is, I want Siege and Storm in my hands right now. Its definitely been a while since I finished the first installment of a series and thought of all the different paths the story could take and been so excited about it. So much potential. Definitely worth mentioning. Things that were less awesome: I hated how every girl in the book was portrayed as a backstabbing, jealous bitch, with, I suppose, the exception of Alina and maybe?? Genya. Across the board, the characters lacked a bit of depth. Summing Up: When youre looking for a good fantasy, definitely consider Shadow and Bone. It features an intriguing and immersing plot in a beautiful world, and the romance and plot twists will definitely evoke some feels. I have no regrets reading this and just want the sequel ASAP. In Three Words: Recommended To: Fans of awesome fantasy like Stormdancer and Finnikin of the Rock.
Last fall this book got a lot of buzz. The glowing reviews poured in, but I was unconvinced. Dead House came out at about the same time and disappointed me so I wasnt ready to try another unconventional novel. Recently though my interested was peaked when one of my favorite booktubers Elizabeth from Books and Piece raved about this story in one of her wrap ups. First of all the premise is much more complex than any description I heard last fall led me to believe. Originally I thought this book was about two teens on a spaceship who were running from an invasion while trying not to kill each other over their breakup. As you can tell from the description above this scifi thriller is actually about a malfunctioning ship computer, viruses and teen hackers. It is not the typical YA book and it was a ton of fun to read! Once I started reading I was hooked. The pace of this story is like a snowball rolling down hill. As I was reading the story the pace increased until I felt glued to the page and the story was on the edge of being out of control. Throughout the book the authors described the effects of stress and fear on all the characters really well. From the captains of the ships down the main characters, everyone reacted differently and struggled to remain in control in the face of danger and loss. It was chilling to read some of the accounts in this dossier not only of the human characters but the computer as well. I had goosebumps many times. While I was absorbed in the story itself, the format was a little hit and miss for me. A majority of the time it actually sped up my reading and helped me stay engaged in the story. There were a few points though when the textgraphics slowed me down and forced me to disengage with the story to read the spirals of text. Overall, the format connected me emotionally to the story more than many traditional novels have and I think it was effective. I have heard amazing things about the ebook as well and would like to check it our for a reread. Amazing book overall and I cannot recommend this first book enough. Im excited to continue on with this series as soon as possible.
Mia Sheridan is one of my favorite writers and Archers Voice from my point of view is her best book. The story is addictive and very soon you will be part of it with all your heart. Bree Prescott wants a new start in life and although many will find it weird, she chooses a secluded lakeside town to begin her new journey. Everyone seems very nice and things are finally making sense for her: peace, time for herself and for the things she loves and trying to keep out the memories that harmed her. Everything is about to change when she meets Archer Hale, a strange boy that manages to catch her attention. He is very complex in so many ways: beautiful on the outside but damaged on the inside. Soon Bree takes on the mission to get to know Archer because in a way she relates to him: they have the same hurt, they both went through a lot in life. The thing that makes Arches special is that he cant talk and can only communicate with her by the sign language. This is an unique element in the book, I have never read anything like this before. The two form a strong bond that will soon become love. Their relationship is very special at the beginning exploring each other and their new feelings and by the end they are inseparable. You come to see that two apparently different people discover that they have so many thing in common, they cant live without each other. The scenes between them were amazing, full of tenderness, passion, joy, sometimes anger and angst, but they connected so well you could feel their genuine love. Thanks to the amazing writing style we can get to know Archer and Bree better, to live with them the present events and also the past one, to see exactly what made them the people they are today. For me is important to get to explore a character past and present, to have all side of his story in order to make an opinion about him. In this way the reader can choose to empathize and live the story as strongly as possible without feeling excluded or kept in the dark about certain elements. This is the thing that I love about Mias book: total knowledge of her characters and in this way all that you are reading makes sense, because you get recollection of everything that happens throughout the story. In this book Mia presents an issue that can be debatable in real life: people with disabilities are often judged and secluded from the rest of the word because of this issues. Bree was the one who accepted Archer and loved him with all the pros and cons. It is a very important lesson to learn and keep in mind that the beauty of a person is his heart, not his exterior. Beauty fades in time, but the feeling remain as strong as possible. Mia thought us how to love people by what they offer us and what can we learn from them, not by the beauty of their face and body. A great book with a strong message. 5 stars for it!!! For more reviews please check 
This was a really difficult book to rate for me. Im still not sure this is the right rating, but I did enjoy the book. First, I loved Vampire Academy the whole series, so when I started reading this I definitely noticed all the similarities between these 2 books. Let me start with a short recap of the story. We meet Alexandria Alex, who has been living out of the Covenant for a couple of years now, since her mother abrubtly fled from there. Then one day, her mother is brutally attacked by a group of Daimons. Daimons are evil creatures that live off draining halfbloods and purebloods. The pure bloods have been known to be the only one that can be changed into Daimons. Alex manages to escape that night, but we get into the story when Alex is under a new attack, this time Alex is saved by some sentinels, within that group is Aiden a pureblood sentinel. They take her back to the Covenant, where shes close to be thrown into being a servant in stead of the Sentinel shes always wanted to become. Luckily Aiden and a few other pure blood sentinels speaks her case, and Aiden offer to train her so she can get back on track over the summer. While theyre training and getting to know one another a love for each other is slowly blooming, but they cant do anything about it, as love between a half and a pureblood is forbidden. After a while Alex discovers that her mother didnt die that fateful night, but was turned into a Daimon, so Alex is determined to kill her mother. She also meets Seth an Apollyon, a halfblood that has control of all elements, and find that shes not so ordinary herself. With all the similarities, especially in the beginning, I had so much trouble not thinking about Vampire Academy. I do however see where these two stories are different, and I did enjoy the story. I also think that I like Alex better than Rose as a main character. I liked that there wasnt a Lissa in this book. I really never liked her in Vampire Academy. I liked Alex friendship with Caleb. He was a great friend. Seth the Apollyon got on my nerves a lot, but I am intrigued to know what will happen in the next books with his and Alex connection. Aiden was cool and cute, and a great guy. I hope for Alex sake that everything will work out for them in the coming books.
When I got this book, I was incredibly excited to be a reading it, and b reading it before its released. Upon reaching halfway through the book, it occurred to me that I now have to wait what will probably be over a year to read the next book in this series. This year is going to be incredibly long year, and Im already feeling impatient. This book, was amazing. I tried to think of a better word to describe it, but I feel that no word would do it justice. I could not put it down, and literally carried it with me everywhere I went. I just hope there is another advanced reader contest and I get picked and that it magically happens sooner so I can read the next book! The plot line is enticing and original  despite the amount of dystopia novels that are coming out now for young adults, this was one I was not expecting. It is like a cross between the book Matched and the Hunger Games, airing a little closer to the side of Matched but with an action twist. The story keeps you guessing but still has clues throughout to help you find your way to the end, unless you are like me who was so excited to be reading it that I didnt stop enough to have time to piece the clues together before I read the end. This is the kind of book that, although it is a word that really I shouldnt want to live in, I do. If not for the story, than for the characters. The characters  all I can say is Im in love. The characters have a certain amount of depth Four and Beatrice in particular that isnt always found in young adult fiction, which I hope will be carried out in the next two books for the characters we havent heard about. Most importantly, I liked the main character, Beatrice. Typically when I read young adult fiction, I find the lead female character rather annoying, and I tend to think she made bad choices. In this book, not once did I slam close the book and think Why did the author maker her like this? Instead,in Divergent I was consciously aware how much I liked her, and how happy I was to finally have a strong female character who drove the book and didnt drive me crazy at the same time. All I can say is this is a mustread for any young adult fiction fans or fans of dystopia books. Really its a must read for anyone who can read, but we need to start somewhere! Enjoy! I received this book free through a Goodreads Giveaway.
Please note that while I have tried to avoid mentioning any spoilers, it was pretty hard to write this review without referring to anything specific, so I cannot guarantee that you wont read anything you didnt want to know! I first heard about Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children last year and made a post about it, sharing the super creepy movielike book trailer and extract, but for no good reason it at all, it has taken me a year to pick it up. I, like most people, was instantly drawn to it because of the cover and old photographs that are scattered throughout the book. I didnt realise at the time that these are vintage photographs  actually real and taken from personal collections  rather than created especially for the book. This is just one aspect of Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children that adds exciting realism to the story. Jacobs grandfather, Abraham Portman, escaped the Nazis during WWII, though his family were not as fortunate, but there are other monsters that continue to haunt him. In contrast, Jacob has spent most of his ordinary life listening to his grandfathers fairy tales of mysterious children who can levitate, become invisible, and play host to a swarm of bees. Jacob is about to experience just how extraordinary his life could be... Ransom Riggs expertly crafts eerie anticipation and buildup throughout the story. It is slow, but doesnt at all drag. Cairnholm reminded me a little of Shutter Island and thats how I pictured it  perfectly average, in a way, but tinged with a sense of something not quite right. Although you might first assume that Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children is a horror novel, it is neither horror nor a thriller, but instead a spectacular, bizarre mystery. A highlight of the novel for me was watching everything unravel and become clear to Jacob as well as myself. Who is Miss Peregrine? What happened to the orphanage? What part does Abe play? Halfway through the story, these questions begin to be answered, and it takes us to a world of fantasy and folklore involving the peculiars. Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children is a wonderfully cinematic story and I could easily visualise every odd conversation, every magical curiosity, every discovery, leading up to the big event at the end of the book. The magical elements were gripping, even though it is not my first choice of genre, because it constantly blurred the boundaries between fantasy and reality, which made me go with the story and believe it could be true. I thought that every single character stood out in particular Emma and Millard! although I wish we could have found out more about their individual histories perhaps in the sequel, published next year?. I also think it wouldve been interesting and possibly creepier if the children acted more as adults, because, after all, some of them are over one hundred years old. But, then again, they are not exactly normal human beings. Even so, I thought everything  the pacing, the little dropped hints, the strange events, and Jacobs narrative, worked together extremely well to create a fascinating and enjoyable plot. Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children is a wonderfully unique and inventive book with colourful characters, a mysterious story, and a splash of historical relevance, incorporating vintage photographs that bring the story to life. I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books.
Review I fell in love with Taylor Jenkins Reids book when I was granted a copy of Maybe in Another Life as one of my first ARCs ever. I read it in a day and it was my favorite book of the year. I have read two more of her books since and loved both. I am holding onto one because I need to know there is one left when I need a TJR book in my life. I was so excited for her latest book before I even knew what it was about because well it was written by her. Well, this one was definitely a bit different but it was still just as amazing as her other books. While The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was a departure from her other books it still had her signature easy readability to it along with a focus on relationships. The differences were more in how this looked at the whole life of Evelyn and spanned several decades. I loved looking at how different the world was as Evelyns story moved along. It was really interesting to see also how she changed along with the times. There was also a dual story going on  one was clearly Evelyns life story but the other was relating to the person she picked to help tell her story, Monique Grant, a journalist. We get a bit of Moniques life and story throughout as well as eventually finding out how and why Evelyn chose her. I found the whole premise fascinating and was so pulled into Evelyns story. It read almost like a memoir, as essentially that it what it was since it is Evelyn telling her story to Monique. As a memoir junkie I loved that and it really had my attention. While some things seemed so big Hollywood of the story it all felt like it could have been a real story. Like Evelyn Hugo really existed and I think that is why this book worked amazingly. Evelyn was such a complicated character. While I was often rooting for her, she was kind of an awful person when it came down to it. She was ruthless but in that industry at that time being a woman, you probably had to be. Complicated characters are great because they challenge you and make you think and Evelyn definitely did that for me. I wish Monique had a little more to her story though. I found her far less interesting in comparison. I did love her character growth throughout though. I thought this would be a lot more gushy than it turned out to be but make no mistake I loved this book. It was different and engrossing and just plain addicting for me. Taylor Jenkins Reid remains one of my favorite authors and look forward to whatever she puts out next.This review was originally posted on Rebel Mommy Book Blog
About a year ago I bought a copy of this book, right after it came out. Numerous times I picked it up and sat down to read it but never even cracked the spine. Perhaps something came up at the time or whatever the case may be, but I know now that I just wasnt ready for this story. Life is funny that way, and as I say that it makes me think of Augustus and his insanely brilliant way with words, even though he didnt fancy himself a writer. I truly beg to differ, however. If I could rate this with an infinite number of stars I would, in fact, let me do just that. This novel was so real that I felt as if I had read it before, and that doesnt mean it was like anything else I have ever read. No, it means that these characters were so real to me that my mind just could not comprehend that it was fiction. I smiled a lot, in the beginning and pretty much up until the point where Augustus had a hard time opening the elevator doors while in the hotel in Amsterdam. At that moment I burst out in hysterical sobs because I knew. We all did, I am sure, but poor Hazel didnt yet. My heart broke for Isaac when he lost his eyes and his bitch of a girlfriend, my heart broke for Hazel every second she had to suffer through labored breaths and the weary eyes upon her from strangers, but most of all, my heart broke for Augustus. This perfect guy who everybody loves but nobody really knows. Well, nobody aside from his parents, Isaac, and Hazel, that is. He was charming and funny and I fell in love with him from the moment he stared so intensely at Hazel across the room of the support group. The characters in this book made me so unbelievably happy to have known them and so unbelievably sad to say goodbye to them all at the same time. From the moment I began crying I did not stop until long after I had finished the book...and when I say cry, I mean the ugly crying that no one wants to see but that inspires great writing like this. John Green is a genius. He has broken my heart like no other before him and yet I look forward to him breaking it again and again in the future. If you havent read this book, youre either not ready for it yet or youre an idiot, so do yourself a favor and go dive into it as soon as possible. I finally see what all the reviews were about and I am so grateful for brave writers. A guy who takes a subject like cancer and smacks it in the face with witty characters who refuse to be a walking pity sign. Bravo Mr. Green! Bravo!
As seen on The Quiet Concert Is it a surprise to anyone that I loved this book? A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had became a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse  this cast of characters is like my dream come true. And a plot involving an impossible heist with lots of deception, trickery and powerplays in a world that Ive already fallen in love with couldnt be more perfect. I devoured this book and I cannot wait for me. Leigh Bardugos execution of this story was pretty flawless. We learn more and more about these characters and their pasts  explaining who they are and why  with each turn of the page. New layers to the heist unfold with each new chapter read. It was like peeling an onion and and with each layer I became more and more invested, more and more enraptured. By the end of the story I didnt want to say goodbye. I loved how different these characters were but how perfectly they fit together. I loved watching the dynamics within the group evolve and deepen. I loved the strength of the female characters in this story who are beyond inspirational. I loved how Kaz Breaker was always one step ahead. And I loved how, despite their occupation which breeds distrust, they had become a little family and cared for one another. They were fearless, daring, and compassionate when it came to protecting their own but dangerous, merciless and calculating to those who dare cross them. It was the perfect combination. And I rooted for them every step of the way. I loved the exploration into the other lands in the Grishaverse. I loved that the plot centered around enhancing Grisha power. I loved every time Nikolais name was mentioned in passing maybe this was just me. For fans of the Grisha trilogy, it was just the right taste of a world we knew while being something entirely new and exciting. You do not need to read the Grisha trilogy to enjoy this book. Everything about this book just worked for me. It was adventurous and unpredictable and so, so easy to love. This book was completely satisfying and yet that ending left me thirsting for more. I cant wait to go on another adventure with this gang and to watch them beat the odds again. Book twos release honestly cant come soon enough.
The premise of this story is that we get informed, in a series of case files, the events that led to the United States finding a giant alien robot which had been buried underneath the earth thousands upon thousands of years ago. They put the robot together and thus begins political pandemonium as you can imagine seeing as humans see anything as a weapon. I had previously read dossierstyle books before  they seem to be the letter writing style of the late 1800s The Time Machine, Dracula, etc as many authors today choose to do their books as such however despite some succeeding Illuminae is a great example, Sleeping Giants missed the mark by a mile. This book is a quick read as it feels like youre reading a movie script, if youve ever read a script or a play you understand the general gist. We are presented with a series of interviews done by an unnamed man who seems to be the puppet master of the rest of the group. The main issue that I had with this book was the utter lack of the human element. The point of a book is usually a connection between the reader and the writer; the writer attempts to make the reader feel something and the reader accepts this and internalizes it. However this book was so disconnected, the format made it even worse given that the characters were so stereotypical and lacking in dimension. The bad people were all bad, the clever people were always clever and you do not get to understand the why behind the decisions. There needs to be a balance between characters and plot and here the scale tipped drastically. So we follow 2 pilots of the giant statueweapon and these characters were absolutely painful to read. The plot of this book is ridiculous, which is fine, this is scifi, plots are meant to be ridiculous but it was all plot, plot, plot, the entire time and the human element was not woven throughout the novel which left the reader alienated. I cannot tell you how incredibly let down I felt, the disappointment was palpable because the premise held such promise and I was so excited to read this. I believe this is a debut novel so I can see how Mr. Neuvel will grow, he knows how to do plots, he just needs to learn to bring the reader to his characters. I also think this format does him no favors; this is truly better suited for a big blockbuster script than a piece of literature.
12 Illuminae is the first installment in coauthors: Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoffs young adult, science fiction series titled The Illuminae Files. Ever since reading the Starbound series, Ive been following Ms. Kaufman and this novel has been on my TBR since it was first announced. I have to admit Ive never read Mr. Kristoff before but based on my enjoyment of the writing in this book, Ill be adding some of his titles very soon! Illuminae was a wild ride with a good amount of twists and turns. The suspense was high and got stronger as the book progressed until it had me completely crazy by the end. The tone of this story is dark but I loved it. It is told through a variety of methods and perspectives and as every event comes to pass, the pending doom gets more and more palpable. But the characters bring a lot of humor as they cope with the devastation and even during the darkest moments, I found my mood lighten soon afterwards. My only reservation keeping my rating from a full 5 stars was the ending. I know that was probably everyones favorite part but I didnt need for everything to work out at the end. I was expecting for total death and destruction with a fade to black and I think a dark ending like that would have been consistent with the horror in this novel. I know that sounds ridiculous but not every story has to have a happy ending. I guess I had a bit of whiplash when suddenly the story continued after I thought it was over. A few days from now, I will probably smile and regret writing this bit, but today, directly after finishing the novel, thats how I feel . The Illuminae Files is another series I plan to loyally follow. It was fastpaced and I felt incredibly engaged throughout. I experienced Illuminae via audiobook and it was welldone. As noted in the synopsis, the story is told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documentsincluding emails, schematics, military files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more and although youd think it would be incredibly dull or confusing via audio, it wasnt. Each methodperspective is narrated by a different voice which was incredibly helpful in keeping track and providing some quality entertainment. Based on a friends review located HERE, the paperebook version offers the reader visuals which you obviously dont experience via audio so take all these factors into consideration before deciding how you want to experience Illuminae. Either way, youre a winner. Your brain and emotions will explode with the adrenaline rush that comes along with an engaging new read. Enjoy! My favorite quote: The universe owes you nothing. It has already given you everything, after all. It was here long before you, and it will go on long after you. The only way it will remember you is to do something worth remembrance. If interested, you can read an interview with the authors HERE.
Devastatingly Beautiful, a favorite of the year! Sometimes submission meant releasing pride, letting someone else take the reins, trusting someone with your love and your life, even though they didnt deserve it. I can tell you one thing for certain, I have never read a book like The Song of David before! It is a beautiful love story which will have you on the edge of your seat turning each page as you follow their story. Without giving spoilers, I will say that this story is a love story told via a series of audio tapes. Essentially, it is an audiobook within the pages of a book. It is stunning. It is passionate. It is gripping. The switch between then and now was seamless and at times heartwrenching. It is also a love story between three people; Millie, Henry and Tag. Hes special, Tag and he makes me feel special. I can feel it in my chest, the way I cant ever really catch my breath when hes around. I feel it in my stomach too, the way it flips when he says my name. And mostly, I feel it when he talks to Henry. Hes gentle. And hes sweet. But really, I am without words to describe the beauty of this book. It is a love story within a love story, a book within a book... an emotional rollercoaster ride, that I gladly took. I bawled ugly tears and happy tears, I laughed too. Amy Harmon was a puppet master and my heart and emotions were her toys. She played with them at will and I let her. I felt my heart squeeze both from joy and from heart ache. As soon as I was up, she had me free falling. One moment I would be enjoying the slow build romance and the incredibly endearing way Tag was with Millie, the next, I was bawling because of their love for one another. One moment I was laughing with Henry, the next he had me bawling because of the way he understood the world. GAH, I was a wreck. My husband and son were concerned! So who takes care of Millie? I whispered. I dont need to be taken care of, Tag, I whispered back. Ive been trying to tell you that. Need and want are two different things. I swallowed once, trying to convince myself that I didnt want what I wanted very, very much. I have to be completely honest here. When I began reading this, while I loved Amy Harmons writing, I was having a difficult time connecting with the story. The melancholy feeling was a little too much for my already melancholy mood. I started reading this as I was on the very long drive taking my daughter to her college orientation. So my mind wasnt in the right place. Gratefully, I took a break that night and the next day and didnt resume reading until the drive back home that next night. I am so glad I took that break. I think sometimes it is as much about the book that we read as it is about our mindset when we read it . Had my mind not been in the right place, I would have missed out on all the beauty and the incredible story that Amy Harmon crafted. This book had it all for me; it made me THINK and FEEL! I loved it! ARC graciously provided in exchange for honest review
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child They were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what  those flaws almost made them greater. In a nutshell... The Cursed Child is the 8th Harry Potter book and is the written script of the stage show centered on the epilogue of The Deathly Hallows. This book follows both the old favourites of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, whilst also introducing, Rose Weasley, Scorpious Malfoy, and Albus Potter. I really dont know how to feel over this one. It was so nice to have a new region of the Harry Potter universe to sink into and enjoy once again but I cant help but feel this book was missing a large part of its magic sparkle. It feels to me that this is a very good excuse to create what is probably a fantastic play with lots of references to the best parts of the series but this book on its own without the life of the performance was more of a highlights reel than a continuation of the story. There were many moments in this book which do not make narrative sense in the wider context of the Harry Potter universe and that is one thing I cannot forgive in this book. I am a mega fan when it comes to Harry Potter and to read a book marketed as the 8th part of the series and have certain details altered is unforgivable to me. There were many opportunities to make this a good story but instead the characters feel like ghosts of their former selves and do not have any emotional context which impacts on the reader. A lot of the story was ridiculous and reminiscent more of a bad Dr Who episode than a book with even a fraction of the character depth of Harry Potter. The characters used in this book should have been a gold mine of opportunity and instead they were squandered to such an extent that I dont want to could this book as anything but fanfiction. I hope to see this on the stage as I feel this is the true medium on which this story should be performed and judging from the stage directions it must be breath taking to see live but it is very underwhelming as a book. Too many side characters were pointedly ignored, very little of the events of the final book were referenced and certain characters were given offspring which REALLY REALLY should not have been allowed to happen. I would rate this as As much as this book disappointed, I cannot hate it. There is a certain magic in the world which can only be found when holding a new harry potter book, and I am glad to have experienced that in part again. I am this frustrated as I am so loyal to the series and this is the first time JK has let me down with her pure ability in story telling. More Book Reviews My Goodreads
Ive been told to read this for so long and thank the Oreo Gods that I finally read it! My husband actually read it ahead of me and liked to tease me as I gasped and reacted to various scenes throughout the book. I loved all of the nerdy references that Becky Albertalli weaved into her story. They didnt feel superfluous, which can be such a pain in the rear. If theyre shoehorned in, then if feels like Im being patronized and I hate that. The cast of characters were wide and varied. Some I loved and some I wanted to flick off the page like a stray piece of confetti. Martin wasnt exactly a villain, but I certainly disliked him a whole lot, especially with the crap that he pulled. The obvious thing is the blackmail that is alluded to in the summary, but theres more and I tell you, I wanted to throttle this kid. I dont know that I ever really understood him. He was blackmailing Simon for a date with some girl he barely knew. What has to be wrong with you to make you think that blackmailing someone is the answer to anything? Plus he got overly defensive at one point in the book even when the girl he supposedly had a crush on told him that it was alright. He seemed to be the type of kid that has a white knight image of himself, but that image never holds up as he well finds out. Alice, Simons older sister, was a great girl, but her story line was minimal and felt forced, like we were supposed to think there was something more to it than there ended up being. Ill admit that I was trying to guess Blues identity for a good portion of the book because why not? There were some false leads but by golly I did it and I was so happy that it turned out to be who I thought it was. I know very much want to see this book as a film just so we can see this hidden romance blossom. Would it convey well on the screen? Would people who had never read the book see it coming? And three cheers to Blue for braving the Tilt a Whirl for Simon. Thats on the same level as a roller coaster for me and believe me, sir, I get it!
ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS by Stephanie Perkins is one of the most wonderfully charming novels that I have had the pleasure of reading in a long long while. because it hosts an amazing romance that is honest, endearing and totally swoon worthy. Cest Magnifique!!! Just like drinking hot cocoa on a chilly day, once I began ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS I was filled with a warmth and satisfaction that soothed my romance hungry soul. The relationship between Anna and St. Clair was slow building, fun and tenuous and although a tiny part of me wanted instant gratification and have them make out from the beginning because they are so perfect for one another I was surprised at how much I truly enjoyed the romance that slowly built between them. I am know that my glutinous romantic soul is used to the over the top, BAM! wenevermetbutoncewelockeyesoneachotherwearesoulmates type of relationship that I forgot how amazing a true romance can be. Thank you, Stephanie Perkins. One of the factors that I found surprising was the many facets of relationships that were explored within this book. Friendships, Marriage, boygirlfriends and how each are handled through different characters give this story substance and and edge that keep it from being sugary sweet. I will admit to hating St. Claires father with a passion intensity of a thousand suns, but we always need a villain in a story to throw our hatred at. What is also amazing about ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS, besides Anna and St. Clair and its memorable cast of characters is the descriptive quality of Paris, the city of lights. After reading about Notre Dame, Point Zero and the many theatres that were at the heart of this story I wanted to feel the cobblestones underneath my feet, breath in the fresh air and see the lights dance on the river seine. And if that wasnt enough Stephanie also made me want to indulge in french bread, fruit, paninis and crepes like nobodies business. I was left practically salivating when I read about how Anna was enjoying her nutellabanana crepe masterpiece and knew I had to have the same. I have marked it down on my To Do list for when I visit Paris later this year. So, as you can witness I adored this book for many reasons. I could go into greater detail but that would only rob you of the experience that you must take. What I know is that I finished reading ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS and was left with warmth in my heart and a lightness in my soul that I will not easily forget. A story that is a feast for all the senses and for all ages, you must read this book. NOW!!
In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me. He presses his lips against my forehead. Youre still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be. This book wrecked me in the best possible way  Im still being caught in the whirlwind of emotional turmoil, feeling the sorrowfulness in the hole of my shattered heart slowly seeping through my soul. I have been suggested to start reading this book blindly, even without having a glimpse at the synopsis, but it was too late at that time because I had seen it several times. It somewhat worried me, I thought it would affect my connection with the story, but boy was I wrong. I totally did not see it coming. The brutally painful, heartwrenching, ugly, naked truth. The story was very difficult to be read because it was heavy with raw, emotional punch at the personal level. I could barely breathe for almost every single page, like I was anchored in the water as well. The fluid writing style made me fall in love and also fall apart  as if I was a part of the story, but honestly I doubted I could walk through all of these messes if it was me. I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down were all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others. I must admit I adored all of the characters in this book, especially Lily, Atlas and Ryle. They were all flawed and broken, which made them beautifully human. It was saddening to uncover their pasts and travel along their constant struggles for survival  to live a better life, to behold on the hatred and compassion at the same time when everything hideous terrifyingly turned the superficial happiness over. There is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes do bad things. To simply say this was another aestheticallywritten book by Colleen Hoover would be an understatement, because it was so much more. It delivered a strong and sensible message to all of the readers with powerful impact. I smiled through the beginning, and then wept through the rest of the story. The delicate layers of story entwined with characters complexity totally made me feel it. Still feeling it. And if you could only read a book under contemporary genre this year, read this. Song Recommendation: Love in the Dark  Adele You have given me something that I cant live without You mustnt underestimate that when youre in doubt But I dont want to carry on like everything is fine The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight Please dont fall apart I cant face your breaking heart Im trying to be brave Stop asking me to stay
Type: Standalone POV: First Person Dual  Third Person Rating: ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review FBR with shhlutty Liz and shhexy Loyda. With his family gone, Nick Ryder had nothing else to lose. He had just one more goal he needed to meet  destroy the life of the man who destroyed his. He was determined to avenge his family by any means necessary. Aubree Culling was the wife of Mayor Michael Culling, the man on top of Nicks hit list. To the public eye, the couple was portrayed as model citizens and savior of Detroit. But behind the gleaming facade, Michael was corrupted to the core and held too much power for a single man. With help from Alec, a cyber vigilante, Nick paved a bloodied path to his revenge. However, he soon learned not everything was necessarily what it seemed. When I first came across Ricochet, the cover absolutely demanded my attention. I have a weakness for mysterious hooded hero. And when I read the blurb, I knew this is my kind of book and I am very happy to say it met every expectation I had. You punch a brick in the wall, your knuckle bleed. You shoot a gun, it recoils. You destroy a mans life, he seeks revenge. An eye for an eye. This was my first Keri Lakes book and as long as she keeps writing dark contemporary romance, I will keep reading. Her writing was evocative and made me feel like I was part of the book. I especially love the details in the factory towards the end of the book. I could almost smell the rusted metals. Anger was where I felt alive. I needed it to survive, to feed some twisted, charred part of my soul which Id been waiting for a plan, craving something I couldnt formulate inside my own head. I admired Nicks determination in following his revenge plan  how he stayed true to his goal even as circumstances changed. He was pretty much an open book. His reasons and motivations were not secrets, yet he still retained that aura of mystery. Aubree was a strong female character with her own set of ghosts. I love how Nick called her Pistol Lips  she just fired things out of her mouth without thinking of possible repercussions. Alec was such an enigma and I loved him. Even though his appearances in the book were limited and brief, he commanded every scene he was in. He had a presence that made you focus your attention his direction. As for the story, the revelation took me by surprise because there were clues but interwoven with misdirection. There were a lot of violent graphic scenes in both sides attempt to gain their goals. But they were balanced by some scorching sexy scenes too. And a lot of flashback scenes just tugged my heart. So there were a lot of emotions brought out by the story. The stars in the sky are the souls of people we love. They shine so bright not even the night can hide them. And when were lost they guide us. Will you be a star someday, Daddy? Ricochet is highly recommended to those who love dark romance and dont mind graphic violence and super hot sexy times. For more reviewsrevealsgiveaways visit:
Starr Carter is 16 years old. She was the only witness on the night her best friend Khalil was murdered by a police officer. When news that Khalil was unarmed when he was shot, riots break out in her neighbourhood and the case gains media attention. Now, Starr needs to decide whether or not to speak up and seek justice for her friend or stay quiet to protect herself. This book was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement in my opinion it does an amazing job tackling serious issues such as racism and police brutality. Not only does it cover these important issues, it also explores family, friends and community. There are so many important messages in this book told in a way that its not in your face, but done exceptionally well. I think this is a VERY important book and EVERYONE should read it. This book is definitely a roller coaster of emotions and worthy of all the hype it is receiving! I cant believe this was a debut novel! Starr is such an amazing character who has no idea just how brave and strong she is. She stands up for what she believes is right and wont stay quiet for long. I loved how you watch her grow from being afraid of what her friends from Williamson will think of her, to realising that she should be herself no matter what. Not to mention, her voice is so funny and had me giggling nonstop! I loved the ENTIRE cast of this book! Starrs mom and dad were absolute perfection. They were hilarious and extremely supportive of Starr. Also, can I just say.... RELATIONSHIP GOALS?!?! Seven and Sekani, Starrs brothers were awesome as well. They were always there when Starr needed them. The diversity in this book is so well done as well. I am clearly very white and have grown up in a white neighbourhood for my entire life so it is hard for me to relate to what Starr and her familyfriends went through in this book. It was interesting to see the interactions between everyone in this book and their differing views surrounding Khalils death. I think that Thomas did an amazing job getting her message across in an effective way that wasnt thrown in your face like some authors attempt to do. I loved how by the end of the day. it was about the characters personality and persona not their skin colour, like it should be. Overall, I think this is going to be a book that is talked about and loved for many years to come.
 spoiler alert  Finally an author whos writing is just so damn satisfyng reading. It just seems right! Ok I loved this book so much that I never wanted it to end. The charachters were all so lovable and I want them all just to make it out ok and be happy! There is something going around the states where children just drop dead from one day to another. The other kids are afraid and the grown ups treat the whole thing like its just another common virus spreading around but they also seem to be all afraid. Of what tho? Their own children? Well thats absurd... right? Things getting even worst for Ruby when she wakes up one day and her parents dont remember her and then call someone to pick her up. Unfortunatelly the people that are comming for her arent there to help her but to protect others from her. That means chaining her up, stuffing her in a bus full with other restrained kids and taking her away to a hellhole. She finds out that she and all the other children have something in common. A supernatural ability to twist someones mind, start fires, mess with electricity, be super smart or have telekinisis. So they sort them all into groups depending on their powers. Orange, Red, Yellow, Green or Blue She also learns that the more dangerous are the Orange ones which she seems to be a part of, but from sheer piece of luck no one seems to know so she manipulets someone to pass of as a green where she tries to make herself not stand out. That all till one day after 6 years, when an alarm goes off and she is exposed as what she truly is. Thankfully she gets to escape before they can kill her like all the other Oranges over the years. But the people that save her are as suspicious as the one that kept her locked away all that time, so she runs for it at the first try she get and she stumbles upon a group of kids who will help her escape everyone who wants to harm her. Even tho I would have loved to see more of the powers that the kids possess. I mean if I had supernatural powers, afraid or not, I would use them every chance I got. But these children are basically ignoring them. I really loved all the characters but more of all of them Liam! Oh Liam... you precious Cinnamon Roll....
Red. Gold. Pink. Brown... Colors are more than just part of the rainbow in Pierce Browns debut novel, Red Rising. They are a way of life. A distinction. A social construct created to establish order and hierarchy drawn from Roman roots and meted out with a fierce hand of power. Darrow captures center stage of this brilliantly written novel depicting his initial life as a lowRed in the underbelly of Mars. He slaves away as a Helldiver and is devoted to his wife with a sweet love. Then tragedy strikes. There is more to Darrows existence than he once thought as he discovers the Reds have all been fooled. They are not working to terraform Mars for the future, but are instead enslaved by the society already living on the surface. Fueled by rage, motivated by love once lost, and equipped with intelligence, Darrow becomes something more than even he could have imagined, forsaking all that hes ever known in order to exact revenge and free his people. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel many are categorizing as an Adult Hunger Games themed work. Darrow is a hero created to go beyond typical borders of current, popular dystopian novels. Browns writing is strong and thick, like the muscles Darrow grows into, and you always have the sense that something great and fantastic is approaching just around the corner. As the first in a trilogy, I found the structure to be typical and some plot aspects to be expected, yet it didnt detract from the story at all. Browns expert characterization and bold descriptive writing fill the pages with a carefully constructed world. His full and complete ability to immerse readers into this new world is what grips you and will not let you put the novel down. I fully recommend this to fans of the Hunger Games trilogy and Veronica Roths Divergent series though I would advise it for older readers 17 as there is adult language and offcolor humor not typical with what I generally review or recommend. In all though you will find a startlingly real world that will have you fighting for Darrow and tied to the book until the end.  I received a free copy of this book for review purposes, but was under no obligation to read the book or post a review. I do so under my own motivation and the opinions I have expressed in this review are honest and entirely my own.
Hottest scene EVER! Merged review: Obsidian was an awesome read. I instantly felt connected to the main character, Katy, and of course I fell in love with Daemon, even if he did act like a complete jerk throughout most of the book. I truly am a scifi nerd, so anything to do with superhuman powers or hot aliens from another planet definitely grabs my attention. Daeman was like a cross between Clark Kent and Four from I AM Number Four, not Divergent with an attitude that was borderline Jace Wayland and Patch Cipriano. Just so you know, that is pretty much the perfect man in my eyes and that is before you consider his dark hair and glimmering green eyes... YUM! Okay, okay, I will stop with the lusting after a fictional character long enough to finish my review : Katy and her mother are new to a small town in West Virginia. Katys father died three years prior and her mother felt they both needed to move on and leave Florida and their old life behind. It isnt the worst thing for Katy considering she is kind of an introvert already with her passion for reading and writing bookblogs. That is until she meets her hoterthanhot next door neighbor, Daemon, and he turns out to be a complete ass. Worse is the fact that his twin sister, Dee, and Katy have become best friends in a short time and Daemon has made it perfectly clear that he doesnt want Katy hanging out with his sister, insinuating that both he and Dee are better than Katy. When Katy discovers the real reason Daemon doesnt want her anywhere near him or his sister, Katys life is altered forever. Not to mention that she has become a target for Daemon and Dees enemies and Daemon is now forced to keep a close eye on Katy so she doesnt lead their enemies to his doorstep, or so that is his excuse for making sure Katy stays where he can see her at all times. I cant really say much more about Obsidian without giving too much away. It was amazing and I did not want to rip my eyes away from the pages, or kindle screen in my case. I cant wait to read the second book in the series and get more of Daemon. If you havent bought Obsidian already then do so now!
OMG OMG OMG OMG...How long do I have to wait for book 3? Seriously, how long? I dont even know what to do with myself right now. Golden Son by Pierce Brown is book two in the Red Rising trilogy and if you arent reading this series yet, take my word for it, you best get started. I was one of the hold outs  just ask Meg...but I will forever be telling her that she is right because this was one of my favorite books of 2014 and I cant even really tell you why because I dont want to post any spoilers. I ended up binge reading both Red Rising and then Golden Son because the story was JUST. THAT. GOOD. This is a Science Fiction story packed with action, sad parts, happy parts, violence, and more. With all of that said, I decided that I would just leave you with the following for a review. Trust me, I know it is cheating, but I know that I will never be able to put it into words  at least ones that make any sense and are coherent. Pierce Brown is some sort of evil genius and I cant even tell you how impatiently I will be waiting for Morning Star...I dont even know what to expect!! Part one of Red Rising starts when Darrow is 15 and Brown starts everything out with a bang...I mean, by the end of it I was wondering what else he would be able to come up with to even compare. No worries  Brown definitely delivers and continues to do so through Golden Son which begins 2 years after Red Rising ended. Darrow is now 20 and the book begins with a lot of action. Where before Darrow and the group were at the Institute, now we get a bigger picture of the world these characters live in  the planets, the way the golds live, and also life for the other classes. This book has everything I love in a story and that is all I can say about it. If you only read one book this year please dont only read one book though  there are so many good ones out there!! , it should probably be this one.... This book had me turning the pages because I never knew what to expect next and all I have to say to Pierce Brown is: AND AND FINALLY Thank you to Netgalley and Random House for the review copy.
I was convincing myself that the most productive thing to do at 6 in the morning was to read Ugly Love. So I caved in and read it. I tell you I thought I would just fall apart reading it. Luckily I didnt, well barely. Although the hurt in Miles damaged past just about crushed me. Every time I get to read a glimpse of Miles past I felt as though I was short of breath, I was anticipating, hoping. Four hours later, I was a blubbering mess, read the HEA and now Im pleased. I have so many favorite parts, these are some. I guess people may find this weird but this part was indeed sexy to me. It cracked me up. Its just sentences, but.. Read... Sorry, I mutter. I was thirsty. He turns to face me and leans his shoulder into the refrigerator, folding his arms over his chest. I dont care if you drink my juice, Tate. Oh, wow. That was an oddly sexy sentence. So was his presence in delivering it.  I just realized this days ago, made me appreciate my job more. God gives us the ugliness so we dont take the beautiful things in life for granted.  This one was part of an emotional scene, but this made me go bonkers.. Hehe Why couldnt you have just been gay?  This one gave me a totally new perspective about lemons.. Yes, its the evil in all of us. You ever heard that expression, When life gives you lemons . . .? Make lemonade, I say, finishing his quote. Cap looks at me and shakes his head. Thats not how it goes, he says. When life gives you lemons, make sure you know whose eyes you need to squeeze them in.  And this is what you call falling in love. I know the thought of confronting your past terrifies you. It terrifies every man. But sometimes we dont do it for ourselves. We do it for the people we love more than ourselves.  To confirm : Miles, I say with a smile, youre looking at me like you fell in love with me. He shakes his head. I didnt fall in love with you, Tate. I flew. 5 flying squeezed lemons : JB
Reread: April 17, 2012 Anna and the French Kiss is just as good the second time around. I couldnt help but come back to this book after having read Lola and the Boy Next Door, which ties in the characters of Anna and St. Clair after they have returned to America and are attending college in San Francisco. . Rereading books has always been kind of difficult for me. Sometime I just cant shake the feeling of knowing what will happen next. But with The French Kiss, Anna has such an engaging voice that I got lost in the story and it felt like I was reading it for the first time. This is incredibly impressive. I have a feeling that Stephanie Perkins is one of those authors who knows how to write books that readers can come back to over and over again. I know that Anna is definitely a favourite of mine and I cant wait to come back and read it again in the future. Original Date Read: March 1922, 2011: Rating 3.5 very specific Stars Romance. The romance sub genre of young adult lit can be much debated when considering difference in taste and how much exposure to the genre one can handle before reaching for something deep and thought provoking. Sometimes these books can leave you cringing but with the positive reviews Anna and the French Kiss has received from almost everyone and their mother I imminently added it to my TBR pile and am glad I have finally gotten around to reading it. Anna and the French Kiss is everything a young adult romance novel should aspire to be. It is smart and well written with interesting characters, a variety of relationships and drama without becoming whiny or overly saturated. I loved the pace at which the story progressed and how the relationship between Anna and St. Clair developed and the moments shared between them as everything comes together and periodically falls apart. One of the major pluses for me with this books is that it actually felt like I was reading a romance novel, with a storyline that didnt solely act as an excuse for the next big dramatic climax. Stephanie Perkins has managed to create a excellent blend of great characters and a doeshelikeme? love story that is interesting and engaging without having to resort to overly dramatic willtheywontthey? ploys every odd chapter. I read through this giddy as a school girl, and although it wasnt necessarily laugh out loud funny it was humorous and a just overall enjoyable read. Not quite four stars for me because although I have no qualms it lacked that extra to leave me thinking WOW!. Anna and the French Kiss is still however a must young adult read.
Its hard for me to feel anything but pure love and warm fuzzies over anything Harry Potter related, but unfortunately that was not the experience I had with this book. Now its no secret that I hated the epilogue to Deathly Hallows, so admittedly I was never super excited about the existence of this new chapter with the kids. That said, I went in optimistically after all the rave reviews from friends and loved ones. Ive had a number of people tell me their overall rating of the book was in large part influenced by the nostalgia and happiness of returning to the Wizarding world; totally fair and I dont begrudge anyone who did find that joy. Unfortunately, this same desire for a nostalgic dopamine boost is exactly why I had an inverse reaction and am giving a low rating. I did not find that feeling of home in this book and the lack of familiar comfort where I expected to find it was disturbing and depressing to me. I missed my trio so much and I looked forward to being back in their company...but it didnt feel like them at all. These iterations felt like alternate universe and yes, some of those existed too versions of my dear characters, and not just because they were older. I personally found everything just a little off, like someone tried to approximate the world of Harry Potter but got it slightly wrong at every turn. I found the plots farfetched and not grounded in the reality of the world and characters we knew for seven books. Cedric turns into an evil dark wizard because he was embarrassed? Are you kidding me? This felt especially not in keeping with his character as we knew him in Goblet of Fire. I could see someone very prideful turning dark because of embarrassment, but it didnt feel at all right for Cedric. Bellatrix and Voldemort had a love child? Okay, I read that fan fiction already and it was better written. Some of these absurd plots could have possibly worked if they had more nuance but everything here felt like a caricature and instead of feeling home, it felt like a shell of the real thing, and left me only wanting to go back and reclaim that real feeling by rereading the originals. This isnt to say it was all bad: I thoroughly enjoyed Scorpius and the action kept me more interested throughout the second half. Still, I think Id rather no Potter book than this one.
Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. 6TH YEAR AT HOGWARTS This is one of my favorite books of the series so far it went by so fast for me and there were so many things I just thoroughly enjoyed. It just got a lot darker and I love how the book started off on the relationship between the muggle prime minister and the minister of magic and explaining that story which I found super interesting and I loved that time Harry got to spend with Dumbledore before leaving him of at the burrows which is always a an amazing place to be. We got to see Fred and Georges joke shop which was so amazing and impressive. I felt like a proud mother. Its never a normal year at Hogwarts if it doesnt involve danger and security measures so naturally harry wants to get to the bottom of it. Reading so much more about Tom Riddles past and story was so interesting and all the things he went through just to get to where he is now. It was also very frustrating how harry was spending all his time doing 5 things at once but no one around him seemed to believe him about Snape or Draco. Dumbledore never telling Harry when he already knew almost everything it would have saved so much more time especially learning about the Horcruxes which by the way was so cool. Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. Ghosts are transparent. One thing I completely enjoyed was the romance in this book. Harry having this sudden urge of jealousy towards Dean and Ginny and Ron looking after her sister, Ron making out with Lavender every five seconds and it hurt me so much to see Hermione in pain, Harry actually in a relationship with Ginny which I totally fangirled about once it happened. Just so many emotions running through my head. One of my favorite scenes in this book was when Harry asked Luna to go to one of Slughorns parties with him as friends and it just proves shes become one of my favorite characters. Nobodys ever asked me to a party before, as a friend. Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine too? Obviously the ending was so sad and hurtful and my heart felt betrayed but I knew it was coming and I could do nothing to stop it I guess thats why it took me so long to finish the book because I kept putting of the ending. I guess one thing that kept me happy by the end was Bill and Fleurs wedding which Im ecstatic for.
I read it just because everyone talked about it. I thought it would be a boring book and would be written about a poor hero struggling to get food everyday, it was named hunger games, so obviously that picture came into my mind. But for the first time i was happy to be proved wrong. the book sucked me right in from the very first page, it was so so good. To tell you the truth, I dont have the exact words to describe how awesome this book was. I was surprised by the strong character of Katniss, how being a girl she struggles so hard to keep her family alive, her mother , her beloved sister, Prim. It happens in a postapocalyptic world, where 12 districts are ruled by the twofaced cruel Capitol, where people are controlled with fear of the Hunger Games. In this world a game is held every year where tributes are chosen from each district who compete against each other finally leading in a bloodbath with only one Victor, these games are held to show the people that how they are powerless, they are weak, they have fear, against the Capitol. But this Hunger Games with Katniss and Peeta in it definitely turn this fear into hope, showing how hope can overrule fear and darkness. It definitely shows the sisterlove when Prim is reaped in the Hunger Games and Katniss volunteers instead of her, trying to save Prims life. She believes that she will die on the first day in arena, but she is proved utterly stong. i am just fascinated by Katniss strength, truly the Girl On Fire. Morever, for the record I am in Team Peeta, NOT Gale. Peeta is just a darling, i wish I could somehow make him real. My heart bleeds for Peeta. As the story continues, the readers along with Katniss ,face new hardships for survival. My heart stopped I may have become a ghost now, when Rue died. How people can be so cruel? I hate the Capitol, especially President Snow and the Head Gamekeeper. The story is weaved perfectly without the slightest of blip and it sure will make your heart twist and untwist a thousand times. It will always keep you at the edge anytime ready to throw another twist at you. So be prepared! Scifi and dystopian and romance lovers should grab this book as soon as they can. I hope you like it, i hope you love it, I hope you obsess over with it. Just like me.So what are you waiting for? Run to the bookstore! Now! It is also available in Kindle, PDF and epub format. Enjoy it! I hope this review helped you to decide. Your comments are most welcome. Love, Arpita
This is one heck of a rollercoaster ride. I am still thinking about this book and how it ended. How I feel about that ending. It is pure and simply WOW! A must read! I was sucked into this story within the first few pages. Who wouldnt be with a blub like this: In her twenties, Emma Blair marries her high school sweetheart, Jesse. They build a life for themselves, far away from the expectations of their parents and the people of their hometown in Massachusetts. They travel the world together, living life to the fullest and seizing every opportunity for adventure. On their first wedding anniversary, Jesse is on a helicopter over the Pacific when it goes missing. Just like that, Jesse is gone forever. Emma quits her job and moves home in an effort to put her life back together. Years later, now in her thirties, Emma runs into an old friend, Sam, and finds herself falling in love again. When Emma and Sam get engaged, it feels like Emmas second chance at happiness. That is, until Jesse is found. Hes alive, and hes been trying all these years to come home to her. With a husband and a fiance, Emma has to now figure out who she is and what she wants, while trying to protect the ones she loves. Who is her one true love? What does it mean to love truly? Emma knows she has to listen to her heart. Shes just not sure what its saying. I dont think that true love means your only love. I think true love means loving truly. Means loving purely. Loving wholly. Im having a difficult time writing this review because this book is just that good, my thoughts are all over the place. Who she chose in the end, how I feel about that decision. How my heart breaks for the other love. This book is going to be with me for a long time and that is amazing thing as a blogger. The good ones always stick with you! Taylor paints us the perfect picture for us, it feels like you are Emma. You are making these decision for yourself. That alone makes you vested in this story and tugs on your heart strings. There is love, love lost, angst, forgiveness, growth and acceptance. I was emotional drained, my heart broke and my heart mended its self, it was pure literary perfection!
At first I wanted to rate 2 stars, but then I realized that I rated so many books 3, though they werent worth it and now it would be unfair to give 2 stars to this one. But Red queendidnt catch me. It was kinda dull, very predictable and the main heroes were unbearable. On the other hand, I started reading it directly after The words of radiance by Brandon Sanderson and after something so genius any book could look dull. Anyway, I can mention a few things: 1 I hated the love triangle or square?. From the beginning it was obvious to me that Mare is going to choose Cal over Maven I had two different versions of this and one of them appeared to be the right one. Okay, but why? Both Cal and Maven lacked something, they were onesided and there WERE NO STORY BETWEEN MARE, CAL AND MAVEN!!! I mean want minute she loves Cal I kinda understand this one, because he kindasaved her a few times and the other minute she hates him again, whats the reason? and the she is kissing him, and then she is kissing Maven, and she loves Maven, and she is betrayed, and she hates him, and it hurts ohsomuch, but everything is so... plain. I missed feelings, wondering, I missed problems that were real. It could have become an amazing love triangle or square, but it didnt touch me. I felt that author put this love triangle, because she needed a love triangle, not because there was a reason for the heroes to fall in love. 2 Mare. What is her problem? Everything. Id expect her to change, to start thinking differently, to evolve as a person, but in the end she is the same lost girl as in the beginning. She couldve become a good heroine, but she lack strength. And personality. 3 The world had potential, but it was left as a background. What changed that some became Red and some became Silver? What is the story behind the war? And the revolution, gosh, the revolution!!! When I asked my friend why she loved the book su much, she said  wait until the end. And I waited. And nothing happened. Okay, okay. I get it. What a betrayal! Yeah............. no. I expected this author had to deal with Maven and this way was really really convenient. So just... no. But I get why some people like it. This book has what I usually like in YA fantasy. But this time it didnt work on me.
This book was AMAZING! I enjoyed it more than Red Queen cause I really saw the plot twist coming in the last book but this one just blew my mind! I love how complex the characters are and that you can see the flaws in all of them. We really get to see how all of this constant action has taken its toll on Mare and of course Cal too. In this book we see even more betrayal but also a lot of trust and to what extent trusting is possible. My heart sank and sprung in this plot line. I love mare as a character but she can also piss me off to an incredible extent but that makes her REAL and I understand her, how far that is possible looking at everything she has been through. I loved Cals little rant at her towards the end of this book if you have read it youll know what part I mean :  because it really showed what she had been hiding in her heart and how strongly the words hit her but it also showed Cals vulnerabilities. I really hope that Mare manages to open up in the following book instead of shutting everyone out. Everyone is going through this war together, and although she may have played a larger part in it, everyone has scars from it. Now some of the stuff that annoyed me slightly: I really hoped I would get to know more about the world they live in, and we did to a certain extent but I wish there would have been some more explanation. Im too curious! I also found it difficult with the amount of new characters introduced, mainly the New Bloods and trying to remember their names and their abilities was pretty tricky for me. I would have enjoyed to have seen more of the development of the New Bloods and get more of an idea of their diverse powers and training. In the last book the love triangle was put on low key which I really liked but I felt that the love issues were much more apparent in this book. I understand that that is a natural development, but every now and then it became a bit too much. I also understand all of Mares insecurities but it came to a point that on literally every page shed say something downgrading about herself or on the contrary, something about how strong and amazing she is. Just got on my nerves a bit BUT OVERALL, this book played with my emotions and pulled me into Mares world even more and I LOVED it.
 Greed may do your bidding, but death serves no man. Kaz Brekker has been offered a huge sum of money to complete a heist that he almost certainly wont survive. Brekker assembles an unlikely team of five other specialized criminals and sets out to perform the trickiest heist anyones ever attempted. Its very easy to notice bad pacing in a book, but we often overlook good pacing. Six of Crows flows in a way that there is never a second of boredom, but the story has room to breath. It isnt slow or rushed and I just wanted to take a second to appreciate that. Pacing is incredibly important in a heist novel and Bardugo has nailed this on the head. We are given several different points of view throughout the story, five of our main characters narrate regularly though Wylan being left out still irks me a bit. Its hard to juggle this many POVs while also having a sense of suspense and mystery. This is something that Bardugo has managed. There are plenty of surprises for the reader, things that the characters dont reveal about themselves until later in the book, things that are planned and put into place and not revealed until later. It would be terribly boring to read if everything was laid out plainly, which is too often the case with multiple POV stories. Luckily Bardugo has managed to show us inside all of the characters without showing us all of any one character. Six of Crows takes place in the same world as Bardugos Grisha Trilogy. This was a sticking point for me, I wasnt sure if I would be able to read and enjoy this book without prior knowledge. That was not the case. The world is built, and perhaps it was a little confusing at first but its easy for readers old and new to sink into. The world, because it has had other books to build it, feels deep and full even if we only need to see slivers of it for this story. There is almost nothing to complain about in this book. The romances were a little convenient, I never like seeing every character pair off happily ever after, but they were so well written its hard to take issue with them. Theyre not happy, flawless relationships and each couple has to deal with a different set of issues. The cast is as diverse and the problems they face with each other and despite how fantastic the plot and setting are, the characters run the story. There has just been an immesurable amount of thought put into each character, the setting, and the plan. This is a magnificently executed heist and everything gets explained. There are no moments of glaring plot conveniences, even when the characters fail with their plans. Nothing falls into their laps and it makes reading immensely satisfying. Bardugo has written a book as intricate and amazing as any trick that Kaz Brekker could pull out of his sleeve, and I cannot wait for the sequel.
Well, Gardens of the Moon is the first book Ive managed to finish since December which isnt a comic book or a manga after my Sanderson hangover, so I guess thats saying something. This book had been on my reading list for about six years, which should be around the time I first read Lord of the Rings. I remember my friend Usama recommending the series while we were in the middle of an online game. He had been reading it at that time and couldnt stop fanboying over it. Since then, he has pestered me to read it countless times, and I finally obliged. One important thing he mentioned, and which many others have repeated in the years since then, was not to expect much from the very first book. Apparently Steven had still been finding his footing when he first wrote Gardens, and he improved considerably as the series moved forward, starting with book two itself. I was advised to not give up, which is exactly what Im going to tell you, if you decide to read Malazan. Ill honestly admit that the first few chapters went completely over my head. There was just too much happening with shitloads of characters being introduced and so many powers at work. Easily the most high octane beginning to a series Ive read. Take Lotr, or WoT, or ASoIaF for instance. They all starts slow, then blows up slowly. Not the case with Malazan. The very first page throws you right in the middle of action, with no prior knowledge to who is who and what is what, and its up to you to figure out what all is happening. The book certainly lives up to the reputation of being a difficult read. And since there are ten books of this, I guess Im in for a long bumpy ride. xD Difficult as it might be, the book is highly rewarding. By the time I was done with a few chapters, I was starting to get the hang of the events. It just started making sense all of a sudden, and it was pretty damn good. Its a pretty unique book, quite different from anything you might have read. This book has pretty much everything I love in an Epic Fantasy. Good world building, intriguing magic system, memorable characters, and scenes with epic feels attached to them. All this without being cliched in any manner. It is a very complex book. There are just so many subplots with so many things happening all at once. It is highly paced and doesnt wait for useless explanations and background information. Erikson just gets straight to the point, and if you cant keep up, its your fault. And I admire this, a lot. All in all, a fairly enjoyable read. Im definitely gonna go ahead with the series. If you love a challenge, go for it. If you want a fairly simple with everything served on a plate, dont bother. And its ten books, so choose wisely.
I received a free copy of Faithless in exchange for an honest review and would like to thank Graham AustinKing for this opportunity. Faithless is set in a dark and claustrophobic subterranean environment. The action mainly takes place within the temples, the underground cities, or within the literal darkness of the mines. Everyone within this cataclysmic domain revere and offer service to the Forgefather. We follow a 15yearold lad called Wynn who has essentially been sold off as a slave to this mysterious cause by his father in exchange for a few coins. Wynns under the impression that hes here to study and pay homage for what should only be 12months. Perhaps the truth of the matter is a bit darker than that. The second point of view perspective is that of novice priest Kharios who has been within this territory below the surface for years and goes about his days working a forge. The narrative commences at a slowish pace introducing the areas, creating depth to characters, and explaining the scenarios they find themselves within. Wynn, new to his role, learns about his duties and the place he finds himself in at the same time as we do which led me to feel a heightened affinity towards him. Likewise, with Kharios, were introduced to his day to day routines. Its approximately 3 point of view chapters each before it reverts back to the other character. The despondent yet unique world presented here is admirable crafted. Although I found no aspect of this tale boring, the book gradually builds up pace and intensity until about 60 through where the whole atmosphere and direction of the narrative changes with potentially horrific consequences for all involved. Theres also a stunning twist at about 85. I did predict it but Im apparently a member of a small minority that does. Unique as well is that it always seems that theres some great power all around that is just out of anybodys reach. Faithless is a dark fantasy grimdark tale that isnt for the lighthearted. It features element some readers will not enjoy such as murder, seemingly needless brutality, grotesque characters, rape, and paedophilia. The final two are hinted at but not actually shown on the page. A typical grimdark trait is stories following characters who are bastards readers can love to hate. I didnt hate either of the main perspectives here. If anything the opposite and Id have made similar decisions that they do which unfortunately often have terrible results. There are definitely a few horrific individuals worth looking out for too including Ossan and Garl. Faithless is an utterly dark, unique, wellwritten, and deeply engaging grimdark story from a talented author whos definitely one to watch.
I honestly cant contain the feels right now. This is one of the best books Ive read all year. Havent really had a book hit me in the feels like this since Prodigy. Before I get into all that lets go back, back to Legend where it all began. I wont lie, I wasnt sure if Legend would be a good book and after months of thinking about it, I finally took a chance on it and bought it. Legend ended up just being okay, I wasnt sure how I really felt about it. I decided the next book in the series would let me know If I wanted to continue with the series or not. Prodigy didnt let me down and in fact hit me right in the feels. I dont think Ive ever seen a series turn around like that and just become awesome IMO. I found myself actually caring about the characters, especially Day, June and Tess. The book finally gave us background info and world building that we needed. It was an all around good book and left me counting down the days until Champion came out. So lets talk about Champion. My god what an awesome book. I was nervous about how the series would end, I was afraid I would be disappointed, but I wasnt. It was a moment where the book looked like it would end on a note I wasnt happy with,I was mad that June decided to do that Its better if I let him go and dont remind him of me bullshit. I was hoping it wouldnt end like that because I hate endings like that and they never make a lot of sense. Even tho it tookher 10 years it looks like they are finally together again Yay but that final chapter made all the feels and happiness burst out of me. To be honest I dont feel many emotions while reading most books. Champion was different from the get go. Early on in the book Marie Lu had me feeling feels I almost never feel. I was honestly surprised, that 30 through the book I was already getting hit with the real feels. I probably could have finished this book in a night but I was too afraid of ending the adventure of June and Day. The whole book was great IMO and even though I know it probably wont happen I hope we can get another book or two in this world. It has been a fun and interesting ride with Day and June and I know in a few years Ill revisit this world again. Marie Lu has slid her way on to my list of good authors and I look forward to her future books.
I wasnt sure what to expect from this book. Even though I loved all three of the Mortal Instruments books, there was no guarantee that I would like it set back in Victorian times. Well, lucky for me, I liked it just fine. In fact, I might go so far as to say I loved it. A good story works no matter when it is set. Clare, in my opinion, is great at character development. Her characters dont just jump off the page, they erase the page completely. They take away any obstacle standing between them and the reader. The surprise here, though, is that she doesnt sacrifice plot for character. There are plenty of authors who can get one or the other right, but she does both very well. It sounds easy, but if it was that easy more authors would be able to do it. Im not going to talk much about the plot here because there isnt much that can be said that doesnt give something away. I will say that readers who are afraid this is just going to be a rehash of City of BonesAshesGlass but set in the past will be pleasantly surprised. There are some similarities in characters, but the plot is completely different. If you havent read the Mortal Instruments trilogy, you may be a little bit lost as to the finer details of the world Clare has created. It is necessary to have read the other trilogy first, but it certainly will help get your footing as far as worldbuilding goes. Even though this is a VERY solid five star review, there were two things that specifically bothered me. First, the Henry character was a little two dimensional compared to the others. Im not concerned about that in the long run, Im convinced that Clare will develop him in the next two books. But, it was a little disappointing for this book. Second, there was a part near the beginning where Tessa notices that there arent photographs on the wall of her room. That managed to take me right out of the story. Is it an anachronism to think there would be photographs on the wall? In the grand scheme of things, it doesnt matter. But, it did manage to pull me out of the story at least for a few minutes and is even more noticeable after finishing the book where everything else seemed to be Victorian perfect. I dont know. It was just odd. But those are very minor things that will probably matter only to me. Team Will or Team Jem? Yes. Im opting for both. Neither of them has managed to move me from Team Jace, though. I guess Im just a modern girl. I cant recommend this book highly enough. It is fantastic. Go read it right now.
All of the waiting, the suspense, and the craziness surrounding the release of Thief was well worth it! The lack of sleep, the rollercoaster of emotions, the heartbreak, and the love of these characters has made this journey one that I will remember for a long long time. Thief totally surpassed all expectations that I had prior to the release. We all know Tarryn Fisher can write one hell of a story, but this book was just absolutely amazing! Calebs Love for Olivia is borderline obsession, but thats what makes him such a great character.I see you, even when you think Im not looking. Im probably more obsessed with you than is healthy. He compared every woman in his life to Olivia. He knew she wasnt perfect, but she was perfect for him! Olivia brought out a different side of Caleb. She made him want to be a better person, but she also brought out the worst in him! A side that would stop at nothing to have what he NEEDED I say need, because you can live without something that you want, but you cant live without something that you need Forget all you know  I said to myself. This is the one you belong with. I dont know how I knew that. Maybe our souls touched underneath that tree. Maybe I decided to love her. Maybe love wasnt our choice. But when I looked at that woman, I saw myself differently. And it wasnt in a good light. Not a thing would keep me from her. And that could make a person do things they never thought themselves capable of. What I felt for her scared the hell out of me. It was a consuming obsession. Caleb and Olivia had the power to destroy and heal each other. Every other person; Leah, Jessica, Turner, and Noah were all like bandaids. They were fillers, someone to try to patch over a wound that would never heal without being with the one person you were meant to be with. I dont even hate you, Olivia says. Youre so pathetic, I cant. I love that line when Olivia says it to Leah. After all of the hurt that Leah has helped inflict into Olivias life...Olivia still keeps it classy when telling her that shes pathetic! The ending to Caleb and Olivias story was not a typicall Happily Ever After, but then again they are not your typical Happily Ever After type of people. They both did a lot of rotten things to be together and in the end karma had leave its mark in some way. The ending was perfect for them, flawed but still beautiful and powerful!!
All the hype that weve seen for this book for the last couple of months has totally lived up to all that I expected. It Ends With Us is clearly one of the much awaited, most anticipated books of the entire year, not only from the author alone, but from the entire book universe. And guess whatit definitely warrants those titles. I dove into this book ready, prepared and knowing that my heart will suffer and swell again just like any other books of Colleen Hoover that Ive read in the past. But this one is quite different. It holds a more realistic and very empowering side to it that would knock you sideways and pull at your heartstrings even more. So here I am, yet again, still staring at the ceiling, letting everything I just read sink in to me. To say that this story is beautifully heartbreaking would be a vast understatement. And thats not even over exaggerating it. It deserves a much bigger and bolder word to perfectly encompass how much this book has affected me. This story drove a knife straight through my heart, twisted it, pulled it back out and then patched it up with all the bandaids in the world. The neurosurgeon, the florist and the homeless boythese three have taken me to heights Im not sure I ever want to get down from. But thats all youll get from me about the story. Theres no discussing or even giving an overview because I want you to experience this book the way I didwithout any spoilers, mostly blind and fully eager to navigate my own way through until the end. I laughed and smiled as much as I cried and had my heart in a tangled mess of shattered and jagged pieces. There couldnt have been a better ending than that. I loved where and how the story went. It was hard and painful, yes, but isnt that what life really is all about though? That in the end, after everything you go through, you still get even the tiniest of rewards that could repaint that smile on your face even in the slightest? That days arent always dark and gloomy, but it also passes and a better, brighter day comes along? This book is just about LIFE and LOVE and so much more. I couldnt put to words enough how much this book changed me. Theres just no way and this is the best I can do without throwing in any spoilers. Want to hear a naked truth, Colleen? Your author note in the end actually made sob even harder, spill even more tears compared to the whole book. I needed that. It was so heartfelt and absolutely moving. Thank you. My heart will never be the same. I want to have that same strength and willpower that you have. I want to be you when I grow up.
This one is now sitting on my top favorites of the year and holding a very special place in my heart. It all started with a rocket ship night light. This novel started on a high. Often times, in my past reading experiences, Ive found that when the narrative is from a childs perspective theres a bit of a disconnect in the youths voice. The words dont match up to what a child would really say, for example. In this case however, the narrative was authentic and consistent all the way through. We meet Maggie as a young child and we see her growing up at the most pivotal times. Each age presented was on point. There was an abundance of adorableness between and from young Brooks and Maggie May, you cant help but react with giggles and awws. I felt the trepidation Maggie had as she pulled into her new home, and I felt it the instant she connected with her new mom. Then theres a sudden shift in the novel and in that lifechanging scene, everything blurred and was obscured in darkness. Finding that connection to Maggie early on in the story allowed for that crucial scene to come alive and have so much power behind every word and emotion she felt in that moment and thereafter. Told through the dual perspectives of Brooks and Maggie was very enlightening. Being mute, theres so many things that Maggie doesnt express with words and sometimes cant or wont express physically. Having her inner thoughts relayed was so helpful in sensing her intense emotions. Brooks, as well, couldnt always reveal his feelings in light of Maggies unknown and delicate situation. He was so good at communicating with her nonverbally, that I sometimes forgot she didnt speak at all. Their friendship was one of immense strength, and we see the pull from the very beginning. They were bonded in ways not many people have the opportunity to experience, and it was absolutely beautiful. The authenticity of the characters and overall story development did well to keep a steady flow from start to finish. Every word depicting vivid imagery and emotion was so addicting, it made it very difficult to set down the book. Tears of joy, love, sorrow...it was all there and it was pure magic. I appreciate and value what this author can create. Her elegant prose was written with such heartfelt precision and raw originality. There are very few romance authors who can write with this level of eloquence and not have to rely on sex scenes to portray a passionate love story. Brittainy C. Cherry is a wordsmith, and I highly recommend everyone read this book and all of her backlist titles.
If there is one storyline that I am a true sucker for then it is the second chance at love storyline. There has always been something about it that has haunted me and everytime I read about it, it also makes me not only swoon but hope that what I am going through is my second chance and will end like these characters  though I do have to remind myself often that our lives cant always be like the book characters  wouldnt it be totally great though if they did. Ever since I was a little girl, I have been fascinated by true love stories that involve the second chance romance line. So when I saw the book Before We Were Strangers by Renee Carlino, I just knew that it was one book that I would have to read and I loved it. In present time  we meet Matt whose exwife Elizabeth has just announced her pregnancy to her new husband Brad and to top it off they both work with Matt at the National Geographical Magazine office . He cant stop thinking about his life and the one who got away  Grace and then one day while out at lunch  he spots Grace getting on the subway train. Its just a glimpse but it brings back flooding memories. Especially since they have not seen or spoken to each other in fifteen years. Matt with the insistence of his friend and boss decides to place a missed connections ad to Grace. Meanwhile one of Graces music students spot the add and they get together. The novel then jumps back fifteen years ago when they first met and their whirlwind college friendship that bloomed innocently into a relationship and eventually marriage. Then life got in the way, college internships, jobs , opportunities and the two despite their strong love for each other went their ways with hopes to reunite but it never happened. The novel then again jumps back to present time and alot has happened in Fifteen years , especially for Grace who assumed that Matt just forgot about her and moved on with his life as she has a secret she must think about before jumping back to him. Has Love and Life given Matt and Grace a second chance at romance and a second chance at what should have been their romantic moment in life ? Find out in this amazing book Before We Were Strangers by Renee Carlino.
This year Ive started reading a lot more Sherlock inspired YA books, and when I found out about this debut, I preordered it ASAP. In A Study in Charlotte, the descendants of the famous Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson are both students at the prestigious Sherringford school in Connecticut. Jamie Watson has been sent there on scholarship, and he knows that Charlotte Holmes is also a student. He wants to meet her, but also knows about her reputation for being aloof and unpredictable  just like her famous ancestor. When they first meet, its safe to say they both didnt make a good first impression. However, once a fellow student, whom theyve both had run ins with, turns up dead at the school, theyre both seen as prime suspects. They need to work together to clear their names, and to save themselves when the real killer turns on them. A Study in Charlotte was simply wonderful! I hated been reading much recently, due to a hectic school life, so when I came home for Easter, I decided to give this a try, and read it all in less than a day  it was that good. The plot line kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through, there was never a dull moment. Honestly, it had a real feel of an authentic Conan Doyle story, and I was in awe with how researched and well thought out everything was. The dramatic climax seemed to come out of nowhere, but afterwards, I realised there had been some little clues and hints throughout the book, all foreshadowing the end. The characters were fantastic, and so unique. I adored Charlotte  she was quirky, and definitely strange, but it felt real on her. I could see how she was related to Sherlock, and when you met other members of her family, they all had little characteristics that gave a nod back to the famous detective. Jamie, on the other hand, was a little more reserved, but considering the book was from his PoV something I really enjoyed, we felt everything he did. To be the main suspect in a murder, and then realising that the actual murderer may be after you, would mess with anyones head and emotions, so I felt that he, and Charlotte, dealt with the situation very maturely, but they were still teenagers, and we got to see them as such. Theres a hint of romance in the book, and Im hoping that it gets expanded upon in book two. It seemed very much one sided for the majority of the book, but little things, here and there, suggest that its very much a mutual attraction, which gave me a lot of shippy feels. Basically, if you enjoy Sherlock in any shape or form, try this book. A Study in Charlotte is a fantastic debut from Cavallaro, and I cant wait to read more from her.t
Ohhhhh... oh my gosh.!!!!!!!! I .. That was so beautiful!!!!! I loved it. All the characters were great and I laughed and was shocked, was confused and very much blown away. I dont want to spoil anything but I will just mostly base this review on the characters and not the plot. Emma Carstairs Emma was a really awesome character. Parbati to Julian Blackthorn where she fall in love with him but it is forbidden. She is so strong and brave and kind and loving and funny. I loved her relationship with Mark and Julian as well as Christina. Emma is smart and I loved her from page 1. She is advantourous and takes risks Mark Blackthorn Mark was a complete surprise to me. I loved him. He was very funny and innocent and aww at the same time. Mark was taken away 5 years ago after the Dark War to Fairie and he is returned in this book but he is messed up. Mark is the eldest of the kids and when he was taken, Julian had to be the parent figure. I definitely liked Mark more than Julian but I also like Julian and all the characters that I am just one big mess. I may just be on the Mark and Emma ship? I am not too sure but by book 2 we will see. The strawberry scene at the resturant Lol. Julian Blackthorn Julian was awesome. I feel his burden that he has to carry and wow. He reminds me a bit of Jem and wow that end... Julian is an artist and a really good one at it. He loves his siblings very much and will do anything for them, which I admired. I also adored his and Emmas relationship. I hope everything turns out well. Christina Rozales I have never really fancied side kick girl characters, except maybe Isabell, but Christina was marvelous. She loved everyone and could fight too! She is from the Mexican inststute and left a relationship with a guy there. I loved Emma and Chris friendship and I loved Mark and Christinas relationship. I felt all warm inside. I dont know how everything will turn out though because... Anyway the plot was so twisty and it was one one helluva ride. I was entertained for every second and I could not predict what would happen next. There are also some new elements introduced. Oh and it had lots of humor!!! I will offically die waiting for book 2.

I am definitely looking forward to more of Sawyers story!!! That badass boy can be tamed, I just know it!
12 The Last One is a standalone, apocalyptic thriller written by Alexandra Oliva. I loved the original concept of the storyline. The heroine: Zoo signs up for a survivalbased reality TV show and while competing, an epidemic of apocalyptic proportions occurs. However, she believes all the horrific real life surrounding her is a setup for the show. In her mind, the dangers she encounters are props, and the many risks are buffered by the safety of hidden cameras all around her. Her physical and mental fatigue show genuine reactions on her part, but she always has the thought in the back of her mind, This is just part of the show. OMG, this element was incredibly scary for me as a reader. Ms. Oliva lets the reader know what is going on and were left to watch Zoo wander around in a very dangerous wasteland thinking otherwise. The suspense was cringeworthy! Personally, I wish the book only focused on Zoo and her survival during the apocalypse, but it doesnt. Flashbacks of the reality TV show are incorporated throughout which I initially found confusing for multiple reasons. The flashbacks refer to the characters by the nicknames producers assigned them for the show and Zoos internal diaglogue uses their real names. It was quite the puzzle to match them up and I finally got to the point I stopped trying because I didnt care about the flashbacks anyway. Compared to what Zoo was going through presentday, the TV show just didnt matter to me anymore. The group dynamics, structured challenges, and behindthescenes production decisions took backseat and I was frustrated they kept popping up. But as a I write this, Im thinking maybe that was the point Ms. Oliva was trying to make. Reality TV is not real and reallife is much more interesting. Hmmm... Ms. Oliva gives readers another thing to think about in The Last One. The ending feels like a cliffhanger of sorts but there is no followup or closure planned to date. It appears it is meant to be an open ending. Because even though reality TV may have complete control over context and perception of every scene, the author doesnt do that to her readers. She allows us to imagine the ending we want which I think is pretty cool. Welldone on a good debut Ms. Oliva! I will definitely be keeping an eye out for this new author. My favorite quote: Even the best among us can break.
Cinder is the first book in the Lunar Chronicles series by Marissa Meyer; as you might have already gasp, by the title and the book cover, its a retelling of the classic Cinderella fairy tales with a twist. We find our self in a futuristic setting, after the end of the IV World War, peace and alliance had been settling for 126 years on earth  but now a deadly plague ravages the population and from the space, an evil queen threaten to start a war. The story takes place in the city of New Beijing, under the power of Emperor Rika who rules over the Eastern Commonwealth. Here we get to know the story of Cinder and prince Kaito and who their life will get tangled together. Cinder is a cyborg and works as a mechanics. She has no memory of her past before falling under the custody of her mean stepmother, Adri. Cinder does work hard to bring money for the her family, while being abused by her step mom and sisters, thats something that didnt differ from the original story; even though she does get along well with on of the two sister, Peony. She will cross the charming Prince Kai path, when he comes asking for her help to fix his android  but what did start with a simple mechanical task will bring herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle. Caught between what she wants and what she has to do, she will have to undercover secrets from the past in other to protect the future. It was a light read. The writing was simple, the story well balanced and paced. I think that the writer didnt do a good job with the world building living a lot of questions unanswered: Who are the Lunar? Why did they come to be on the moon? Why is queen Levana interested in the earth? So many questions still linger in my head. I would have liked a bit of background; the book focus his attention only on the city of Beijing not even giving you a complex configuration of the it but just an idea. Also the characters, apart from Cinder and Kai whom did have a good complexity, were only sketched out. It still was an entertaining read and I hope there will more space for all those unanswered questions in the next books. It feels like the beginning of another story.... 3.55 stars
Time to get your Geek on. This book was so much fun to read, I hesitate to review it. The concept, that of an online world in the prettynear future that has become so prominent as to change the way the majority of citizens live their lives, has certainly been done before. But the author uses that concept to build an absolute joyride of a read. The main character of the novel is Wade Watts, a young impoverished orphan who prefers to escape his real life circumstances and spend as much time as possible in the online world of OASIS. Turns out the original creator and developer of the OASIS has passed away and has developed a treasure hunt game within OASIS so that the winner of the treasure hunt can claim the full ownership of OASIS and the multibillion dollar inheritance that goes with it. Sort of like a Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory scenario. The story that follows could have been rather predictable but the author marvelously twists and turns and believably guides his characters into a downright awesome story filled with danger, emotion, wit, and imagination. But thats not all. What makes this novel so interesting beyond the great plot, setting, and characters is the cultural connections to the decade of the 1980s. The OASIS creator grew up in the 80s so all of the clues to the treasure hunt are found in 80s trivia: movies, books, music, and mostly importantly, electroniccomputerarcade games. No doubt I am the target audience for this novel so I suppose that is one reason I liked it so much. I also grew up in the 80s and remember almost all of the hundreds of 80s references. But Ive also never grown out of my geekdom as I still spend hours playing computer games like World of Warcraft, reading fantasyscifi, etc, because I enjoy it as well as trying to keep up with my own kids. Is this a perfect novel? No...I noticed a few instances where the plot was a bit contrived in order to make things work out properly. And there were a couple of fairly long information dumps but I, for one appreciated them and I can imagine a reader less familiar with the 80s would appreciate them even more. But those are rather nitpicky observations. All in all, a great, fun read and this will absolutely compete for my bestoftheyear awards.
Reread via audiobook Feb 4, 2015 Originally read via ebook April 2014 with a 5 star rating A new series by Kristen Ashley SQUEE!!!! I adore Kristen Ashley she is at the top of my favorite author list and I must have every book she writes. Luckily, she has never let me down. Magdalene, Maine is the town this series is based in and the characters that live within are the vehicles of the plot lines. In The Will we meet our hero and heroine at the reading of the heroines Grandmothers will, the story takes off from there. I wont get into the details of the storyline Ill only say this novel has the feel of KAs self published books which are a bit longer and a bit more rambling and over all better reads than the ones that are being published by a big city publisher. Jake and Josie are both a bit older than most main characters in books today and I for one found that so refreshing. Although I enjoy NA books they seem to have flooded the market with them and it is truly nice to have some maturity and experience in the characters and a heck of a lot less angst. I also enjoyed that Jake had children of varying ages and each had their own unique characteristics, I fell in love with all 3 of them. Josie had some really unusual friends and I will be really interested to see if any of them make their way into future Madeline books. I could rave on about fully dimensional characters, great plot with twists etc but for anyone who has read KA they know you get this in every book she writes. The feeling of this book is very much similar to the feeling when I read the Burg series. It is all about the individuals and the town that supports them. I have to admit I started this book in the morning and read it straight through for the most part staying up until 5:30am and when it was over I almost cried because I wanted more! I cant wait to see who is next up in this series. If you havent had the fortune of reading a Kristen Ashley book you are doing yourself a disservice, to me she is one of the premier writers of Contemporary Romance today and is not to be missed. 5 Brilliant stars for this first outing of a new series, I recommend you get a copy and a glass of wine and sit back an let yourself be consumed by the town of Magdalene. tirla tirlas talk book blog tirlastalk.blogspot.ca
4th read: March 2729, 2016, 5 stars. Make way for the Raven King! This book always feels new when I read it. I love that. 3rd read: June 1st3rd 2015, 5 stars. Nothing to add to my existing reviews except that I havent read a book this many times since Harry Potter or Wuthering Heights. I really really love it, the intricacies of the language and relationships and story threads. It always feels like a new book, a fresh book. Reread: September 2425th 2014, 5 stars. This book is infinitely better the second time around! I really liked it the first time my original review is below but I had problems getting into it and with the ending. I decided to reread because Im SO excited for Blue Lily, Lily Blue and this is one of those series with an immense amount of detail and nuance. Usually I feel guilty because I have so many unread books waiting their turn but Im SO GLAD I read The Raven Boys again! Knowing Stiefvaters writing style right off the bat helps, and I loved seeing the fateful twisting of strands bringing Blue and her raven boys together. It was just so enjoyable. And there were a LOT of details and foreshadowing that I missed the first time around! I didnt remember learning anything about Blues father originally. The ending also makes a lot more sense I remembered the big points of the book but I had forgotten so much of the delightful inbetweenness that it was practically like reading a new book. 5 big, important, wonderful stars. I love it all, especially the strangeness. Onto The Dream Thieves! First read: December 516th 2012, 4 stars. This was a weird book for me. I really liked it, but it took me a few days to get into it and I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I was hoping it would stand on its own more than be seen as a trilogy jumping off point. To be honest, Im curious to see what a series would look like I felt this could have been a standalone book if it was longer that is. That being said, I loved the characters!! They were all incredibly unique, and interesting, and multilayered. Their interaction with each other was masterfully done and added so much depth to the book. The story was intriguing as well; almost everything about the book, from the tone to the POV to the plot itself was unusual. I liked the mix of mythology and history along with the supernatural. I was mildly uncomfortable the entire time I was reading, waiting for the shoe to drop so to speak. I think it added to the experience of reading a mysterious and somewhat sinister book. I would definitely recommend it the writing was wonderfully lyrical and Im so anxious to see where the story will lead!
This can be enough. Just getting to kiss you is a fucking privilege. My absolute FAVORITE of the series! These characters were EVERYTHING! Laura Kaye SLAYS in this genre EVERY SINGLE TIME! RIDE WILD, book three in Kayes INCREDIBLE Raven Riders series, took me on the RIDE of my life, charming me with each turn of the page with the gruff and broken Slider, and the charming yet feisty Cora Campbell. These two are a match made in MC Romance heaven! I loved their banter, their chemistry, their intense passion they had for one another. Once the lines were blurred, THE HEAT WAS ON, and I loved every single second of it! Look at this face. Look into these eyes. And never, ever doubt that youre looking at your biggest fan, your staunchest defender, and the man who will always hold you up and have your back. I mean, could Slider BE anymore SWOONY?! I fell in love with his character long ago and when his story popped up on my iPad I was so freaking GIDDY! This man has been through HELL, and yet he has the strength to raise and provide for his children. Nothing else matters but his sons and he is just going through the motions day by day. Sweet and lovable Cora Campbell makes it a little bit easier, blending into his family so perfectly. Slider knows that the lines between employer and employee can never be crossed but Cora doesnt make it easy on him at all. They both can fight their attraction tooth and nail, but in the end, the passion and connection win out. These two definitely SET THE PAGES ON FIRE! Will you...will you be my person, Cora? Slider and Cora arent the only ones stealing the show in this beautiful romance. Sliders two sons, Sam and Ben are SO STINKING CUTE! The love that they have for Cora is so heartwarming and cute, I could barely take it! These two definitely played as the cute comic relief when things got tough, and I LOVED the dialogue between the two. All in all, Laura Kaye swept me right off my feet once again with her flawless writing and amazing and lovable characters. The Raven Riders have become like family to me and it was hard to say goodbye to them, but the epic journey in meeting all of them and watching them find their other half was one I will never forget! If you love MC Romances or Romantic Suspense or Single Dad Romances, make sure you scoop up RIDE WILD asap! You will NOT be disappointed!
Actual rating: 3.5 I had really high expectations for this book thinkiing I would love this, but I am sad to say that it wasnt all that great for me. Maybe because I had such high expectations I felt let down a little bit. Thats not to say I didnt like this book, I did truly! It just wasnt a favorite for me. Reasons I had conflicting issues with it are:  It dragged on in the middle of the book. For all the fight scenes and finding out who Mare was, I felt that it slowed down too much and made the book boring for me. Im not sure if it was too much info dump, or that everything was at a stand still, but I felt it could have been moved along more faster.  Another thing I felt was that it was a bit predictable. I figured what Mare was right away. I figured who she was going to like more, and who the bad guys were. There were a couple of moments that threw me for a surprise, but it wasnt all that much. Because of the predictability of it, I felt that is why I was also a bit bored with it. I also did not really feel the love connections she had between Cal and Maven. Maybe it was because she kept saying, I cant trust anyone so many times that thats exactly how I felt. One minute shes saying she cant trust one man, and then the next scene shes kissing him. It just had me scratching my head. I will say, that towards the end I could see a spark between she and one of the men, but it was a bit late for that. I hope to see more connections in the next book.  For all the negatives about this book, there was a big positive for me. I absolutely loved the fight scenes! The details the author describes in the fight scenes was so good. I could picture myself in the arena fighting with everyone. I liked reading how everyones different powers worked, who had the advantages of destruction, and how they would try to eliminate one anothers opponent. It was like a scene straight out of XMen or The Avengers! It was truly amazing to read those parts. Overall, this was a good book, but I didnt love it. The ending kept me intrigued enough to find out what is going to happen in the next book. I want to read how Mares power came to be and if other Red Bloods have powers as well. I really liked the dynamics between Silver and Red bloods. How is it that Silvers have power and Reds dont? I have many questions that I hope are answered in the next book.
This review can also be found at Caroles Random Life. I have struggled with how I should rate this book. I really liked a lot of things about this book but I had a few problems with it. I consider this to be a good book overall that I wouldnt have any problems recommending to most readers. I think that the three star rating that I finally went with is fair. Lets start with the things that I really liked about this book. First of all, Ruby was a fantastic character. She was smart, resourceful, and very brave. I really wished that more of the book would have come from Rubys point of view because her outlook on the world was just so interesting to me. I think that the descriptions of her hearing loss were incredibly well done and it added a lot to the story. Ruby was just an amazing child. The setting in this book was wonderful. This book is set in the winter months in Alaska. I cant imagine that kind of cold. At least, I couldnt before reading this book. I thought that the conditions in this book were fantastically portrayed. I read this book curled in a blanket hoping that I would never experience the kind of cold that I was reading about. There was a beauty to this cold wilderness that really surprised me. I didnt love Yasmin but as the book progressed I started to understand her a bit. She was a strong woman and very goal oriented. Yasmin was not afraid to take risks. I didnt like her at all for the first part of the story. The way she was with Ruby made me want to strangle her at times. As the story unfolded, her character really started to grow. She got to know Ruby a bit better and before everything was over, I had warmed up to her a bit. The main problem with this book is that it felt like two different stories to me. There is really very little cohesiveness between the first 23 of the book and the final section. I mean some of the characters are the same and they were still in Alaska but that was about the only connection. It was almost like the majority of the book was really just trying to get to the very exciting ending but it was such a sudden change in pace that it just didnt work for me. The sudden shift in the book was really quite jarring for me and took me out of the story. I would recommend this book to others. The descriptions were lovely and the writing style was really nice. This is the first book by Rosamund Lupton that I have had a chance to read. I would definitely read more of her work in the future. I won an advance reader edition of this book from Crown Publishing in a LibraryThing Early Reviewers giveaway for the purpose of providing an honest review. Initial Thoughts I didnt hate it but I did find this book to be incredibly far fetched. The overall plot lacked any kind of cohesiveness. This will end up being either a 2 star or a 3 star book from me.
So this is going down as one of my favorite booksseries of all time. Im usually a speed reader, I like to skim the filler parts and read what really matters in the book. I wasnt like that for this book. If I even caught myself starting to read too fast Id immediately stop and go back and read it all over again. I needed to read every. single. word. There is something about the way that Maggie writes that is just magical. Each and every word, even the mundane ones, seem to have more meaning when she writes them. Being back in this world was everything I wanted it to be. The characters were just as real as I remembered them and it felt like I was in Henrietta with them throughout their journey. When things got dark, and boy did they get dark, I was genuinely afraid. When something happy occurred, I was feeling that sentiment along with the characters yes, there was both happiness and sadness and every other emotion between and beyond those two poles. These werent just words on paper. The story of The Raven Cycle is so much more than that. The Raven Cycle has always been a low burner, and so I was wondering how things would finally conclude, and whether or not it would truly feel finished. On some levels, its absolutely does. The Raven King was everything the previous books promised it would be. I felt like I finally understood everything, and at the same time there was so much left to understand. The plots end in ways youd never see or suspect and, in other hands, would not have worked they way they do here. On other levels, it feel like Maggie left some question marks on the pages, and I can only hope she plans on some day coming back to them. As with every book, I had minor issues, but here they were so inconsequential that I cant even remember them right now. And Im sure if I read it back I would see that it was just misinterpretation on my part. I already want to go back and read the whole series again, because I feel like theres still so much more to discover, so much depth below the surface that I missed on the first go. Im considering doing a review on my channel for this, but it would just be me raving and full of emotions and I dont think it would do this book justice.
I love stories told in two parts, from different narrative viewpoints, and that is just one of many many things to love about this book. The first half is told by Verity, a captured female spy being interrogated by the Gestapo in a former hotel in France. She begin her story with the words, I am a coward, but you dont have to read much further before you realise this simply isnt true. Tortured, threatened and terrified, Verity proves her courage again and again. Under the cover of writing a confession for her captors, she tells the story of how she came to be a spy, how she met her best friend, Maddie Its like falling in love, finding your best friend and how the pair of them came to be in France. Were a sensational team, Verity tells us. Its this friendship that drives the story, as we try to piece together the clues in Veritys confession  being made in extremis  to get at the exact truth of what happened to the sensational team. Elizabeth Wein lays many excellent traps for the reader along the way; expect to have your heart in your mouth a lot of the time. Is Verity really betraying her country Scotland, not England? Is she going to die? Is her best friend already dead, or in terrible danger? Will the two young women ever see one another again? Midway through, the story switches to Maddies voice. This is the tricky point at which an author can lose a reader, especially one whos fallen in love, the way she helps us fall in love with Verity. But it only takes a couple of pages for us to love Maddie, too, and to marvel at how distinctly different her voice is to Veritys. These women are alive. They leap off the page and grip you by the hand, and then the heart. You desperately want them to have a happy ending, but at the same time you sense it would be cheating, or lying, to arrive at this after the harrowing and entirely believable scenes which have unfolded. To move the reader without resorting to sentiment. To arrive at an ending that is both honest and uplifting. To make you think afresh about a part of history you thought you knew. To transport you, for the time it takes to read the book, to a different time and another world, while showing you so clearly why these stories matter and how they can resonate. These are proofs positive of a gifted, compassionate and generous author. I doubt Ill read a better book this year.
Want to see more bookish things from me? Check out my Youtube channel:  VIDEO REVIEW:  I was sent a copy by the author in exchange for my honest review 3.5 Stars 19 year old Ersel is a mermaid who falls in love with a warrior named Ragna. In order to be with her, Ersel makes a deal with the trickster God, Loki that backfires terribly. The book is a loose retelling of The Little Mermaid and is inspired by Norse mythology, which I absolutely loved. I really liked how the book wasnt predictable as I thought it would be because it is a retelling! Ive read other reviews that have mentioned this is a great example of an own voices book for bi and fat representation. There is also a character who is genderfluid and uses theythem pronouns which is great! The book was very fast paced and action packed. I enjoyed the writing style and the world building. I found it very easy to visualize the underwater ice world Ember created for her mermaids to live in. I really hated the idea of the Grading and how the mermaids were only deemed valuable if they were fertile and considered damaged if they were not. I really liked how Erie didnt want to be a mother and was fighting for what she wanted instead. I really enjoyed Erie as a main character and how feisty she was. I wish there was more of a back story with Havamal and Erie and what happened in their friendship. Ragna was a great character as well. I really loved the idea behind her tattoos and think they would be such a cool thing to have! I wish we had seen more of her through out the story. There was only one major issue I had with the book, which is the reason I rated 3.5 instead of 4 stars.... there is one scene in the book where the two characters who are meant to be in love punch each other in the face to the point where they draw blood. This was unsettling to me because there was no consequences for either of their actions and it was just brushed over. In my opinion, this could be very negative for readers and may cause them to believe that this type of abuse in a relationship is acceptable, which I do not believe to be the case. Overall, I really liked the book and recommend it to everyone!
4.5 stars Beautiful, powerful, and funny even when its heartbreaking. Such an amazing combination. I really love the characters, especially Hazel, the narrator, who is WONDERFUL. The only reason Im calling this 4.5 stars instead of 5 is that there was one fairly important section where the intensity seemed to flatten out a bit, for me, and I felt less connected to the characters than before or after, even though I thought it ought to be one of the most intense sections, based on what was going on. Afterwards, I wondered if that might have actually been intentional, a kind of commentary on how that kind of situation really feels as its being experienced in real life? If it was intentional, thats an artistic decision I can respect, and which may work well for a lot of people, but for me as a reader, it just didnt work quite as well. Still, it was an amazing, amazing book that I really highly recommend. ETA: OK, a few days later, I think Ive finally got a handle on why I felt less engaged with the second half of the novel than the first. The thing is, in the first half, Hazel feels very much like the protagonist of the story  its HER story, shes the center of it  and I was SO there with her, feeling all her feelings, totally engaged at every moment. In the second half, though, Hazels role is more observer than active protagonist  its more someone elses story than her own  so its not surprising that I was less emotionally engaged by that half of the novel. This is NOT necessarily a criticism of the book, though, because I honestly cant see how the author could have handled it differently, given the very powerful storyline, and its still an amazing book. There were lots of wonderful, perfectly observed moments in that second half of the book, and I believed in the emotional truth of it wholeheartedly. I just wanted to write here about my realization because when I first finished the book, I closed it with a feeling of genuine confusion  WHY hadnt I been as into the second half as the first? I couldnt figure it out  and now I finally have. And I still recommend the book very strongly. I might not have been as emotionally engaged by the second half as by the first, but I still really, really liked the second half, found the whole book important and powerful, and I LOVED the first half of it. And I bet there are readers out there who love the second half of the book best of all.
It seems like it was just yesterday oh wait, it was yesterday that I was writing my review for All the Bright Places, complaining about how much I dislike reading about suicidal teens and all the angst. But then, I read We Are the Ants and reminded myself of why I read so much YA, including this more realistic  contemporary genre. Oh sure, our protagonist Henry is known in his high school as Space Boy because of his frequent alien abductions, but dont let the aliens fool you. This is the real deal. The premise is bizarre. Henry doesnt fit in at his school. His classmates torment him, and hes all alone since his boyfriend Jesse committed suicide last year. And his and Jesses mutual best gal friend Audrey vanished and ditched him right after Jesses suicide and they seem to be blaming each other, and themselves. Hes been hooking up with a popular boy, who refuses to be seen in public with him and bullies him in front of the popular crowd. Oh Henry. His home life isnt much better. His dad took off several years ago, his grandma is losing her faculties to Alzheimers and manages to ruin any of the familys attempts at cooking, his brother dropped out of college because hes working for his pregnant girlfriends dad, trying to save some money for the coming baby, and his mom is coping with this plus her crappy job as a waitress by drinking lots. And then there are the aliens, who show up when Henry is alone and take him up to their spaceship, and later drop him off pantsless, naturally somewhere embarrassing around town. The aliens ask Henry if he wants to push a shiny red button which will save the world from certain destruction in just over 2 months time. And Henry doesnt know. Oh Henry. And then, one day in science class, Henrys favorite class because yeay science and also a supportive teacher, a new student shows up. One who is new to town, with a mysterious past. Ive said enough about the plot, as it is actually important in this book, unlike so many YA books where the plot is just there, as set dressing for the many flirty scenes and quotable dialogue. Not this book. The plot matters. Things happen. Real things that people have to deal with. And Henry needs to decide  is this world worth saving, worth living in? The audiobook is also quite decently done.
As you can see, Eden Newman, the protagonist is a White woman who wears blackface. Eden does this because from a post apocalyptic earth, where Pearls read: white people are oppressed by Coals read: blacks. Because of the higher levels of melanin, Coals were better able to survive the harmful suns rays. Of course, the dark races got The Heat too, but not nearly as often. The higher amounts of melanin in their skin protected them from the suns radiation. Since their numbers hadnt been decimated in the Great Meltdown, as the other races had, they now ruled the planet. page 14 I cannot begin to tell you how horrifying the very concept of this book is. How this White woman thought this role reversal would read as anything more than appropriation and racism is absolutely beyond me. Foyt even goes as far as to include a scene where Pearls perform in White face. On the main stage a band of Coals performed in Whiteface. Edens sensors told her their name: The Lost Caucasian Tribe. page 40 So its not bad enough that we have a protagonist tromping through the majority of the book in Blackface and whining about the fact that she is White and noone sees the real her, but Foyt decided to appropriate Blackface. In this scene, those performing werent othered and it did not read as a minstrel show. There was no historical meaning to this supposed whiteface and it only served as yet another reminder of Hoyts racial ignorance. Asians are referred to as Ambers, which essentially calls their skin colour yellow and is offensive. We are told on page 11 that Pearls is the racist name for Whites, yet this is the word that Foyt uses for the entire book to describe White people. They are also referred to as earthdamned Pearl and White death. Suddenly this reversal of power means that there are racial slurs which effect White people and futuristic or not, this flies in the face of human history. It is further troubling that though we are told that the term Pearl is indeed a slur, so is Coal. This tells me that Foyt has no idea how a slur really works. A dominant group is not effected by a slur and the fact that she chose to give slurs to every racial group, undermines the supposed superiority that Coals have. If Coals were the oppressive force that they are supposedly cast as, Coal would not be considered a slur, just as honky, gringo, cracker and paleface arent slurs today. Read More
I had heard several not too complimentary reviews of this book prior to reading it. The common thought was that it wasnt as good as the authors previous book. I purposefully didnt want to read Ready Player One before reading this book due to this. I believe this really helped me to realize if I enjoyed the book on its own merit without being able to compare it to the authors prior work. I usually like to read books and their audio version in conjunction with each other. I had heard from others what an amazing narrator Wil Wheaton was also, so I really wanted to give the audiobook a listen. In this case, I had been on my librarys Overdrive waiting list for months and was still six people away from obtaining my loan by time I finally decided I could not put off reading this book any longer. I literally read 19 pages then put the book down for a while. I just wasnt interested. Fortunately, I was at my library a while later and they happened to have a copy of the audiobook on CD, so I snatched it up. After listening to a few chapters, it then finally started to pull me in. I ended up devouring the last half of this book in two days. I honestly have to say that if it wasnt for Wil Wheatons narration, Im not sure how long it wouldve taken me to get to the place in the story where it finally started taking off for me. I understood almost all of the pop culture references and the story really had a nostalgic feel to it, even though it takes place in the present. The family elements gave me the feels at times as well. The story is a bit reminiscent to me of the movie War Games with Matthew Broderick. Even the main character has the same last name in both. There is some instalove, and though it is understandable in the situation that was occurring, the story wouldve worked just as well if it was an instafriendship instead in my opinion. I do wish the end was slightly different, but that being said, I still think the story overall was enjoyable and would recommend it especially if you are an Ernest Cline newbie like I was. After my experience with this story, I can only imagine that Ready Player One will be spectacular. I received this book from the Blogging for Books program in exchange for this review.
I never really had much desire to read this book. However, it was recommended to me by a fellow group member and many people I know have rated it highly so I decided to give it a shot. Firstly, the things I expected to annoy me were there and they were annoying. Im not a huge fan of YA fiction. I find teenage girls in literature really quite irritating. I was a teenage girl a decade ago and that was quite enough without having to read the thoughts of one. I did, however, feel that John Green did create a believable teenager girl in Hazel and I felt that her comments and thoughts seemed realistic. I am not so sure how realistic Augustus is. He seems too old to be a 17 year old boy but maybe he has matured due to his illness. The second thing I found annoying was the romance. It was just a bit too sugary and easy for more liking. From memory, teenage relationships and generally a bit more clumsy and with more fumbling than this one. I suppose your first date being in Amsterdam and your relationship having a time limit perhaps brings things forward a bit but it just seemed a bit unnaturally easy. Thirdly, and this is purely because of my particular knowledge of the area, I found some of the medical details a little lacking. This isnt really a criticism. I work with patients with cancer and I did actually feel a lot of the medical side was really well done. Probably because I know too much, I dont tend to like reading fictional stories about medicine because I always want to know more. On to the things I did like and there were definitely some! I found the story moved at a good pace. I wasnt bored and it was an easy read so I finished within a couple of days even with limited spare time. I did genuinely feel for the characters and I smiled and cried a bit. I knew what was going to happen but I was interested to see in what way in happened. Overall, I have to give this book 2 stars. It wasnt a bad book at all and I did enjoy my reading experience. But I feel a little empty, like something amazing was meant to happen as I read the book and it just didnt. I think perhaps by preconception that I wouldnt like it took away some of the reading pleasure. I am pleased I have read it but I wouldnt pick it up again.
This review is also available on my blog, Qwerty It started with a cup of hot tea I made at 1 am. Darjeeling tea to be precise. I felt craving for hot beverage after a few rounds of UNO tournament with my housemates. While waiting for the drink to cool off a little, I decided to pick up the book where I left it off at around page 100 or so. It was a wrong decision. I even forgotten that the hot drink was there. I ended up going to sleep at 5.30 am. Which obviously pointing out at one thing. Im a painfully slow reader. Well, I wanted to savour every word of this book! Oh ya, another obvious thing... THIS BOOK IS FREAKING GOOD!!! After Unearthly and Angelfall last year, I had a season of drought when I could hardly find a phenomenal book like this. THIS.IS.IT. It took me forever to borrow the book from my local library. The requests keep coming in. That explains why I had been so left behind of this awesomeness. Id say now... I SHOULD JUST BUY THIS FREAKING BOOK. Well, I almost feel reluctant to review the actual book. I believe Ill be repeating what the other awesome reviewers had said. But Ill review it anyway because I can. Haha! Since Ive read Angelfall and Divergent first, It was hard for my brain to adjust that this book came before those two. And if there are any intentional resemblance to The Hunger Games, its Veronica Roth and Susan Ee who have to answer to us. But soon, I didnt care much because I was too engrossed in the story and the actions. The narration was simple enough, not many catchy phrases or mind bogging words but the philosophy runs deep. As brutal as The Games, I couldnt help but to question, are we being control to that extent as well, but with more subtle disguise? I would totally vote for Raffe against Gale or Peeta because this book IS about Katniss. Although without any male characters to be swooned for, I feel like the emphasis on Katniss was a smart move by the author albeit the risk. Im kind of nervous in continuing with the series right now because I had a very terrible experience with the second book in any series so far. Hopefully, Catching Fire would be able to break the consistent streak. Im not sure if I would be glad if Suzanne Collins would like to start writing about a new series because Im afraid, when you reached max level, you stop leveling.
My fav is problematic: Leigh Bardugo. Shes perfect Like seriously leave some talent for the rest of us She writes sexy men with no promise that theyre actually real Her books are perfect Who even does that There was no cameo of me in a bathrobe and pizza rolls, as per discussed on Twitter a few months back. Im searching for the right things to say about this book, but I guess the only thing I have to put to words is that this book is so good, I want to fuck it. I would fuck the shit out of this book. Risking the paper cuts. I want to have sex with this book. My kindle just sprouted legs and scuttled away from me as I typed that. Just kidding. If you dont think I bought the sexy, sexy hardback, you dont know me at all. Hard. Back. Lets be real, its hard for me, as a person who dedicates a vast amount of my time nagging for Leighs attention online, it is very hard for me to isolate her grace and kindness from the finished product. Haha just kidding, this finished product is fucking amazing. This reminded me why I sought her attention in the first place. Leigh Bardugo knows everything I ever wanted as a reader and she delivers, every fucking time. If you want breadth and depth into wonderful characters, you got it. Kaz is... the greatest. Inej my favorite thing put to paper. Nina is the queen of my heart. All these characters are delightful rascals. I want them in my house under curfew so nothing bad happens to them. I want them at my wedding. I want to throw a sleepover and braid everyones hair. I want to face death with these people. Bias aside, Read Six of Crows. Read Six of Crows. Completely hypeworthy. Leigh Bardugo can tell a fucking story, and as soon as I heard this premise I had chills because I knew she was in her element. Even though my enthusiasm dipped a bit prerelease, just based on a distrust of the explosion of promotion, my faith was restored from page one. My only complaint is that both female Crows are in some state of peril at the end of the book, and the men are worn down and trying to save their respective love interests and friends, but thats also because the bargaining chip of suspense is being very well used against us by having my two favorite characters in so much danger and left hanging. Leigh has the winning hand, were just waiting for it to play. This is similar to my pain over limited SB references. Each one had me choking, but I wanted so much more. I think the hardest, most painful part of this book was there were moments where I was waiting for Genya, Mal, Alina, Sturmhond, even the Darkling to step in a take up their parts in the story. And whenever they werent there I wanted to cry. I will say one or two aspects were a bit predictable. But when you cant trust anyone in the Barrel, Im fine with letting that slide because its about how you handle the surprises.
As seen on The Quiet Concert So heres the deal. I know I give out a good number of 5 stars, apparently 32 according to Goodreads. That being said, even though I think every book I gave 5 stars to was deserving of it, I dont know how much my 5 stars are worth to yall anymore. But I would guestimate that of that 32 of 5 stars, I suffered a book hangover from maybe 5 max. AND I SUFFERED A BOOK HANGOVER FROM THIS BOOK. You guys, I am not even kidding you when I say that I finished this book and immediately wanted to start from page 1 again. And that NEVER happens. I am pretty much always on to the next book no matter the depths of my love which speaks volumes for this book. So for what its worth, you REALLY need to read this one. The Wrath and the Dawn was intoxicating. Thats the best way to put it. It starts with Shahrzad volunteering to marry King Khalid, even though he murdered every wife he married prior to her on the morning after. Shes gambling her life on the fact that she can intrigue him enough to delay her execution long enough to kill him. And intrigue him she does. Shahrzad was enthralling. She used every advantage she had to gain the upper hand and this woman was an arsenal. Obviously the situation was complicated. Khalids not the monster everyone assumes he is, but the truth is a closely guarded secret, one Shahrzad is determined to learn. I could root for Shahrzad all day and I enjoyed watching her strategize but I loved it even more when her feelings started to change from hate, to pity, to something that takes your breath away. The connection between these two characters could start a fire and I unquestionably loved them together. Khalid made me swoon like only the best of them have. I honestly couldnt get enough of either of them, individually and together. I am always a fan of multiple POVs, but especially in cases like this one when it not only gives us a deeper understanding of a relationship, but also develops the story in other ways. There is a growing rebellion in the kingdom, led by Shazis childhood sweetheart, in an effort to get her back. Through a few different POVs, we meet a variety of interesting characters, get a glimpse of some dark magic use, and watch the rebellion unfold. It was a nice complement to what was happening in the castle. But really, there was so much more that this book had to offer, I am only brushing the surface. In summary, I loved everything about this book and it is one of the best I have read in a while. I devoured it and I loved every second of it. I think everyone should read this book, but if you like Fantasty and retellings, than it would definitely be a mistake to miss this one! A new favorite!
Omg this was the best one yet! Review to come later once I have processed it Wow each book M writes gets better and better. She is a pure evil Genuis with keeping you hooked, destroying you and then putting you back together to destroy you again before the HEA she gives you. I was so desperate to read this after the way Crave Me finished, I needed to know what happened and omg what a ride up to that point where you catch up to that final scene. Alejandro Martinez is a very bad man. A hot sexy bad man who eluded power and danger. His name El Diablo has been well earnt with his actions. Even though hes the devil you cant help having a lovehatelovehatelove relationship with him. You see all sides of him throughout this book. Its a real emotional Rollarcoaster starting with what happened at the beginning to put him on this path of darkness and loneliness. The story starts with him as a teenager, his father is the mob boss who wants him to follow in his footsteps and be the most feared man. I dont want to say to much about what happens to spark this change from the teenager to the devil as it will give it away and ruin the ride for you but I will say it broke my heart. Lexi is a beautiful angel in this story, she finds her way into your heart straight away. Shes had a hard life, noone has really been there for her, shes been alone most of her life. She knows what kind of man Martinez is but she only sees the good in him, to her, he is Alejandro. She blossoms into a strong and determined woman who will not bow down to anyone, Alejandro included, and she will do what it takes to follow her dreams of being a ballet dancer. Martinez knows Lexi is his Achilles heel, she is a danger to him and her by simply being around, she creeps under his skin, letting him feel emotions that he hasnt felt in years, giving him hope, but he knows his life is too dangerous for him and her to be in it. She cant be his weakness and he cant bury someone else he loves. He constantly warns her that he is a bad man, he builds her up to keep knocking her back. He breaks her heart again and again but she still keeps coming back to him. Loved the scenes with the good Ol boys at the christening, and cant wait to read more from them in November. M. Robinson is the queen of angst and thank you for another amazing book and journey with characters that deep into your sole. She is the author who you just one click as you know her books with take you quite the journey and whos characters you will love regardless of what they do. ?I was extremely lucky to receive an ARC copy of this book from the Author ? 
This is such a wonderful book that makes you excited not only for to continue the journey of the characters but to also explore a rich world filled with mystery and magic. I was afraid because this is such a hyped book but I now believe the hype! Sarah J. Mass took a decade to have this book from conception to publication and you can definitely see that it did paid off. The plot is rich but not rush. She takes her time in really developing the world and the characters journey. She often leaves the reader in the shadow making you try to guess whats going on and what it all means along with Celeana and THIS is what I love about this book! It leaves you in mystery for most of the book. If you can see for my banter as I updated my progress, I suspected EVERYONE. It kept my guessing and I loved it! The writing is rich and takes it time to really describe the setting and everything surrounding our characters. It is not a book that suddenly a thousand things happen and you just keep turning the pages. No, it is a walking pace plot where you keep reading not because of the action but because of the intrigue. Is not a quick read you really have to take your time and read to truly enjoy what the author has carefully crafted. The love in this book takes a back seat to the plot WHICH IS GREAT TO SEE IN A NOVEL! There is also a love triangle that definitely doesnt feel forced or rushed, it naturally develops. Is worth the read. The characters are amazing! Celena is a kickass lead that also has a soft heart and is vulnerable. Dorian is such a charmer and fun character who really is lost and I am looking forward to see how he continues to grow. Then we have Chaol, who reminds me a lot of Four from the Divergent series, he is strong and very professional but you see his facade fall off from time to time. Then, we have Nehemia, which I keep pronouncing as Nehelenia, the character form Sailor Moon. Anyways, she is an amazing wise character. Overall, the characters are well fleshed out and compliment each other as an entire cast but also the story. If you were like me and havent picked the book up yet. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! Go get it!!
I have been putting down my tbr list this book, and I didnt exactly dont know why I did it. Now that I read it, I certainly was missing a lot. This is my first CoHo book and it began with the right foot. I love it! Read this book, fella. Miles is an airplane pilot. Tate is a nurse. Tate moves in with his brother, Corbin, and the first day she finds out a passed out man in front of the door, Miles. He is Corbins best friend and coworker. Well, it results that Miles is a jerk and Tate is a moody bitch, so the next day they decided to start over. From Tates pov, Miles is a strange guy. Someone that doesnt smile and if he does isnt often, someone focused in his job and living day by day without giving much away. But the sexual tension between them can be cut with a knife, for real. So they decided to make a deal, sex without attachments. He puts two rules: Dont ask about my past, he says firmly. And never expect a future. Basically who really breaks these rules is him. Yes, she wants to know about his past from day one, but she doesnt verbally asks. And she never expect a future, she wished, but she knew that it wasnt going to happen. Miles might have follow those rules very rudely, but from the beginning you could see that he was hurt, didnt want to be hurt again, so certainly he wasnt going to cross the line, but he did and everything was perfect. Miles, I say with a smile, youre looking at me like you fell in love with me. He shakes his head. I didnt fall in love with you, Tate. I flew. I love every chapter. I like the insight of his past in his pov. I like that when he was in love the format of the text was in the middle and written like a poem without a rhyme. I really really loved Miles and I know there is a movie that its coming soon... I hope that Miles does him justice, because I swear that I really loved the character. His story was really sad, but sometimes you have to live the ugly love first for then being happy. Its all worth it. Its the beautiful moments like these that make up for the ugly love.
I really wanted to love The Wangs vs. the World by Jade Chang. After all, I have either liked or loved all the Chinese literature that I have read up to now. Also, my husbands family name is Wang but there was a mistake during immigration. I had read so many reviews about this book being so funny, I thought I would love it. I did not find it funny at all. Charles Wang, the head of the family had immigrated to the United States from Taiwan but did not consider himself Taiwanese. He had made a fortune with cosmetics in the United States because of a special ingredient, urea from a factory in Taiwan. There was a reversal of fortune and Charles kept throwing good money after bad. He lost his mansion, all of his cars and everything! He decided to take his family to New York to live with his oldest daughter. The only car left to ferry his family there was the one that he gave to his mother. The description of the car is great, the author has great skills of describing things. Charless second wife Barbra, chose to be named after Barbra Streisand. That is not unusual. I know an immigrant who took John Waynes name because he loved his westerns as a child. They have two children, Grace who is crazy over fashion and a son who is a part time comedian. The whole family is going. Charles is on and off dreaming of his ancestral inheritance in China. Somehow he thinks he can still claim it after the massive change that China has gone through. I kept reading and reading this book, searching for the humor but when I found something that seemed like it could be stretched to be humor, it always went sour. After so many sour points, I even resorted to bribing myself with a chapter in a different book for a chapter in this one. The author is great at description and comedy is very challenging so I would prefer that she switched to a different genre. Also the transition between the different scenes seemed abrupt. But the biggest disappointment was that a book reported to be funny was not. I received an Advanced Reading copy of this book as a win from FirstReads from the publisher but that in no way determined my thoughts or feelings in this review.
Six of Crow has everything you hope to find in a fantasy book! This time, Leigh Bardugo really did it for me. She has always been a great writer and creator of worlds in her previous series The Grisha Trilogy. But Six of Crow is so much more exciting, mature and dark. It takes place two years or so after the Grisha trilogy. And it is very different, and I mean it in a good way. I love adventure, a good fight and of course some romance. She did that and much more with this book. I couldnt stop reading until the last page... and then I had to google when was the next book coming out. Found out that the Tittle of the next book is Cooked Kingdoms. So freaking awesome. I can only imagine what it entails. I love Kaz... He is the perfect character, a little bit dark, mysterious, sad but loving at times, rough around the edges but deep inside hes got a soft heart. Plus he is a thief, a great one at that, and everyone likes a bad boy every now and then... Nina and Inez are both lovely and deadly, very different, yet they have a lot in common. Jasper and Wylan are very interesting and very unpredictable but somewhat great together. They are definitely the most funny out of all the characters. I laugh a lot with them. Matthias is unpredictable, the one that stunned me the most... very loyal to his cause thou and so romantic. The romance wasnt the biggest focus on this book and I like that, because it allows you to get to know the characters in a deeper level first. I also prefer a romance that is developed over time, once you know every secret, every fear and every desire of that character. I am sure the romance will pick up in the next book... And I am excited for that! I would really love to see a little more about Kazs past and life before the Dregs, as well as Inez life before she was taken from her family. It would be also nice to see some old characters return, from Grisha to help the crew.... TO SEE THE COMPLETE REVIEW OF THIS BOOK, CHECK OUT MY BLOG  No mourners. No funerals. GET THIS BOOK! I DONT GIVE 5 STARS OFTEN.
This was a superb read, and handsdown the best of the series so far. The plot was incredible; full of suspenseful twists and turns, and an imaginatively created fantasy world that I loved. The pacing was spot on, and even though its a big book, I never felt that any part dragged. The writing was great, as usual. At this stage, the characters all seem so real to me, so much so that I feel quite intensely about them. There are minor inconsistencies with some of the characters, and there were plenty of times when a few of them really grated on my nerves, but thats a side effect of being so invested in them and their stories. Honestly not a bad thing. Aelin has really come into her own, and she was amazing in this book. Sharp, shrewd, brave, snarky, and cunning are all words that spring to mind. I adored her and Rowan in this book, and they are so perfect together. And Rowan is just perfect book boyfriend material. Swooning. I disliked Chaol for most of this book, and I hated the fact that he was pinning so much blame on Aelin when he was the one who sent her away in the first place! He vented a lot of his own selffrustration in her direction which was massively unfair. Thankfully, he took his head out of his ass by the end of the book and redeemed himself. I actually enjoyed Manons POV this time around, and the witchy subplot added depth and an additional layer which was lacking in Heir of Fire. I figured Elide was going to reappear though its still unclear what value she offers, or what role she will play. Dorian. Poor Dorian. He has really been through the wringer. I hope he has what it takes to see this thing through, and that hes not too damaged. Im still intrigued to see how him and Aelin as a magical unit fit into the overall picture. Aelins dark side still wriggles beneath the surface and Im wondering if she is strong enough to fight it off in future books. There is definitely potential for her to turn to the dark side, and wouldnt that be an interesting turn of events. All in all, this was fantastic. I cant wait to read the next instalment. This review will shortly be posted to my blog: 
How do I keep a review of my absolute favourite book in the world short and simple? This book gave me feelings. A lot of feelings. This is the third time I read it, so I am not as much fangirling as I have done after reading it for the first time. But still: This book is like my soulmate. Before reading it, I did not even know that I would like what it is like. But now I love cars, speeds, forrests and Wales. Thanks Maggie. You did not only make me love your characters but also love the things they love. It is just to good for the world. So fast pacing. Well, maybe not the first hundred pages, because there goes a lot of time until Gansey and Blue finally meet and understand who eachother is. But after that, time flies by. Maggie Stiefvater knows how to write good stories and good characters. There is so much humor in the book which I only realised by reading for the second time. The thoughts of the characters are funny, thoughtful, melancholic and sometimes even a little bit insane. Just like I feel:D Maybe I do like the book so much because I identify with all of them so much. Sometimes I want to be like volatile and reckless like Ronan, sometimes interlectual and ambitious AND RICH like Gansey, sometimes extravagant and receptive like Blue and even sometimes I want to be like Noah and Adam. Even though the last Raven boy really got on my nerves sometimes. I just wanted to shake him and scream: COME ON, LET OTHERS HELP YOU. THATS NOTHING BAD I also just loved the whole fox way family! Persephone, Calla and Maura are so best friends goals! This is what kind of relationship I want to have with my best friends when I am older. This whole book feels like a dream. The atmosphere is stunning. Maggie writes so beautiful that I have an excact picture of Henrietta and his citiziens in my mind. It is like a finished movie in my head. No questions, everything is so detailled, I just love it. I really need to have a tv show of it: Last point: The whole world she created is so unique. Dead welsh kings, enchanted forests, sparkling vintage muscle cars and raven boys. Can a book be to perfect? It feels like I am having a depression because of Blues awesome life. Such a great family, beautiful and hot friends and big adventure coming for her. Blue has everything what I always wanted to achieve. Why are you so mean Maggie? How can you create something so flaweless? Do you know how I feel?: 55 Stars for this perfection.
Im torn on this book. On the one hand, I loved the story, which is, as another reviewer put it, the greatest, most incestuous Greek epic since the Iliad. On the other hand, I had serious problems with some of the writing. I havent seen my quibbles mentioned anywhere else, so I guess Im alone on them. Or am I? In a nutshell, Middlesex is the story of Cal, a Greek American who was born a hermaphrodite and raised as a girl before finally realising he was boy as a teenager. In about five hundred occasionally brilliant pages, Cal traces back his family history which is rife with inbreeding to see how he came to be the sort of almostmale he is. In so doing, he not only paints a loving picture of the memorable and colourful Stephanides clan, whose men have rather special ways of wooing women, but of a changing world, all the way from the Greek part of earlytwentiethcentury Turkey through midtwentiethcentury Detroit to postWall Berlin. What with its focus on different conflicts in different eras, the book is quite epic in scope. Yet it is also quite personal, with the social and racial conflicts played out in the world at large reflecting the much more private conflict that is going on within Cal. Both the epic and the intimate aspects of the novel are funny, poignant and tragic, and for that Jeffrey Eugenides deserves applause. Lots of it. But. But. But. I have to admit to finding Eugenides an awfully inconsistent writer. While he undeniably has a flair for storytelling, he also has a mad tendency to change tenses and perspectives, to the point where it actually quite took me out of the story. I dislike stories which switch back and forth between past tense and present tense within a matter of paragraphs at the best of times; if these stories also come equipped with narrators who constantly switch points of view, I get annoyed. And this is exactly what happens in Middlesex. Not only is Cal an omniscient firstperson narrator who shares with the reader details from older relatives lives which he has no way of knowing, but he also has a maddening tendency to randomly refer to himself in the third person, which results in sudden bursts of Calliope this and Calliope that in what is essentially a firstperson narrative. To a certain extent, I can see why Cal would do this, looking back from a distance at a person he used to be but no longer is, but still, I found it annoying, so much so that I occasionally found myself wanting to scream at the narrator to drop all that thirdperson shit and stick with the first person, for Gods sake. I dont like feeling like shouting at narrators, so thats where one star went. The other one I deducted for the weak ending, which felt rather rushed to me after the perfectly lavish setup. Is it me, or would Middlesex have been a better book with slightly more information on what happened to Cal between the ages of 17 and 41? With an actual, you know, ending and all that? Ill stop complaining here to end on a positive note. Despite my quibbles, I enjoyed most of Middlesex  especially the first half, which is superb. I quite like Eugenides brand of modern mythology, so I think Ill give The Virgin Suicides a shot, too. I rather liked the film, so Im actually quite surprised I havent read the book yet...
This book was just absolutely marvelous. The romance was swoonworthy and beautiful. The characters were real and flawed. The side characters werent 2D, they were just as round as Echo and Noah. The Characters: I cant say this enough, I LOVE Echo and Noah separately, and together the ship is unstoppable. Both have issues that seem impossible to overcome and how Katie McGary writes this story is just amazing. The ending isnt perfect, because life isnt perfect. You see so many different perspectives on the same story, its not just how Echo and Noah can have a happy ending, its how everyone in this story can be at some sort of peace. Echo Emerson is scarred mentally and physically. With a few permanent scars of when her mother attacked her, she is constantly reminded by a day that she doesnt even remember. Echo went from popular girl, to scarred freak, and is slowly trying to get her life together again. And lets not forget the fact that she has to deal with her dad who wont let her do the one thing she loves, and a stepmom who used to be her babysitter. Noah Hutchins... enter swoon here Swoon has been entered Noah is one of the sweetest bad boys I have ever met. He might curse, he might use girls, he might do drugs, but he has the heart of an angel. As you can tell, hes bae Hes been thrown through the foster care system and have seen it at its worse. Noah is fighting for the custody of his two younger brothers who are living with a foster family. And when Noah suspects that something isnt right with this family, he is willing to do anything to find out. And how do these different characters with these different backstories end up together? You might ask. They meet through therapy and bond through tutoring. But to be honest, I love how Ms. McGary makes it known that therapy can actually be helpful, that its okay to trust and to love. And she shows how to treat a woman correctly. In some stories, the guy orders the girl around and treats her however, but thats not how Noah treats Echo, and I think thats what made this book so precious to me. Even though Noah is the bad boy in this story, he respects Echo wiggles eyebrows in a suggestive manner, and truly, absolutely loves her. I think I was sold by Page 1, and fell in love by Page 14.
I didnt love this. No. I need a stronger word than love. Obsessed? Infatuated? Giddy? Whatever, take your pick. But Oh My Joshua, I am crazy for everything about this book. The writing, the humor, the lust, the sexual tension, the emotion, the slow delicious burn. This is probably the best enemies to lovers stories I have ever read. Lucy Hutton and Josh Templeman work together at Gamin Publishing and Bexley Books and they have hated each other from the moment they met. They spend their days trying to out do and frustrate the other, play these ridiculous games but I must say the Kissing Game was my favorite one, and their ultimate goal is to basically make the other cry. They are total opposites  Lucy is lovable, hysterical, and a people pleaser. Josh is a smart ass, grumpy, and cynical. So painting your nails tonight, desperately alone? Lucky guess on his part? Yes. Masturbating and crying into your pillow, Doctor Joshua? He looks at the top button of my shirt. Yes. And dont call me that. Reading about these two fight? I was in TEARS. This was HYSTERICAL. What are you imagining? Your expression is filthy. Strangling you. Bare hands. I can barely get the words out. Im huskier than a phonesex operator after a double shift. But reading about these two falling in love? My heart almost couldnt take it. All I want to do is kiss you until I fall asleep. I want to slide in between your sheets, and find out what goes on inside your head, and underneath your clothes. I want to make a fool of myself over you. The first smile Joshuas ever had in my presence is pressed against my lips. I love him so much its like a thread piercing me. Punching holes. Dragging through. Stitching love into me. Ill never be able to untangle myself from this feeling. The color of love is surely this robinsegg blue. And my favorite line of all the lines: I fucking love your red. Joshua snuggling? I swoon. Joshua being romantic? I die. But when Joshua gets jealous? For the love of all that is holy, I cant deal. Joshua Templeman is a GOD and I love him unlike like anyone or anything. He is mine. And I will fight you for him. The end. There is no greater feeling than picking up a book and not expecting it to live up to the hype, only to find it does. IT SO DOES. If I could give this book 6 million stars I would. If I could shout from every rooftop TO STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND READ THIS RIGHT THIS SECOND I would. Do yourself a favor and read this phenomenal debut novel! See, he says into my mouth. I dont hate you, Lucy. The Hating Game is out now!   Find Me On: Instagram FB Page FB Blog Blog
Not my screwup. My real. This book was more than just a great read..it was AN EXPERIENCE! I have been sitting here wondering what the magic formula is for an epic book, and the biggest answer that I came up with is: Real has that magic. What made me fall in love with the character of Remington Riptide Tate was from his animal magnetism, his possesiveness, loyalty, agression, vulnerability, and most of all: he was Real! The intensity of this man is off the charts!! What woman would not want a man to look at her as if the sun shines and sets on her, and with every part of his being needs her to be by his side. With every ounce of Remys soul he has found a home within Brooke, and will protect her with every breath in his body. He says it best when he tells her: Protecting you is my privilege. I will protect you and anything that YOU value as if it were mine. Katy Evans has introduced me to a character that I will never forget, and a man that is not only hard to beat in the ring; but as far as Book Beaus go...he is unbeatable as well. The sexual tension in this book was unfreakingbelievable..there are no words as to how worked up I was!! By the time Brooke and Remy did the deed, the butterflies in my stomach were fluttering like crazy, and I swear if a car drove into my house I wouldnt have even noticed. I have never read such and intense sex scene before..EVER!! Katy Evans has such a powerful way with words and I wish I could do her justice by how great I think she is. I was so absorbed into this book, that when it came to the end I wanted to start back at the beginning and read it again! Truthfully, I will miss Remy and Brooke..they are trapped into my heart for good and their story is one that I will treasure for many years to come. This book has touched me in ways that I never thought a book would. My hat goes of to Katy Evans, and I applaud you for writing such a wonderful story. Truly my words dont even do justice to how great it is..but one thing is for sure: Remy and Brooke will live on in my heart for all time!!
Im rating this a 4.5 stars. Silence settles the room as the queen pauses to dab at her eyes, wiping away what I know are fake, forced tears. A few of the girls, participants in the Queenstrial, fidget in their seats. They dont care about a dead general, and neither does the queen, not really. This is about me, about somehow slipping a Red girl into a crown without anyone noticing. Its a magic trick, and the queen is a skilled magician. Red Queen follows a world where the colour of your blood Red or Silver determines your rank in society and wether or not you have inherited a power. Our main character, Mare, is a Red fighting for survival by any means necessary until she discovers she posses a power only Silver blooded person should have. She in thrown into court life with only a thin lie to protect her from the unsuspecting Silvers as well as the rest of the world. From there she does everything in her power to fight for equality. Red Queen took me by surprise because of all the mixed reviews I read. I found it exciting, mysterious, and fast paced. There were so many twists and turns I didnt see coming. So many great moments that as I reflect I can see the hints and foreshadowing. The plot is intricate, despite its similarity to other novels, and never boring. The characters are lively and feel distinct from one another. There are a few characters perspective that would have been interesting to read. Mare is not what I was expecting her to be. She was stubborn, strong willed, intelligent, and resourceful all coupled with some vulnerability. Maven and Cal were interesting characters as well. I enjoyed how the author was able to paint them as complete opposites, but still able to show the reader a brotherly bond. There was one point in the book that I was so disappointed in the turn the story took concerning the two brothers, but that was solved in a way that was so interesting and crazy! The one thing that I will say about this book and why I didnt give it a full 5 stars was the amount of similarities to other books. It wasnt just plot similarities it was full passages from the Red Queen that screamed it came from another book. For example: Revolution needs a spark, I murmur, repeating what Julian would say in our lessons. And even sparks burn. This to me sounds like it could have been pulled from The Hunger Games. He cant let me die. He wont. I am the little lighting girl, and I am going to make the world change. The Hunger Games once again. And my personal favourite. Youve taken my son from me! You have done that yourself! This mimics almost perfectly one of the final scenes in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Overall, despite its similarities I cannot wait for the sequel because this is such a fast paced novel with great characters and twists and turns you wont see coming! And that ending though. So badass!
 spoiler alert  Wow, this book. This was so refreshing! Especially for a young adultfantasy book. It brings me back to the days that I used to only read fantasy. I miss the journey books of the protagonist learning the art of what they are to become. Mias story was intriguing, many protagonists may start like Mia, but the magic system is what really sucked me in. Mister Kindly was such a mysterious and loyal character and he seemed like a great ally to have. But there comes a part in the book that you question all that he is. I loved this! It made us so suspicious of the shadows surrounding Mia. The opening paragraphs of this book was so interesting. It was so confusing and I found myself rereading these paragraphs to compare the different situations written so similarly. I had to find out what was going on! And I was drawn in by Jays writing style. References at the bottom of the book answered some of the questions I had, gave us insight to Nevernights world without one character explaining it to another or heavy information all at the beginning of the book and some were quite funny. Eventually the complicated writing style evened out and it became an easier read. The flashbacks at the beginning of each chapter gave us insights to Mias past. I really liked this as it kept us curious the more I read and knowing how it linked to the present. What I also loved about this book was that Mia went to learn to become an assassin and the classes and classmates that she encounters. I have to say, I miss reading books like these, especially when it is in detail and I love the trials and difficulties all the characters go through. I found myself becoming quite attached to the friends Mia made, especially Tric! I was also very drawn to Cassius and wanted to know more about him, hanging out for any glimpse of him in the story! Overall, an amazing read, I could not put it down! It was refreshing for young adult to have a book that was more fantasy then previous young adult books Ive read. It seemed to combine the two well. The magic system was intriguing and is still mysterious. I loved the ending of the book, we are left with even more questions that are hopefully answered in Nevernight 2!
 a billion stars Oh my god this book. It was the first book I read in the vast genre of dystopiautopia and it has already become my favourite. Right from the start I was hooked and couldnt help loving Katniss. Whatever Suzanne Collins wanted me to feel, I could feel it through her brilliant writing. But first I want to talk about Katniss. She is undoubtedly the heroine of this book. She is strong but vulnerable, not really attached to relationships but at the same time cares about her family , especially Prim I loved their sisterly love. Like her, I myself couldnt make out about her actual relationship with Gale but loved how close they were. And I was almost crying when Prims name was announced at the Reaping and Kat volunteered for her. And just like Katniss, I was completely terrified about how the games would be like. And on the day Katniss had to leave Prim and her mother and Gale, I knew how helpless she felt. I completely felt disgusted about the Capitol and their ways, their indifferent attitudes, the helplessness of the district people. And the actual games were also very very interesting, not that I enjoyed reading about tributes killing each other but because how strong the survival instinct was. Initially I was really clueless about Peetas love for katniss. I too thought that this was only about the sponsorship but at the end I felt that his love for her was for real. I cant wait to read what happens to them next. Not to mention that Peetas characterization was very interesting. He is vulnerable and scared but Katniss couldnt have survived if not for him. I am really happy with the ending scene of the games when both Kat and Peeta are about to eat poisonous berries and defy the rules of Capitol people. It all brings out the rebellious attitudes which I love so much. A special mention for the friendship formed between Rue and Kat in the arena and that covering of Rues dead body with flowers and the fact that Rues district people sent a parachute for Katniss for her gesture. It was one of the few golden moments of the book  along with cave scenes with Peeta in a book otherwise filled with fear and survival. Also all the other side characters were very interesting too like Haymitch, Effie and Cinna he was lovely. And I am already off to read the second book : I would like to write about it thoroughly once I complete the trilogy.
This book gave me all the feels. I am not joking when I say that I cried three separate times during the course of reading this, and they werent always sad tears. They were happy tears. I was crying because Cassandra Clare ended the series in such a way that while my heart was breaking I was smiling, I wouldnt have had it end any other way. I have decided that in this review I will give absolutely nothing away so I will just tell you things you already know are going to happen, that do in fact happen. There is a showdown with Mortmain and his clockwork creatures, we find out what exactly Tessa is, Magnus makes appearances in all his Warlock glory, and Clare redefines the love triangle with how much she makes me love both Jem and Will. Lets talk a little bit about this love triangle. As you might remember from my Clockwork Prince review I am pretty much a die hard Team Jem kind of girl! I think that is why I went in to reading Clockwork Princess with so much worry and trepidation. Jem is sick and we have all known since the first book that Jem getting a happy ending seemed unlikely. I was afraid Clare was going to cop out and just have Tessa pick Will and leave Jem hanging. I should have known that this was wrong, the author that brought me my favorite love triangle of all time wouldnt do something like that, and thankfully she doesnt. Everyone gets their own ending and while it might not suit everyones fancy it is honestly the only way I could ever imagine the series ending. What surprised me most about Clockwork Princess was actually how Jem and Wills parabatai relationship is explained and even expanded. I knew they were close I guess I just never realized how close. It was actually these parts of the story that broke my heart the most. It was so refreshing to see how much one person could love another in a purely platonic sense. Jem and Will are more then just a friends, more then just brothers, they are parabatai and I now feel like I truly understand what that means. It wasnt the love triangle that made me cry happy tears, it was Jem and Will and the love they have for each other that made me cry. Overall, because I dont want to give anything away it almost feels like I cant say anything at all. You will just have to suffice to know that the Epilogue made all my tears worthwhile, and made me smile long after I had finished the novel. Cassandra Clare may actually have written the best Epilogue and ending to a series I have ever read. I was so unsure going in to this book, I was afraid that everything would fall apart and no one would get their happy ending. This book, while it takes you through and emotional roller coaster, is eventually happy and it left me feeling hopeful. I am more then happy to discuss spoilers in the comments so if you are worried about spoilers please refrain from reading the comments!
A sweet, lovely historical romance holiday anthology. A Very Scandalous Holiday was a lovely collection of holiday romances. I really enjoyed reading them all. Erins Gift was a very sweet story. Erin was a likable heroine who was genuinely nice. Seth was a sweet hero who didnt want to fall in love, but fell anyway. The romance was sweet, with a touch of spice and the story was lovely. An Eternity of You was a reunion between two lovers. Or, kind of. Rebecca was a strong heroine who went through a lot of tough times that have made her bitter. But, despite her resentment for her circumstances, she knew when to forgive. I thought she was great. Andrew was a hero who thought he was doing the right thing by leaving Rebecca. He didnt think his family would allow them to marry, so he left before he could ruin her, or so he thought. He didnt realize that a dream he had while he was ill and Rebecca was tending to him was actually real. And, the consequences of that, though he didnt know about them, were real. He was a sweet hero. He might have made mistakes, but he always loved Rebecca and was determined to make things right. The romance was sweet and lovely. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was perfect. Letters at Christmas was a story about a second chance. Sidony was a lovely heroine who unsure if she should trust again. I really liked her. Hale was a hero who never stopped loving Sidony, but was uncertain if she would forgive him. The romance was both sweet and steamy. I really enjoyed the story and the happy ending was wonderful. This one was my favorite of the stories in this anthology. Eight Tiny Flames was a sweet love story about two people who fall in love under the most difficult of circumstances: in a WWII battlefield, trying to celebrate Hanukkah while the antiSemitic Nazis marched ever closer. Ruth was a feisty heroine that was very likable. She was strong and proved herself a worthy heroine as she held her own in a battle front. Joseph was a dedicated soldier who slowly came out of his shell as he fell in love with Ruth. He was adorable. The romance was sweet and lovely. I enjoyed the story and the ending was lovely. A Very Scandalous Holiday was a fantastic historical romance holiday anthology. All of the stories were sweet and wonderful. If you want a lovely read that will get you ready for the holiday season, this is a book youll want to check out. I received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review
I continued my read along with TLCReadAlong by reading Scarlet in pretty much only two days! It was so good! I cant wait to read Cress and Fairest this month, in anticipation of Winter coming out next month. I gave Scarlet 5 out of 5 stars. In this book, were introduced to a whole new cast of characters. Most of the characters from the first book are barely seen, if theyre seen at all. I really liked Scarlet, Wolf, and Thorne. Thorne was a little full of himself, Wolf was a bit creepy read the book and youll understand why, and Scarlet was a little stubbornhotheaded, but thats what makes them so believable and likable in my opinion. Really, Id take any of the main guys as a book boyfriend. Kai, Wolf, and Thorne are all awesome in their own way. I read pretty much 23 of the book in one day because I couldnt put it down. The characters were engaging, the action was enticing, and the suspense kept me on edge. Ive heard that the series gets better with each book, and I have to agree so far. Scarlet was more amazing than Cinder, which I wasnt sure was possible. Marissa Meyer does an amazing job hooking her readers and pulling them into the story. A 450 page book would usually take me quite some time to read, but I flew through it. The whole series is based on fairy tale retellings. In this book were supposed to see some of the Red Riding Hood fairy tale, and we definitely do. A red hoodie, Grandma is missing, traveling through the woods, wolves, etc. I also liked how the author put phrases from the fairy tales to start the different sections books within the novel. I didnt mark down any of my favorite lines because I was too busy devouring the book. But once again, like with Cinder, I kind of guessed what was going on. But there definitely were some twisty parts I didnt see coming too. The ending of the book makes you want to pick up the next book and see Cinder, Scarlet, and the boys figuring out what to do next, how to survive while on the run, how to defeat Levana. Final note: An amazing second book to the series! I cant wait to read Cress and Fairest this month. Check out the series if you havent already. Im positive you wont regret it!
I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review. You dont tie yourself to something unless youre scared you might float away. Emma Blair meets her first love in high school. The connection is instant. It is felt deep within the pages of their story. They fall easily. As if they were meant to be. Soul mates. Its no surprise that they marry and embark on a life that only a young couple in love could do. They inspire each other. Their love is simply timeless. When tragedy strikes and Jesse goes missing, Emma is left devastated. Lost. Her heart simply feels dead. She is numb. Overcome with grief, she picks herself up and moves back home. A place she told Jesse she never felt like she belonged. Little did she know that fate had something else in mind. When you love someone, it seeps out of everything you do, it bleeds into everything you say... When Sam reenters Emmas life she is still mourning the loss of Jesse. But Sam? He makes things a little lighter. He numbs the pain. Makes it easier to breathe. Soon enough she falls for Sam and his beautiful soul. If there was anyone that could be the definition of a selfless love, it would be Sam. One day, years after Jesses death, Emma gets news that he was found. Alive. And Jesse is ready to come home to the only love hes ever known. How does Emma choose? Is that even possible? What do you do when loving two people means breaking hearts? Ill never ask you to tell me Im your one true love. I know for someone like you, that isnt fair. And Ill never ask it. This is my first book by this author, but definitely not my last. I did have some issues with the pacing and I wanted to feel the tug of hearts between these three a little deeper. I thought it was just at the surface and I yearned for a bit more. Nevertheless, the story was thought provoking, well written and a testament to whether we can ever have one true love. The declarations of love within this book are beautiful, heartbreaking, and overwhelming. Profound even. I was moved by these characters and their strength. Without giving anything away, you will fall in love with Jesse and Sam. They both love Emma deeply and unconditionally. And the author allows you to feel that love. I recommend reading this beautifully honest and genuine love story. Think of all the people in the world. And I was lucky enough to find you twice.
When I was trying to decide on the last book I wanted to read for 2014, I knew I wanted to read something really great. So with high hopes I picked up Snow Like Ashes by Sara Raasch. Id heard so many great things about the book, so I was hoping it would be just what I was looking for. And I boy was it!! Snow Like Ashes has earned as spot as one of my favorite reads of 2014! The main character in the story, Meira, was very well written. Ive seen some people compare her to a young Xena: Warrior Princess, and thats pretty much how I imagined her as well. She was strong and determined; willing to do what she needed to do for her people. She wants nothing more than to see her Kingdom once again restored to power, and freedom for her fellow Winterians. Through all the things that she went through in the story, she stayed strong and proved herself to be a really great character, and a fierce warrior. The secondary characters were well written as well. I especially loved Sir, Mather  Theron. There is a bit of romance in the book, but its not overpowering in a way that it takes away from the storyline. It felt like there was meant to be a love triangle as well, but it really didnt feel that way to me the more I read the book. It felt like one half of the triangle were two people who were really comfortable with each other because theyd never really known anyone else. And the other half of the triangle is a new relationship that I am really going to enjoy watching grow in the future. Hopefully. Another thing that had me completely hooked when reading this book was the action. There was never really a dull moment in this book, and all the suspense and surprising plot twists kept me turning the pages well into the night. And let me tell you, there are some super surprising twists in this story, including a few that had me pumping my fist into the air in joy! Also, the worldbuilding was super creative; I could easily imagine in my mind all of the kingdoms as they were described in the book. My favorite kingdom would have definitely been Winter! How wonderful this place sounds. Overall; If youve read a hundred reviews already that said this book was awesome, then mine is just another to add to the list. This book definitely closed out my year with a bang, and Im so glad to have read this as my last read of 2014. If you havent read the book yet, or added it to your toread list, I implore you to do so. You definitely wont be disappointed! Happy Reading!
4.5 stars. This review was originally posted on my blog, Hiver et Cafe I received an ARC of this book through a giveaway. This does not affect my opinion in the least and this review is my complete honest opinion. I think with fantasy, especially those like Red Queen, where there is a society that is oppressive and horrible and unhappy, the book is about the spark of the revolution. The change that is about to happen and how it comes about. The way this book is written gives me a sense of dread and foreboding, waiting for something bad to happen. Specifically, for people to find out that Mare is not a silver and that she is really a red. The entire book felt like I was just waiting for this bad thing to happen. The world is built very well and though its simple in the concept of silver blood and red blood, it has a well built societal structure. You can tell with the way that the reds are organized and how the silvers live their way of life. We also get some mentions of the world outside of the main country and the different kingdoms that also have red blood and silver blood. The powers are interesting as well. We get to see the special powers best in the aristocratic silver houses, where each house has a hereditary power passed down paternally. Im still a little unsure if its the same for the silvers outside the royal houses though, as most of the contact with the silvers is through the royal houses. We really get to see Mare develop and change from the red thief to the pretend silver princess. We get to see her thoughts and demeanor evolve and adapt to her situation. We can see her try and compartmentalize her feelings into manageable chunks so that she can cope with the decisions that she makes and will have to make. I dont know which of the brothers I like best yet. Cal, the crown prince, is the soldier. He is better at fighting and using his body. He is kind in a way that is most convenient for him in order to keep the legacy of his father and himself. He sees all that goes into oppressing the reds and though he wants to help them, he doesnt want to be the king that destroys his kingdom over a revolution. Maven is the younger prince, Mares betrothed. He is the politician. He is more sly and a thinker rather than a fighter. He is worse than his older brother in fighting but he understands the subtleties that go into being a leader and facing the politics of the other nobles. His actions, to me, were unexpected, but not unwelcome. However, because he is the more sly and smarter of the two brothers and the son of his mother, Queen Elara, I cant help but distrust him. The big gasp moment did happen eventually at about 90 into the book. It didnt shock me as much as to be expected, I suppose, as I was just waiting for something to happen. Red Queen is a really great fantasy world with out too much complexity. The writing was really great and I really enjoyed the repetition of some lines to emphasize ideas.
You can see this full review and more at Book Briefs:  do you talk about a book that just shattered all of your expectations in the most unexpected ways? I feel like quoting big brother while reviewing The 5th Wave, saying expect the unexpected. This book felt totally new to me and, I think that was what I loved most about it. I decided to pick up this series because a lot of exciting things are happening surrounding it this year. The first book is being made into a movie, which releases in January and the final book, The Last Star, is coming out on May 24, 2016 so I thought now was the perfect time to finally read the trilogy. And I have to say, I cant wait for the movie! The 5th Wave is the first book in a young adult dystopian trilogy by Rick Yancey. It tells the crazy story of 5 waves that hit the earth, each one more terrifying and different than the last. Ill tell you snippets of each of the first four waves, but the 5th one is something you will have to read the book to experience. click the spoiler to read teasers of each of the waves I dont really give much away though so it should be pretty safe to read even if you have not yet read the book. 1 E.M.P blast that took out all forms of technology. 2 A worldwide earthquake 3 An airborne Ebola virus 4 Aliens! trained to kill humans assassin style! There is a lot going on all at once in the 5th wave. But I have to say Rick Yancey does a terrific job dealing with the chaos and still making it easy for the reader to follow the story. Cassie and Evan, the two main characters were great. Cassies narrative was unique and completely fit with the choas of the story all around her. And Evan, well I just have to know what is going to happen with him in the next book. The author leaves you hanging at the end of this book, but like I pointed out earlier you have the movie and second book to tide you over. Fans of young adult Dystopian and of thriller books with a darker edge to them need to read The 5th Wave series. I am kicking myself that it took me this long to read them.

As part of Monsterfest 2013, I decided to tour some book monster classics as well as films. I was finishing up Stokers Dracula and decided to research the Dracula of werewolf stories. Most sources pointed to Stevensons Jekyll  Hyde but I did find a reference to this one by Guy Endore, billed as THE classic werewolf novel. The book relates the tragic tale of Bertrand who inherits the curse of lycanthropy from a corrupted priest in his family tree. His stepfather notices his sinister secret as he enters adolescence and attempts to stem the tide by locking him away in his bedroom. As you can expect, he makes several successful escapes, resulting in the expected werewolf mayhem and chaos. Eventually, he escapes, attacks  kills another young man from his village, forcing him to flee to the relative anonymity of Paris. In Paris, he joins the army and seeks to control his primitive urges, finding solace in an idealistic love affair with a local noblemans daughter. His stepfather, feeling responsibility for not stopping the werewolf when he had the chance, follows Bertrand to Paris with full intentions of stopping him. On the whole, the book is an interesting read though it lacks the punch, suspense, pacing, and creative style of Stoker. Bertrand is meant to draw the readers sympathy for his tragic plight but he is a little two dimensional to really draw you in. The werewolf mayhem is not as well written as the creepy passages in Stoker, limiting the scare factor of this novel. Likewise, it is a little light on the typical trappings of the werewolf legend turning under the full moon, silver bullets, wolfsbane, etc.. He also drops into a completely out of place discussion and storyline involving the Paris Commune and the Communards that is very distracting to the principle tale. The book does have its moments. You can see some influence from both Stoker and Leroux in terms of trying to give the story authenticity. The narrator purports to be a researcher, seeking clues and evidence for the story of Bertrand from eyewitness accounts and journals. The section dealing with his adolescence and Bertrands relationship with this stepfather is also pretty compelling, especially the evening hunts for Bertrand in wolf form. The biggest drawback is the denouement that never quite comes together. Worth a look but still hope to find a true classic for this monster.
The Wrath  The Dawn will suck you in and have you in tears by the final pages. Plot: Okay so call me late in the game, but I didnt know about the fantastic tale that is A Thousand and One Nights until about 5 years ago but I wish I had grown up with it so that I could understand all of the nuances in Ahdiehs tale. The Wrath  The Dawn is exquisitely written with a prose that will keep you flipping pages. To be quite honest, I didnt know if I wanted to give The Wrath  The Dawn the full five stars because there wasnt much depth to the world or the characters. It wasnt until about halfway through the book that I became wholly invested and my husband had to pry the book out of my hands and force me to go to sleep. It was hard man. I do believe that my tiny qualms with this book will be resolved by the second installment. Characters: One things for sure, Renee Ahdieh can write badass females. Shazi is fearless and does not back down to a challenge. Her bravery is evident in the fact that she has planned to murder the king but thats just the tip of the iceberg. I appreciated her ferocity and it was interesting to see how she and Khalid moved together. I liken this romance much to that of Cruel Beauty. Khalid willingly refers to himself as a monster and Shazi is not perfect in her own right. The two of them are imperfect but clearly perfect for each other which made their love so fragile and unique. While the secondary characters didnt get much love in terms of growth, they definitely played a part in the overall conflict and it was a surprise to see how everything fell together in the end. World Building: You mean a book that isnt set in the United States or some fantasy world where only white people dwell? YES PLEASE. Even though there wasnt much to descriptors about the land, I very much felt like I was in the desert and with Ahdiehs handy glossary, I was better able to picture to people and their world. Short N Sweet: The Wrath  The Dawn is a beautiful story about two people who find love in the most unusual situation. If I were to nitpick, I would ask for more characterization, even this, this book left me breathless.
Im a few days late on writing this review, but I think I just needed some time to gather up my emotions. Wow, this series. Winter was definitely one of the most satisfying conclusions to a series Ive ever read. Almost everything you look for in a conclusion it was there. So much happened in this book, and although I still wanted to see some other things happened at the end of the novel, I still felt like it was enough. This book was by no doubt my second favorite in the quartet my first being cress and I found myself being able to tolerate more characters that I didnt necessarily care for much before cough cough Scarlet. There was nothing slow about it; once we were about 100 pages in we hit the ground running. Winters parallel to Snow White was so amazing, and half way through the book, I realized that the Seven Dwarves were Cinder, Kai, Cress, Thorne, Scarlet, Wolf, and Iko, and of course, the huntsmanprince was Jacin. The dwarves thing though was really clever, and idk if it actually was them, but I though it was very clever of Marissa Meyer to allow an incorporation like that. The only problem I did seem to have with this novel was Scarlet. I know many think of Scarlet and Wolfs relationship to be sweet, and I dont mean to offend anyone with my opinion, but they were just so cheesy and not for me. Scarlet herself had some problems within the book that actually made me say I really hate you at her while I was reading. Just to get this out of the way, I love Winter. I love the way she is portrayed, and I love that she abstains from using her Lunar gift, even though it drives her mentally insane. Winter literally has a mental illness, and Scarlet refused to understand that about Winter. Every single time Winter had a hallucination, Scarlet was just like oh, get over it, and she could not comprehend the severity of Winters issue. Scarlet refuses to see Winter as a person suffering from a mental illness and treats her really cruelly, in my opinion. Things like, Winter, I know youre used to batting your eyelashes at everyone who walks by and expecting them to fall in love with you, but thats not going to happen here., like wow, youre a BITCH. Scarlet had no patience for Scarlet, which is ironic because she would seem like the person who would know how to be patient and understanding after all thats happened with her grandma. And not only that, but Scarlet refuses to understand it altogether. At the end of the novel, Scarlet still didnt apologize for how she reacted towards Winter, and I just felt that to be so problematic. Other than my problems with Scarlet though, this book was fabulous.
After finished The Winners Curse and not having all the feels that everyone else did, I felt like a bit of a pariah. I was lucky enough to get an ARC of The Winners Curse, so I decided to continue with the story. I was so glad that I did continue with the series because I really enjoyed The Winners Curse. Likes: This book gave me the feels. I really felt for Kestrel and Arin. What a horrible situation. The sacrifices you make for love, oh man. It was just so unfair. Plus, I really felt bad for the prince to just be stuck in the middle of the whole thing. No one was happy and no one was getting what they wanted. Everyone was lying and pretending, all of the same reasons, without realizing it. If there has ever been a character I want to see die in the most painful way, it is the emperor. Argh, I was so frustrated by him throughout the whole book. I just wanted to see him get his just dessert, hopefully sometime soon. Arin made me swoon in this book. I can imagine how Kestrels heart just raced and pulsed when he came to her at the ball. It would have to be so hard to avoid his advance and not want to throw in the towel just to be with him, even if it meant both of them giving up everything. I really wanted this one to be a movie. I could just imagine what the around Arin looked like when he went to speak with the Queen. I envisioned a whole Game of Thrones situation with Khalessi. I would have loved to get a story from the Queens POV too. Maybe there will be a novella. Gripes: Sometimes Kestrel was just so immature. I know that she just turned 18, but there was a few times in the book where I felt like she was throwing a temper tantrum. I just kinda wanted to smack her and be like, look, you made these choices; you have the knowledge and intelligence, figure it out. I so badly wanted someone to tell the truth. I was almost screaming at my book, Just go to tell, just tell him the truth. Phooey  I guess it will just make me continue with the series. For more reviews visit A Flurry of Ponderings
It seems like it was just yesterday oh wait, it was yesterday that I was writing my review for All the Bright Places, complaining about how much I dislike reading about suicidal teens and all the angst. But then, I read We Are the Ants and reminded myself of why I read so much YA, including this more realistic  contemporary genre. Oh sure, our protagonist Henry is known in his high school as Space Boy because of his frequent alien abductions, but dont let the aliens fool you. This is the real deal. The premise is bizarre. Henry doesnt fit in at his school. His classmates torment him, and hes all alone since his boyfriend Jesse committed suicide last year. And his and Jesses mutual best gal friend Audrey vanished and ditched him right after Jesses suicide and they seem to be blaming each other, and themselves. Hes been hooking up with a popular boy, who refuses to be seen in public with him and bullies him in front of the popular crowd. Oh Henry. His home life isnt much better. His dad took off several years ago, his grandma is losing her faculties to Alzheimers and manages to ruin any of the familys attempts at cooking, his brother dropped out of college because hes working for his pregnant girlfriends dad, trying to save some money for the coming baby, and his mom is coping with this plus her crappy job as a waitress by drinking lots. And then there are the aliens, who show up when Henry is alone and take him up to their spaceship, and later drop him off pantsless, naturally somewhere embarrassing around town. The aliens ask Henry if he wants to push a shiny red button which will save the world from certain destruction in just over 2 months time. And Henry doesnt know. Oh Henry. And then, one day in science class, Henrys favorite class because yeay science and also a supportive teacher, a new student shows up. One who is new to town, with a mysterious past. Ive said enough about the plot, as it is actually important in this book, unlike so many YA books where the plot is just there, as set dressing for the many flirty scenes and quotable dialogue. Not this book. The plot matters. Things happen. Real things that people have to deal with. And Henry needs to decide  is this world worth saving, worth living in? The audiobook is also quite decently done.
Lex malla, lex nulla. A bad law is no law. Where should I begin from? The plot was very good, eventful and gripping. From the beginning to the very end, I was hooked. The book had many references from The Mortal Instruments, though I was not annoyed by it, but it just somehow slowed my pace because I had to pause every time it was something about JaceClary or MagnusAlec in order to comprehend it. I never thought that I should read TMI, no specific reason, but now I might read it because these characters seem interesting especially Alec and Magnus. Okay, now, lets talk about characters from this book because there are a handful of them that I loved. First of them all is Emma. Oh I just loved that girl. She is so sassy and reckless and she loves blackthorns like they are her own family. I just love that she is not afraid of Clave, she breaks the rules but she is not that proudbrat female character who thinks of herself as some goddess. Nobody calls me blondie and keeps their kneecaps.  Emma. Well, Emma, make sure anybody who calls you that shouldnt keep any part of their body intact. The next character that I love is... Julian. Surprise, surprise! Honestly, how one cannot love Julian? And who do not love Julian? Give me the names of those people so I can feed them to my fish I dont have a fish but I can get one for this sole purpose, right Emma?. That guy is very definition of sweet, kind, affectionate, gentle, humble and what NOT! The way he takes care of his four younger siblings, even of Mark who is elder than him, makes my heart melt. He was just 12 when he began playing a role of a father and a mother. 12! At that age, all my elder brother did was practice WWE moves on me. Julian just deserves the world. And then Mark happened. That poor guy got through so much, alone, in the Hunt with Fair Folk. He was adorable, with the way he talked and his reactions when he didnt get references of the modern world. He surely made me smile with the stupid things he did. He bumped into a pay phone and said, Excuse me, miss, on our way in, said Julian. Its polite to apologize, said Mark with the same small voice. Not to inanimate objects. Christina, Ty, Livvy, Dru and that small goofball Tavvy are equally loved by me. PerfectDeigo and Kieran were just fine. Now lets talk about some pairings: Emma and Julian: THE OTP. They will be the endgame Im 200 sure. There will be hearts broken but Cassie will mend them. I have faith in Cassie please, dont shatter it. Christina and Emma: BEST FRIENDS!! Christina and PerfectDiego: NOT so perfect. Mark and Kieran: I dont care. Mark and Christina: Yes, Yes, YES!! Ty and Kit: TheSherlock Ty will find his Watson in Kit. Write it folks; they are going to be a THING! And I will love that very much.
After reading Uprooted for the second time this year, I still stand firmly behind my opinion that this novel is one of the best that Ive read in the genre. This isnt one of your innocent YA fantasies which are basically some ridiculous love triangle with a hint of something that resembles fantasy worldbuilding. It has length, the author has given much effort to worldbuilding and the magic system, theres a typical medieval setting with a bonus of blood, gore and scary stuff. The only thing that I wouldve appreciated more would be a map at the beginning to show us the true size of the corrupted Wood. Perhaps it was in editions other than the one I had. The thing that I enjoyed the most was that the motivation our heroine for acting was her love for her best friend and her drive to save her. Agnieszka isnt perfect and she admits to being jealous of Kasia. She isnt a typical main character that cant make mistakes. She makes them often but she takes the blame. The author borrows a lot of her ideas from Slavic folklore, which isnt very common in fiction. Other than vampires, the creatures from Slavic mythology arent very popular. Here we have a different version of the old story of Baba Yaga, which is usually depicted as a fearsome witch with chicken legs and iron teeth, but instead, she is a powerful forest witch who helps people and whose spells and charms have a homely feel. Also, the names of all of the characters are Polish. Being Slavic myself, its a refreshing sight after reading many western novels that have mostly Anglophone names and mythology. Other than that, the writing style is very fluent and easy to read even though the fact that the author used the word vomited more than I was comfortable with; I really hate that word and I wasnt able to notice any major plot holes. The characters were very lovable, if not relatable because there isnt a lot of character growth. The romantic relationship between Sarkan and Agnieszka wasnt explored enough. It felt like the author added it to the story just because it was expected, as this is a retelling of the classic Beauty and the beast in a way, and not because she wanted them to fall in love. There will be a film adaptation of Uprooted in the years to come and it will be produced by Ellen DeGeneres, which is pretty exciting.
So this is a series I heard a lot about and have been wanting to read for a while. I know its a super popular series so I was excited when my friend and I decided we would buddy read this. It ended up being a lot more enjoyable than I was expecting. Ive already read Scarlet so a review of that will be up in a couple days. So I have to say Cinder was a great retelling of Cinderella. I was sucked into the story right away. Every time I would read this I didnt want to put the book down. Thankfully I was loyal to my buddy and I did my best not to read ahead. I know some people were saying that they found this book predictable. After finishing the book I could see how but it was something I just didnt catch onto. I am happy I didnt see the ending coming. I am a little upset with myself for missing it though. This made the story more enjoyable though. Another thing I really enjoyed was the main character. I really loved Cinder. I really liked that she was a mechanic. I liked that spin on Cinderella. I also really enjoyed that she had a good relationship with one of her stepsisters. I know in the movie Cinderella both her stepsisters didnt like her so that was a nice little surprise. Cinder was very caring and smart. I enjoyed that there ended up being a lot more to her and you slowly discovered it as the story went on. Another thing I really enjoyed is that this was written in different perspectives. I always enjoy getting different characters perspectives. I feel it makes the story a lot more interesting and you get to see what things are happening one place and happening in another. Its also nice to get the different characters views about certain situations. I always feel like that was a plus. In this story you get to see the perspective of Cinder and of the prince. They both were had a lot on their plate to deal with so it was nice going back and forth between the two characters. Overall, I really enjoyed this story. I ended up being hooked right away. I did not see that ending coming so it made the story even more enjoyable. I was dying to know what was going to happen next so I had to pick up Scarlet. I will have a review of Scarlet in the next couple days. I highly recommend you check this out if youre into retellings and scifi. It was a super interesting combination.
 ARC provided by author in exchange for honest review  5 Bombshell Stars Wow...GUNS was just PERFECT to conclude and tie in the Rook and Ronin series and spin offs. If you dont know who Rook, Ronin, Ford, Ashleigh, Spencer and Veronica are, then what are you waiting for. I highly recommend you do because you do not want to miss out on the madness, craziness, sexy romance, and wild ride this TEAM takes you on. Guns is not a standalone and you MUST read all of the books of the series first. This book is Spencers story but he ties in what crazy mess the TEAM has to deal with. Ms. Huss perfectly titled her book, GUNS because let me tell you this book is blazing with sexiness, humor, and action packed suspense. The TEAM is back and in full swing. Ronin is the Liar, Ford is the Hacker, and Spencer is the Security. Spencer Shrike is the tattooed biker and owner of Shrikes bike. He loves his friends and family but there is one other person he loves the most... His Bombshell, Veronica Vaughn. Spencer and Veronica have history. He loves her but due to circumstances hes been distancing away from her. She doesnt know why until Spencer tells her that hes a bad guy. Hes done bad things and doesnt want to taint her by being associated with the Team. He wants to protect her at all cost even if it means being a jerk and distancing himself from her. Veronica tries to move on but she cant help being drawn back to Spencer. These two have this chemistry and history that they cant escape. She loves him and will do anything for Spencer. The sexually chemistry of Veronica and Spencer are through the roofs. This couple is just hot. They balance each other out. She knows him and he knows Ronnie through and through. He can see through any facade and walls his Bombshell puts up. Gah...I just love this couple!! Without giving much away to the storyline, GUNS and all the books associated with Rook and Ronin series is a MUST READ!!! All you need to know, there is going to be trial and Rook must testify. Ford is overly protective of his wife, Ashleigh and their baby, Kate. Theres someone new to town who has his eyes on Veronica. Spencer wants his bombshell. And lastly, there is someone who is targeting the Team so strap on and prepare yourself for this crazy wild ride the gang will take you on. Yes, you heard me I highly recommend this book and series. You do not want to miss out on knowing Rook, Ronin, Ford, Ashleigh, Spencer, and Veronica. As for the epilogue, it was just PERFECT. Whats not to love when there is HEA for everyone! I love these group of characters and thank you Ms. Huss for introducing us to the TEAM. J.A. Huss
I have a confession, Im in awe of Colleen Hoover. Everything she writes is gold. I really dont know how she does it. Ive been a fan from the beginning, reading Slammed a few years ago I was blown away by Colleens ability to suck me into her stories. She hasnt disappointed me yet. Confess is just as amazing, just as well thought out as her other books. What she may lack in discipline she more than makes up for in her in her plots. Ive definitely seen growth in her writing. The more she believes in herself the more well see it in her writing. So much untapped potential and I only see great things in her future. I dont know how to describe Confess. Its so much more than a romance. In real life people come with baggage, they come with secrets, and they come with the willingness to love. Most of the time. Life isnt perfect. We think we know what were doing but then someone steps into our lives and things...change. Were redirected and turned around, left trying to figure it all out. Whats right for us and where are we going? There are people you meet that you get to know, and then there are people you meet that you already know. Auburn thinks she knows where her life direction is. She has a goal. Theres no room for distractions, namely men. Meeting Owen wasnt planned. This is the beauty in Colleens writing, she takes us to places we didnt know we needed to go. Pushes her characters outside their own boxes. Owens art gallery is like him, unique, different, and deeply emotional. He paints peoples confessions. I was intrigued and excited to see how she incorporated them into a story that ends up coming full circle in the most unusual way. The ideas in Colleens head are masterpieces. The incorporation of art, confessions and the written word, is sublime. Im scared Ill never feel this again with anyone else, I whisper. He squeezes my hands. Im scared you will. For once I wish I could read a CoHo book WITHOUT crying. But dang it if she doesnt get me every single time. The prologue geez, my kids were laughing at me when I told them it was the prologue. My teenage daughter snickered. She may as well have pointed and called me a loser. But that prologue yo. Only CoHo. So get ready to have your world rocked CoHo style. Confess is about love, loss, lies, hurt, friendship, family, forgiveness, and confessions. A copy of this book was kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review
5  Wandering  Stars  I loved how special this story was  how different it was. I loved Finchs sense of humor and the way he sees the world. This story was bittersweet, because it was lovable but it broke my heart into little pieces. The story begins the way with Theodore Finch  whom everybody sees just a weirdo and an outcast despite that he plays the guitar and plays in bands, and he is pretty cool  standing in the clock tower of the school and thinks: Is today a good day to die?. But then he suddenly recognizes that he is not alone. In the other side of the tower stands a girl, Violet Markey whom he knows from the Geography class. Finch  who thinks maybe this is not the best day to die and this is not the prettiest way either  makes Violet to leave the tower with him with charm and humour. Finally the news spread at the school that Violet saved Finch. Because Violet doesnt want anybody to learn why she was in the tower at the first place unfortunately she lost her sister in a car accident, and that day would be her birthday, and she feels that she owes Finch. Partly this is the reason that she agrees that to make pairs with Finch during the Geography project: they have to visit at least three places in Indiana, and they have to write down what they saw. Everybody visits museums and boring places but because Finch sees the word another way he collects a lot of interesting places where he wants to see for example the Worlds Largest Ball of Paint, or the highest point of Indiana. Because since the accident Violent doesnt sit in a car  ever , firstly they have to go by foot or by bike, so their options are limited. They run out of places pretty soon and Finch finally gets Violet to get in a car, and they make road trips to the chosen places. Finally he helps Violet to find a way from the darkness and he teaches her to live again. This was a wonderful and compelling story, and it was humorous and lovable. I found the writing style of the book similar as John Greens. Maybe if I got it without a cover, I blindly would said that it is a John Green book. I close my review with the words of the author, which is the perfect way to show you what this story was like. For more of my reviews please visit my blog:  
I have a feeling that theres going to be many more fairy tale retellings in my future... Cinder is a modern retelling of Cinderella. I grew up on Disney and I still remember watching this when I was little. Actually I think Im going to go watch it in a little bit just because I loved Cinder so much. Going into this book I wasnt really sure what to expect. I just expected it to be good because Id heard so many good things about it. Im so glad I read it! The characters, the story, and the writing were all amazing. The book only lost points when I predicted the end on page 44. In fact I found the book very predictable. It made the ending less of a surprise for me but overall the book was really good. Cinder was a great character. She wasnt weak and boring like Luce and Beth some other characters Ive read about. She was interesting and funny and cyborg. Im pretty sure this is the first book Ive read about a cyborg and I have to say that Cinder was simply a great character. She was also a mechanic. How many people have read a book other than this one about a cyborg mechanic? Anyone? Well I havent. The other characters in the book were perfect too. The evil Lunar queen, stepmother, and stepsister made the book that much more enjoyable. Just so you know I tend to like the villains in the book and I definitely liked the villains in the book. They were just such great villains that I just had to like them but I also hated them at the same time because well they were the villains. I also loved Iko and Peony she was Cinders other stepsister. They were Cinders only friends and what happened to Peony broke my heart. So the story was great but very predictable. Id be able to predict something way before it happened. It sort of ruined the story for me because I wasnt as surprised as I would have been if I hadnt been able to guess what would happen. I absolutely loved Prince Kai and Cinders relationship with him. It was cute and Kai was just plain awesome. That last part of the book was intense but I dont want to ruin it so Im not going to say anymore. So if youre not sure if you should read this then just ask yourself the following questions: Diddo you like Cinderella? Do you want to read about a cyborg mechanic? If you answered yes to those questions then I suggest you go pick up this book and read it!
Ah, I am madly in love with this series! Something Ive noticed with trilogies is the middle one is kind of a let down compared to the first and last. Its usually more filler than anything else, and generally isnt as fun as the others are. We see a bit of that here, with the jumping ahead months at a time and just seeing Clara slog through her days, but it still really set up for the next book as well as piggy backed on the first. We learn more about Angel Bloods. We learn more about Clara and her family. It really is a book of its own and thats something Ive had trouble finding in the second of trilogies, so it was a wonderful change. Im a little annoyed with the pushing of Christian and Claras relationship. What Clara and Tucker had was so wonderful, and completely real. Their relationship grew naturally as a healthy relationship should. It was wonderful. A great change from most YA Ive read. Now its Christian and Clara are fated to be together so it must be so. Even though Clara and Tucker are so great together. I dont really care much about relationships in books unless they play an important role in the plotand wont point them out unless theres something seriously wrong with them. See Open Minds But here its taking a great relationship, something younger readers can look at and actually aspire to have, and throwing it out the window just for fate. I do hope this is plot relevant or I will be very disappointed. I love the little twist with Claras mom. I had narrowed the new vision down to two suspects a bit before Clara did and it was the same two she came up with, but there was still that mystery there because you didnt know who was in the vision and it just worked really well. Im not sure how I feel about Claras father showing up and being who he is. I kind of liked book one Clara with her being mostly human and really just your average girl who happened to have a bit of angel blood in her, but this is character development and her coming to terms with who she really is, and facing destiny, and its really important. Im glad we got to learn a bit about hr brothers purpose. I mean I kept wondering why all the focus was on Clara when clearly her brother should be going through the same thing. We also get a look at insider angel life, which is something I was super curious about. Even if its just a tiny sneak peek, Im so happy it was there. And finally, Samjeeza. Hes great because hes not exactly an enemy, but everyone treats him as one. He really has potential for a great antagonist, but at the same time can possibly be a powerful ally and I love that. I cant wait to pick up book three!
10 FOREVER ALWAYS TO INFINITY STARS ARC Generously Provided by Author As I stared at Rune, I asked myself how I had gotten so lucky. I was loved by this boy, loved so fiercely that other loves paled in comparison. I closed my eyes and replayed our lives in my mind. I remembered the times I hugged him and he hugged me harder. I remembered how I kissed him and he kissed me deeper. And best of all, I remembered how I would love him and he would always strive to love me more. Where do I begin to describe this incredible story??? Firstly, Id like to give Tillie Cole a BILLION GIRL KISSES for creating the most beautiful love story I have read....EVER!!! Id like to follow that up by stating that I also have a bone to pick with her because how can anything I read after this measure up!!??? I seriously dont think its possible! This, in my honest opinion, is Tillie Coles MASTERPIECE . She has always been one of my top favorite authors, but after having read this GORGEOUS  HEARTBREAKING story, Tillie has definitely earned her place as my 1 FAVORITE AUTHOR! I knew even before I read this book that it was YA, and I dont have anything against this genre, but I mostly read NA and Adult Contemporary books. That being said, I think those of you who tend to steer clear from YA really need to forego that stance and pick this one up ASAP! Rune and Poppy are two of the most endearing and wonderful characters you will ever come across in your reading adventures. Their love for each other was so awe inspiring and it will make you wish that a love like this could come into your lives. Tillies writing is beyond exquisite. I highlighted so much of this book and found it so hard to pick just one quote to add to my review. There were some quotes that were so breathtaking but to post them here, would possibly spoil the story and you definitely need to go into this one blind. If I could shout it from the rooftops I would say  Drop whatever book you are reading and pick this one up!! Make sure you have a box of tissues handy because the tears will start freely flowing!! Also download the song If I Could Fly by One Direction. It is mentioned in the book and it gave me goosebumps while I was reading this amazing book. This is definitely my FAVORITE Tillie Cole creation and this story is one I will carry in my heart for a long time to come. BEST OF 2016! BEST BOOK EVER!!!
Okay so I am giving this book 3.75 stars. Now dont hate me if you thought this book was wonderful! I thought it was pretty close. I just think my overall excitement throughout reading this book was too up and down to give this book 4 or 5 stars. Here are my thoughts: Plot: I thought the plot of this story was well thought out. It was like one of those stories where every few chapters you pick up puzzle pieces that you keep putting together till you see the full picture at the end. Then even when you see the full picture, you find out that even more puzzle pieces can be added to the edges, but you wont get those till the next book so youre stuck with all these new questions. I dont know if that made any sense, but thats how this book felt to me. Even though I liked the puzzletype plot of this book, I still do not think I enjoyed much of the first half or 34 maybe. We did spend most of the time in Meiras POV and there were parts spent in each kingdom that were really really good and then parts that I was like.. Maybe I can just put this down and make a sandwich because I felt my mind not being grasped by the story anymore. Its because of this reason that I just feel wrong giving this book 4 stars. Compared to book one, which had a lot of action and sarcasm and cleverness, book two was more focused on politics and describing the kingdoms and the people in the kingdoms. Though I did like the world building. Sara Raasch does an amazing job creating a certain ambiance and environment for each kingdom. What really sucked me into this book was the ending. Oh GOODNESS was the ending so wonderful. The last hundred pages or so had me immersed until I finished. Warning: MAJOR PLOT TWIST  CLIFF HANGER at the end, unless youre much better than me at guessing things. Characters: Two things: I love Ceridwen, hate the royalty except Ceridwen, and changed ships. I shipped Meira and Theron in book one. Now, I definitely do NOT at all. At the moment I dont completely hate Theron, but stuff happens and now I either was Meira to be alone in the end or with Mather. A much more indepth review is on my blog if you want to check it out!

Dangerous creatures, wallflowers. Approach them with the utmost caution. They sit quietly in corners, appearing abandoned and forlorn, when in truth theyre sirens who lure men to their downfall. You wont even notice the moment she steals the heart right out of your body  and then its hers for good. A wallflower never gives your heart back. The first ever historical romance novel Ive ever read was Devil In Winter. And its really amazing that the book that made me read this genre again after more than a year was Devil In Spring. This book has the combined vibe of LKs Wallflower series and the Hathaway series. Pandora Ravenel is very lovable, smart and quirky. Gabriel St. Vincent is a very handsome, swoonworthy hero who has a hard and strong exterior but has a very soft and loving heart. Hes tolerant, dependable, responsible and a romantic, though he only shows it when hes with Pandora. Good God, she really did walk in circles. A pang of tenderness centered in Gabriels chest like an ache. He wanted all her circles to lead back to him. Am I staring? Forgive me. Its only that I adore the way you laugh. But what really made me fall hard for Gabriel was the story about the fox cubs he took care of as a child. That scene really made me cry and wish that there is really someone like him in real life. I think for Gabriel, the most difficult part of raising them was having to keep his distance, no matter how he loved them. No petting or cuddling, or even giving them names. They couldnt lose their fear of humans, or they wouldnt survive. As the gamekeeper told him, he might as well murder them if he made them tame. It tortured Gabriel, he wanted to hold them so badly. Poor boy. Yes. But when Gabriel finally let them go, they scampered away and were able to live freely and hunt for themselves. It was a good lesson for him to learn. What was the lesson? Not to love something he knew he would lose? No, Pandora. He learned how to love them without changing them. To let them be what they were meant to be. Another reason why this book is different from the other historical romance novels Ive read was that the time frame of this story is set when a transition of culture is already happening in England. This is set in the time when women is already starting to believe that they have so much more worth than being a wife of somebody. This book is about the birth of feminism, given that Pandora originally didnt want to get married because she wanted to become a businesswoman and there was a female doctor in this book when at that time, men didnt trust women to do great things in different fields other than household keeping. Good job Lisa Kleypas! This is why I love you. 3
Reviewed by: Hello Beautiful Book Blog Colleen Hoover has written her most powerful novel yet. In this book, nothing is black and white. The experience It Ends With Us gave me was unforgettable and changed my perception of looking in from the outside. This is a book people need to read. There is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes do bad things. This review is probably going to be pretty short because I refuse to give any details as far as the plot. This book is one you MUST go into blind. I finally understand why Colleen said to start the book that way. Getting to go through everything with Lily was an unforgettable experience. You have to experience everything alongside Lily. You have to be her and find yourself wondering what just happened and what is going on. I promise you, if you read spoilers it will take away from your experience of reading this book for the first time. Youre really beautiful when youre happy. You will find that everything is not as black and white as you once thought. There are more shades of grey than are found in Mr. Greys closet. I found myself wanting to apologize to people I had once judged. This book is an eye opener. I love that so many people are understanding the message. It is a wonderful thing. The raw emotion that Hoover puts on the page makes this book so special. I would encourage everyone to read this, but especially if you are a woman. Naked truths arent always pretty. Lily as a main character was wonderful. She is driven and passionate. She is strong despite her weaknesses. She was a joy to read. I loved Lily and her strength. As every CoHo book has, there were some amazing secondary characters! Allysa and Marshall were hilarious and such good friends to Lily. Other characters who make a short appearance are also hilarious and provide some good comic relief. I always end up loving the side characters almost as much as the main characters in her books. Hoover can make them so real. In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me. If you have read this book I urge you to join the discussion group on Facebook, but not until youve read it. There are so many telling their stories and I am loving the empowerment and understanding this book is bringing forth. Make sure you read the author note after finishing the book. That was one of my favorite parts. CoHo has done it again. I love this woman. It has to end with us. Be that girl, Lily. Brave and bold.  I finally understand why Colleen said to go in blind. Getting to go through everything with Lily was an unforgettable experience. All I have to say is read this now. Nothing is black and white.  Its here! I wont be getting much work done today because It Ends With Us is taking over my life! I cant believe its finally here! Is that my heart cracking already?
Wow. In the Afterlight was absolutely amazing, a wonderful and action packed end to one of the best YA adventuredystopianscifi trilogies Ive ever read, and was such an emotional read. Before I started, I reread The Darkest Minds and Never Fade to get back into the mindset and enjoy the beginnings all over again. I was terrified that The Darkest Minds wouldnt live up to my previous hype in my mind, but it was just as amazing the third time around. I was anxious to start In the Afterlight and eager to see where the story would go. It amazes me how much can happen inside of the pages. The books have never felt like there were enough pages for all of the things that happened or had to happen, but somehow, it all fit. It also amazes me how much I love Ruby and Liam, yet the book never puts their relationship on center stage, which is rare for any YA book and I loved that. I think I fell in love with everyone for who they were and grew to love every one of their quirks. I care so much about the characters in the series. But faced with the kind of world they were living in, the characters ignored their own wants in order to do the right thing all of the time. Ruby sacrificed so much in order to lead and be a better example, and sometimes denied herself the things she wanted most because she felt like she owed it to others to focus on something else. And with the only other Oranges being terrible, she fought hard to prevent ever being like either of them. I cannot praise the trilogy enough. In the Afterlight was perhaps the best book in the trilogy because we finally got to see Ruby accept herself and quit fighting her own nature. However, The Darkest Minds might remain my favorite because of the nostalgia of Black Betty and the four friends on the road and I think perhaps thats the feeling every one of the characters tries to hold onto. There were so many jaw dropping moments in the book. There was so much hanging in the balance, so many hard choices to be made, and so much conflict. It was an incredible journey and I couldnt believe how it ended. It was absolutely perfect. It made me cry, which is pretty rare in the first place. Ive never read any kind of dystopian or scifi novel and cried, but thats how much I connected with the characters. I dont understand how this series isnt more popular. Its one of the best YA trilogies out there and I think its incredibly underrated. I cant wait to see more of the authors works in the future and The Darkest Minds trilogy will definitely be one I reread over and over again. Its one of the few series Ive read through NetGalley and loved so much that I went out and got a hardcover because I had to own the finished copy.
This and other reviews on my blog My Friends Are Fiction My Thoughts: I had some high expectations going into Uprooted. All the early reviews were fantastic and its been optioned for a film...so lets just say this book had a LOT to live up to. And, thankfully, it did. I adored the writing, characters and story. Im not entirely sure of what classification this book fits intoyoung adult or adult, but I felt that the pacing and overall feel was more adult but would be easily accessible to a young adult reader as well. Uprooted is a standalone so we get the entire story packed into one book which is always nice for a change of pace. I must admit though, Im greedy and do wish there would be a sequel. I think I might have enjoyed the story even more if it could have spread over two books. I felt like some of the character interactions would have benefited from being longer and more drawn out. The characters were fabulous especially the Dragon. He was the perfect mixture of mysterious, inaccessible yet caring. I felt like him and Agnieszka had incredible dialog and chemistry. I was so sad though that we didnt have more scenes of them together see I am greedy. The side characters were strong as well and everyone felt well rounded to me. One of my favorite elements of Uprooted was the scary Wood. It seems like many fairy tales always have the scary wood but rarely do we really get the full scope of what caused it to be that way or an adequate description of the forest. In this book the wood was such an entity and felt like a character. I was fairly creeped out by the imagery and was incredibly impressed with how creative Novik was in her describing the wood dwelling creatures. Novik did a masterful job of incorporating fairytale elements into her story and the feel of this book felt very reminiscent of Grimms fairy tales. Theres this nice descript on Goodreads, ...introduces a bold new world rooted in folk stories and legends, as elemental as a Grimm fairy tale thats incredibly accurate concerning this book. Final Thoughts: Bottom line I loved the writing, story and I had legit swoons though Id hoped for a tiny bit more development for the relationship. Expect to be mesmerized by the world and to fall in love with the characters...just dont expect to have enough scenes between the main leads
Plot Ill Meet You There was a cute contemporary romance. Josh Mitchell has returned to his hometown after getting injured in the Marines and Skylar is trying with all of her might to get out of their hometown and away to art school. She just has to work through the summer and shes outuntil her mother loses her job and starts spiraling. Suddenly, Skylar has to make the choice of whether to pursue her dreams or to stay. Ill Meet You There was not only an amazing romance, but also a heartwarming story about a girl struggling to realize her dreams and a boy whose dreams were shattered. This book gave me so many feels, something that hasnt been happening much with the books Ive read. Leading Lady Skylar was an amazing female lead. She was compassionate and determined. She wanted to get out of her hometown but was willing to stay in order to help her mother. I really enjoyed Skys character because she was real. She had her ups and downs but she didnt give up. She was friendly and loyal to her friends, her family, and others in her community. And yet, she refused to settle for less than she deserved. Leading Male Josh was lost. He was angry and sad that his way out of their town had been lost. Josh was a very deep and very layered charactermany things from the war he lost his leg in had happened and emotionally scarred him. Like Skylar, Josh felt real. We wasnt tough as nails like youd see another veteranhe was shattered and I loved seeing him as vulnerable. He had his problems and his strengths. Both of their characters were very dynamic and personal. I enjoyed reading Joshs POVs just as much as I enjoyed reading Skylars. They were so different yet so similar and their distinct voices made for a very touching read. Romance The romance in this novel was absolutely beautiful. Youd think that it wouldnt work outSkylar was intent on getting out and Josh was stuck in the town that they were both trying to escape. Skylar was a goody twoshoes and Josh was an angry veteran. And despite these things, they meshed incredibly well. Their relationship was sweet and based off of emotions rather than attraction, which made their relationship all the more real are we sensing a pattern here? Other Characters The final thing that I adored about this novel was the complex secondary characters, specifically Dylan, Chris, and Marge. Marge was Skys boss and became a symbolic mother figure for Sky, helping to guide her through her emotional troubles and concerns throughout the novel. Dylan was a teenaged mom who was fine with staying in their hometown. Although her and Sky wanted different things, they didnt really let that get in the way of their friendship. And Chris wanted to get out just as much as Sky. Although he wasnt my favorite of secondary characters due to a few things that he does and says in the novel, you could tell that Skys relationship with her friends was genuine. Conclusion A heartwarming and sweet story about two characters finally growing into themselves, Ill Meet You There levels out as one of my favorite contemporaries this year. I havent read any other Heather Demetrios novels, but I will definitely be checking them out. If this book is any indication, Demetrios is an author you dont want to miss.
First I was kind of on the fence about this book, but because everyone was raving about it and how good it was, I decided to pick it up. And boy am I glad that I did! The world is amazing, the story line is amazing and the characters are even more amazing! First of The world this story takes place in, is so unique. I didnt read The Grisha Trilogy, which takes place in the same world, but that whole world feels so old and unique. I could imagine Tim Burton making this into a movie. I think that would be amazing. I love that its based on The Netherlands in the old days. Im Dutch, so I love that! I also loved reading all the Dutch words and names. I think that gives it a little something something extra for us Dutchies reading it. Than there is the storyline This storyline is on point! Its so exciting and thrilling, you cant put the book down. And I love that the world is so unique and full of magic and than there is this storyline which feels very modern  contemporary. I love the mix of those two things. I also liked the humor in the story, it was a bit sarcastic which I love. The characters in the story are so smart, so youre constantly thrown in a different direction. Which definitely keeps you on your toes and it keeps the story fast paced. The only thing I liked about the ending, is the fact that there is going to be a sequel. And I cant wait for it. Last but definitely not least, the characters! Om my gosh they are amazing, every single one of them. Even the characters that only have a small part in the story feel like big characters. The six main characters, I cant even. I want to be a part of their squad even though they are all criminals, I dont care. We get to know them better during the story and they grow and change in the story as well. Kaz reminded me a bit of Neal Caffrey in White Collar, only Kaz is a bit more violent than Neal was. I love the interactions and flirting between the characters. One of my favorite quotes was: My ghost will not associate with you ghost. And of course No mourners, no funerals. So al in al a beautiful world, awesome storyline and even more amazing characters!
Its really hard to write about this book... The worst decision I made was, when I decided to read this book at work. Ok, I was listening an audiobook version, but my emotions was the same. I bet some of you had situation like me : sitting at work ,reading or listening book and trying really hard , not to show emotions. And I failed. Like a lot. Cause my coworker next to me saw me and she was like She is totally bitch... And you know what I did? yes I did.... Book was AMAZING! Why? 1.I laughed Headline? he asked. Swing Set Needs Home, I said. Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home, he said. Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks the Butts of Children, I said. Tell me my copy is missing the last twenty pages or something. Hazel Grace, tell me I have not reached the end of this book. OH MY GOD DO THEY GET MARRIED OR NOT OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS?! 2. I wish I would have such amazing friends! But I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world without him. Maam, Augustus said, nodding toward her, Your daughters car has just been deservingly egged by a blind man. Please close the door and go back inside or well be forced to call the police. 3. Strong , fatal, breathtaking love. I will not tell you our love story, becauselike all real love storiesit will die with us,as it should. As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. Im in love with you, he said quietly. Augustus, I said. I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. Im in love with you, and Im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. Im in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have, and I am in love with you. I wont say anything else , cause if you want to understand something about this book , you just have to read it. It would be worthless to search answers in my or others review. Of all my read books, I read only 4 books with similar endings, because I want happy endings. But even in books shit happens. AND I DONT REGRET NOT ONE MINUTE EVEN THOUGH I STILL CRY
Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes. Where to begin with this book? I dont know. Nothing could have prepared me for how this book turned out. I seriously struggled reading this book. I was so clueless as to how it will end. Plus, the fact that it hit too much to home made me cry endless tears. There were moments I wanted to stop reading because I couldnt take anymore of it but I wanted to know everything and anything that would happen. Needless to say, everything was unexpected. Personally, if I would have known that this is what the book is about, I would have stopped myself from reading it. Believe it or not, I went into this sort of blind because I trust the author so much that I dont need anyone to do a pep talk and sell it to me. Nevertheless, this is one of the best books I have read this year. I fell deeply in love with every character. And to see each and every one of them some parts of me in some way made me finish it in one sitting. Naked truth? I can actually relate to Lily. I have experienced what she has experienced. There were some differences but most of them, yeah I have seen andwitnessed. Not only that, I can probably say that Im a victim too. I absolutely love Lily Bloom, shes one of the most courageous characters I have ever read about. It takes so much strength to love someone and end up hurting both yourself and that someone to stop being a statistic. I admire the fact that I also see a bit of my mom in her and when I grow up, I want to be like them. I applaud Colleen Hoover by writing this book. It takes absolute guts and bravery to write something so close and deep from your heart backed up by experience. I mean, this is one of the best authors I know as far as Im concerned. Her last two books still made me cry but they were a bit safe and werent this heavy. I now know where shes coming from when she said that it was difficult for her to write this book because reading it tore me up in a thousand pieces. Someone once told me that there is no such thing as bad people. Were all just people who sometimes do bad things. There is so much more I want to talk about from this book, the complexities, the love, hurt, friendship, strength and much much more. I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know. It it absolutely one of the most remarkable books I have ever read. Just keep swimming 5 BEAUTIFUL STARS!!!
I was a little skeptical going into this book. There was so much hype around it, and I was worried that it was not going to live up to its hype. I am happy to say that it definitely lived up to its hype. There were somethings that I didnt love about the book, but as a whole, I loved this book! The plot of this book was so intriguing and addictive. It was one of the most unique plot lines that I have read in a very long time. I was completely absorbed by the story. I wanted to figure out what was happening just as much as the main characters did. This book definitely got my heart racing so many times. I also really enjoyed the setting of this book. I thought the space setting was so interesting and unique. I havent read very many books where the setting is on a space ship a majority of the book. The format of this book is like nothing I have read before. The visuals that are used in this book were really interesting, and I thought it was a creative way to make this book unique. However, sometimes I felt like it took away from the book in a negative way. I thought some of the articles were boring to read, and I wish those would have been cut out. I would have liked to have more narrative at times instead of the crazy visuals. They sometimes took me out of the story because I was trying to understand the visual. Essentially, I just wish there would have been more actual narrative instead of the pictures that were used. I loved the two main characters of this book, Kady and Ezra. Kady was smart, sassy, and fearless. I thought she was extremely admirable, and I wish I could be more like her. My favorite parts of this book were when Kady and Ezra would instant message each other. I loved their relationship, and I shipped them so hard. I thought Ezra was the perfect match for Kady. He was romantic, funny, realistic, witty, and protective. He made me laugh out loud and swoon numerous times through out the book. The relationship between Ezra and Kady was the main reason I was so addicted to this book. I wanted them together so badly! I actually wish they would have a little more interaction in the book, but I was still pleased with what I got. Overall, I really enjoyed this book! I definitely think a lot of people will love this book, and it will live up to the hype for a lot of people. If you like scifi books, then I would definitely recommend you check this book out! I will say that I think this book would be easier to read in a physical copy instead of ebook due to the visuals in the book. If you are thinking about reading this book, then I think you definitely should! It was an enjoyable book that I think a lot of people will fall in love with. 4  5 Fangs This ebook was given to me in exchange for an honest review. MrsLeifs Two Fangs About It Facebook
Brief summary With a mother thats schizophrenic and a sister that is paralyzed, Penryn is in charge of keeping her family safe after the angel apocalypse. When her family comes across an angel, Raffe, being attacked by others of his kind, Penryn tries to help Raffe defend himself and her little sister is kidnapped in the process. In order to find her sister, she has to learn how to trust one of the very creatures who destroyed her world. What I liked This was a really good book. I read this in a day and I honestly cant remember the last time I read a book this fast. It was really hard to put down. The plot moves very fast and the characters are excellent. Penryn has every reason to be hard and angry, but she isnt. Shes a very strong, kickass character who faces her fears and fights like hell for her family. Raffe is hard to read at first, but as the story progresses he becomes a little easier to understand. I really would have liked to read some chapters from his POV. I really want to know what was going on inside of his head. The romance in this book is very slow to build, but I absolutely loved that about it. I could see how their relationship progressed throughout the book, instead of the instalove andor feelings surge that so many other books have. The relationship between them developed nicely and is very well written. This setting is pretty much how Id picture a world were angels have caused mass destruction. Gangs are everywhere, food is scarce, people are wary of trusting each other and there is a group of people forming a resistance. This world is very dark and there are things much more frightening and disturbing than the angels. What I didnt like Things got a little strange for me towards the end. When Penryn finally finds Paige, things started to get kind of weird. The way Paige is described had me picturing a very creepy voodoo doll. Plus there are creatures in tanks that are very scifialien like. I normally wouldnt have a problem with this, but there is so much else going on in the novel that I kind of felt like it was overkill. Hopefully this part of the story will be explainedtied in better in the next book. This is the only reason this book gets 4.5 stars from me instead of 5. Brief thoughts I finished this book in one day, so its definitely a really good read and one that I would absolutely recommend. Just make sure you dont have anything planned for the day because this one is hard to put down. : You can find this and more of my reviews on my blog
