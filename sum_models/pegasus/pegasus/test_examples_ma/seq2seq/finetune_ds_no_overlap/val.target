What do you think when you hear of a book thats just been released that was highly anticipated, and already has a goodreads rating of 4.22 after just a few days?? I automatically think GROAN.... A hyped up book that young people are reading and getting obsessed about, too good to be true, Ill hate it... Well in this instance I am thoroughly thankful that I was wrong, and will gladly eat my slice of delicious humble pie. I havent read such a wonderful book in a long time. The empire has taken over the land and has forced its inhabitants into submission. When Laias brother, the last person alive whom she holds dear in this world, is kidnapped by a vicious masked warrior, she manages to flee and track down a bunch of resistant fighters. They make a deal with her that in return for them helping her brother, she has to be a spy for them in the military academy, gathering information from the commander of the academy, the greatest masked soldier who has ever lived, and who is an absolutely evil saddistic bitch. The story is told by Laia, and also Elias, a masked soldier who is about to graduate from the academy. Now dont let my poorly written brief synopsis of this book turn you off it. It is one of the most gripping books I have read. One of those books that you just cant stop reading and then you find yourself looking at the time and its 3am! I loved the characters. I was fearful that the characters were going to be your typical YA annoying characters that drive you batty with their incredibly stupid behaviour and dumb choices. So I was absolutely refreshed when I discovered that all of the characters had an awesome depth to them that I wasnt expecting. Sure, there was a love triangle... Two love triangles in fact... But they were well written and actually fit the story really well. I didnt cringe once and it didnt put me off in the slightest as I was so invested in the characters. The world and atmosphere that Tahir has created is mesmerising and terrifying. I cant really make an accurate comparison in my mind to any other books, but think Throne of Glass meets Game of thrones both of which I enjoyed but much more enjoyable. I am also anticipating this book to be BIG, and would be extremely surprised if it doesnt get the hype like such series as the hunger games or divergent etc. And well deserved too. Loved it! Now Ill leave you with a quote that took my breath away... Life is made of so many moments that mean nothing. Then one day, a single moment comes along to define every second that comes after.
I heart this book! What a CUTE book. From the very beginning, Stephanie Perkins catches your attention and then holds it for the remainder of the book. I started this book only 4 hours ago, and I could not put it down until I reached the very end. And what a sweet sweet ending it was. Anna is such a great character, shes very well rounded, and develops brilliantly throughout the book. Watching her progress through the chapters was so endearing, and makes you root for her the whole way through. Etienne is incredibly sexy in how he is portrayed, and no one could blame Anna for falling for him and being so irresistibly attracted to him from the beginning. It was amazing watching their growing attraction to each other, but also very irritating at parts. The secondary characters were also great, Perkins was able to tap into different types of teen psyches so well that it makes you feel for each and every one of them. And she wrote this book in such a way, that it makes it very easy for you to imagine it being made into a feature film, and a good one with a good plot at that. I loved the Paris descriptions. The language, the little ins and outs of the city, all the things that make Paris so wonderfully French! It made me want to be there, to go there, to study there, to live there. My absolutely most favourite part of the book was how enchanted Anna was with NotreDame. The reason I loved it so much was because I remembered when I first saw the cathedral for myself and how breathtaking it was to see it up close and personal, and how absolutely taken by it I was. It was the most beautiful thing ever, and the most beautiful setting to Victor Hugos story, and seeing it live is such a great experience. Reading about it, and having Perkins put it into words like that was great, because she was able to catch its magic perfectly. All in all, this was an amazing book, a story told so brilliantly about a girl who was forced into independency and leaving her parents home a little too early. But one that managed to beat the odds and fought her way through and came out the winner at the end. Id definitely see myself reading this again in the future, but I also know that I cant wait for Perkins next novel coming out in September.
FINALLY!!!! We finally get all the answers to all the secrets between the Weavers and the Hawks! And it couldnt have ended much better! This was it. The Final Debt. Cut pushed my shoulders forward. A heavy yoke settled over the top of my spine. I closed my eyes. I said my goodbye. ... I waited to die. Holy shit! What an ending! This was the sixth and final book in the Indebted series. It was utterly perfect in the way it was so imperfect. Nila was such a strong, brave woman. I hated I had the power to save the man I loved by obeying the man I hated. Jethro finally accepted himself for who he is. I wasnt like my family. I was unique. I was me. And Id never been more fucking grateful. We learned more about Cut, Daniel, Kes and Bonnie. I loved how we got a few chapters in other characters pointofview. It really made the story complete! There were so many answers revealed, and yet more secrets came up. I really dont know what else to say other than read this book and this entire series. It is dark, twisted, and fuckedup, yet I couldnt put it down. It was sick, sad, sweet, and full of love. I loved every minute of it. I cant wait to read the epilogue and learn even more of the future.  Tiffany, 5 stars  When I read a book for review, I tend to need a few days to sit on what I read before I can go back and write the review... This book, I HAD to write the review, NOW! So, if I sound a bit like a hyper five year old, I apologize now. This book is perfect. It is not a perfect love story, a perfect romance, or a perfect anything you would normally read... It is so far from perfect, it makes it just thatperfect. In the conclusion to this series, we get a lot of answers that have been hanging in the balance since the beginning. We get a better look at some of the characters who may have puzzled us, and we get closure on the characters that we never got. I would recommend this book and series to ANYONE who is looking for a story that will blow your mind and obliterate your idea of a perfect romance. While the scenarios the characters are in will never be ones you are faced with, you are able to insert yourself into the story and understand where the characters are coming from, and the decisions they have made. Kite, while imperfect, is one of my favorite male leads of all time and I dont think you will find a better man to be the one for fill the role in the series. And my message to the author... You have made a fan for life from the first book to the last. Thank you for being twisted enough to put this story on paper and make me fall in love.  Devlynn, 5 Motherloving stars
I am completely loving the opportunity to follow Jennifer McQuistons publishing journey: the third title in this Second Sons series is as enjoyable as the first two, and there is the added bonus of getting to catch glimpses of characters highlighted in earlier works as they appear in this story. Julianne was a memorable guest at a house party at the Earl of Havershams estate, particularly after she named Patrick, the earls son as the murderer of his brother Erik. When the earl suddenly dies, Julianne heads to Morag Scotland to track Patrick down to inform him of his inheritance. Patrick, for his part, wanted nothing to do with the earldom or society: after convincing his father to support his veterinary studies in Turin, he returned to England expecting to set up a practice. While that dream was not supported: men of the Ton do NOT work in trades, he still kept his hand in the field within his fathers stables. When the potential for him to be arrested and charged with his brothers murder was feeling eminent, he fled to Morag Scotland: and has been serving as the local veterinarian for the town, scraping by as he waited for his father to clear his name. Julianne was an interesting character: a touch flighty but determined and despite thoughts to the contrary, quite intelligent. While dancing the fine line of propriety as a young, unmarried woman, her unchaperoned carriage journey via public conveyance to Scotland to hunt down a man she barely knew would bring her utter disgrace. The two have an unmistakable chemistry, from their first encounter nearly a year earlier to the forced proximity of their situation: although they are often at crosspurposes with the secrets that they have, and the preconceived notions about each other. Yet, someone did murder Erik, and the Earls decline was far too rapid for anyones comfort. This story is less lighthearted than the earlier works in the series, but the characters truly do come to light and life throughout the myriad of twists and turns to find the one or ones responsible for the two deaths. With clever asides of veterinary treatment and a three legged doggie companion, a victim of a coach for hire, and the obvious affection between Julianne and her father as well as Patrick and his sisters and mother, the story will have you wondering who did it, and hoping that the truth would come out before a trip to the gallows becomes the solution. McQuistons stories are emotionfilled with a solid sense of characters, place and time: always giving at least one dislikable character set to provide conflict and dissent among those who are destined to be together, even when they dont see it. I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via Edelweiss for purpose of honest review with Tasty Book Tours. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.
The beginning was a bit slow for me but afterwards I did not want to put my kindle down. We meet Cath whos our main character. She hates change. Her life revolves around her twin sister Wren and their father. Lets not forget Simon Snow think Harry Potter. Cath and Wren are about to start college, much to Caths dismay Wren doesnt want to be roommates in college. Forcing Cath to live with a complete stranger. There was a boy in her room. Totally not the roommate situation Cath was expecting. Fortunately, the boy in her room is her roommates friend Levi. Reagan is Caths roommate; shes not exactly a friendly. Shes a bit rough around the edges but she grows on you throughout the book. Cath is an English major and basically goes to and from class, like she doesnt even know where the cafeteria is and lives off cereal bars and peanut butter. She spends most of her time writing fanfic of Simon Snow. The eighth book of Simon Snow is out soon so Cath spends most of her time writing her own book eight of Simon Snow titled Carry One, Simon. Throughout the book we watch Cath slowly break out of her shell thanks to Reagan and Liv. Her relationship with Wren slowly drifts apart. Wren turns into a party girl while Cath stays true to herself. Although Cath and Wren had a falling out, Cath and Levi had a falling in. Oh Levi, Oh Sweet Levi. I loved the fact that it wasnt a love at first sight situation nor was it based off pure looks. It was about personality! The relationship grows and develops SLOWLY unlike many books these days. It was a breath of fresh air to see a real relationship blossom from friends to more without focusing on the physical aspect of the relationship. It was about studying, talking, and actually getting to know one another. What I loved about the book besides the romance was that I could relate to Cath so much. I was pretty much like Cath minus Simon Snow. I hate change. I literally would go to class and then go home, never talking to anyone, never taking chances. I also had a couple times when I decided I wanted to quit but stuck it out. I was also an English major because I loved to write but I stopped writing completely. It was like rereading my college years. Aside from that, I thought Rainbow Rowell did really well wrapping up the story. The characters were relatable and likable. THE ROMANCE WAS ADORABLE! If you havent picked up Fangirl yet please do then stop by my blog or twitter so we can gush over Levi. Yeah?
Im scared Ill never feel this again with anyone else. I whisper. He squeezes my hands. Im scared you will. LOVED IT! I went into this looking for something light and fun, but this is my third Colleen Hoover book and I should have known better. This was one stressful book! But I loved it to pieces and like usual, could not put it down. Theres just something about her writing that is so captivating and addicting, so hard to put it down and so easy to fly through! Such beautiful writing and story.. The idea of this story with the confessions was so interesting and the fact that these were real peoples confessions is just breath taking, especially when we could see the picture that the confession goes with. In case youre confused, this story follows Auburn and Owen and Owen is the artist of a place called Confess. People anonymously drop off a confession and then he uses those confessions to inspire his artwork. Auburn walks into his studio and they fall fast for each other. The connection they feel for one another is so strong and so sweet. I dont want to give too much away because its more fun to let the story unfold as you go but I will say that this love story is complicated and heartbreaking but of course we had our ridiculously cute and fun moments too! There are some people you meet that you get to know, and then there are people you meet that you already know. The issues in this book are so REAL and Colleen Hoovers characters are always so so realistic that even when I was frustrated with Auburn, I understood her. Towards the end though she started to drive me crazy! But the whole ending of this book and the growth of her and the story was so fantastic. The development was really good and the ending of this was heart stopping! This book made me sad, aggravated, stressed and happy in between. Then the ending was a huge punch in the feels. The way the past and the present intertwined really made the story even more powerful. Such a beautiful and extraordinary love story. You really can never go wrong with a Colleen Hoover book! I love you so much. His voice is breathless and full of fear. Ill love you forever. Even when I cant. My tears fall harder at his words. And Ill love you forever. Even when I shouldnt.
I loved HALFBLOOD so when I saw that Jennifer had another book coming out I went to check it out. I wasnt quite sure what I would think of the book but from my previous experience with not jumping on HALFBLOOD when it first got here then kicking myself later for not reading it sooner I knew I should read OBSIDIAN no matter what. I was not disappointing. Katy and her Mom move from Florida to West Virginia to get a new start after her father died. She wasnt very excited to be there but decided she would give the neighbor kids a shot and introduce herself. So imagine her surprise when a super hot guy answers the door and he proceeds to be a complete and udder ss to her. Thankfully his sister Dee who she meets later is really nice and they hit it off. She doesnt understand why Daemon and his friends hate her so much but she is determined to keep Dee as her friend. I LOVED that Katy is a blogger, I thought it was super fun to read about her blog posts and her geeking out with her in the mail videos. It made me laugh to hear her talk about her blog and how she missed it when she couldnt get one of her posts up. Katy was really easy to like. She is really independent and did a great job of sticking up for herself when all she wanted to do at some points is break down. No matter how much of a jerk Daemon was he was also a strong likable character. You get to know him even through his mood swings and get to see how protective and loving he is int he way he treats his sister. The romantic tension between Daemon and Katy made me laugh and cry at times. The emotions all around were real and high. I cant wait for more development on their relationship. The storyline was really unique and exciting. I loved learning about Daemon and Dee and who they really were. The whole idea of them was imaginative and well explained. Im really excited to learn more about them and their future. There was nothing about OBSIDIAN that I didnt like. I would recommend that you go buy it and read it now but be warned that you will be dying to get your hands on book 2.
Scarlet was definitely high up on my list of things to read in 2013, because I loved Cinder last year. The covers of these are simply marvelous, and I cant wait for Cress to come out next year, which apparently will feature Rapunzel. Ive said it before and Ill say it again: Marissa Meyer is one of the most creative authors ever. The new twists on such classic fairy tales make them feel almost new again; I really enjoy the quotes throughout the book from the real stores, especially the first one  She did not know that the wolf was a wicked sort of animal, and she was not afraid of him. Honestly, I was pretty miffed when I found out that this book would center on Scarlet rather than Cinder  Im always annoyed when narrators change, though I know I shouldnt be. Cinder was in the book maybe only a little less than Scarlet was. I was happy to discover that I loved all the new characters  Scarlet, Wolf, and Thorne. I was very interested in seeing how Scarlet fit into the story and how her path would cross with Cinders. I definitely loved Wolf most of all. I had such a hard time figuring him out in the beginning of the book  he was supposedly a street fighter, but he was also rather shy and almost timid at times. I realize his and Scarlets relationship moved rather quickly, but this was one of those times where I didnt mind so much. The sequel to Cinder might as well be the Queen of Point Of Views. It switches so often its not even funny. It bounces from Scarlet, to Thorne, to Cinder, to Kai, to Wolf, and even once to Queen Lavana. And while this would normally be extremely irritating, Meyer somehow makes it works, makes all their perspectives worthwhile. I know a lot of people are upset with Kai for the decision he made towards the end of the novel. I was, too, but at the same time I understood why he did it. He really didnt have any other choice, and my heart was breaking for him every time we checked back in with him in the story. The only thing about this book I didnt like, and Im not even sure if this is a valid complaint, is that there is literally SO many things going on that you really have to focus to remember and understand it all. I may have to revisit this review in the future and add things because I cant remember everything I wanted to mention. Im really looking forward the the next two books in the series, and I hate that I have to wait until 2014. 5 stars.
Make way for the Raven King. I dont know how to compartmentalize my thoughts and feelings right now. I am sad and happy and confused and so filled with love for this series and its beautifully flawed and wonderful characters. It hurts, it hurts so badly I dont know how to even begin to explain it. Not just pals. Friends. Blood brothers. You just feel it. We instead of you and me. Thats jeong. I guess, depending on where you begin the story, it was always about friendship: unbreakable bonds and unconditional love. These group of friends trying to find their place in the world, and figuring out how to be something more. There is a strange kind of magic in that. What a strange constellation they all were. Blue. Gansey. Noah. Ronan. Adam. Henry. My beautiful children. I am so proud of all of them. Adam smiled cheerily. Ronan would start wars and burn cities for that true smile, elastic and amiable. Adam Parrish especially, his last scene in the novel was so emotional and perfect and I am so happy about all that hes overcome. Ive said this once but Ill be happy to say it again, I am in love with Maggie Stiefvaters writing. The parallelism and repetition that she uses to start her chapters just adds so much more intensity and emotion to the scenes. I love it. I am in love with all of it. five stars for Noah Czerny. I loved his story arc so much. When his sister came and spoke during Raven Day? I was sobbing. We learn about Noah when he was alive; this energetic and creative and beautiful skateboarding boy. No wonder Ronans the one who makes him feel alive. The fact that they will never truly know Noah is so absolutely heartbreaking it physically hurts. And comparing how large my love for him is to how little he really was in these books just goes to show how wonderful of a writer I think Maggie Stiefvater is. I am just extremely depressed that he wasnt at all mention in the epilogue. I know none of them know that hes the one who started Ganseys search for Glendower, but it still hurts so much. I love Noah Czerny, he is my heart and soul. Tell me, Artemus whispered, when you dream do you dream of stars? There are of course things left out in the open, and things I am not exactly sure about, but in a series that so filled with the idea of dream versus reality, and the wonder of magic, it feels almost fitting. I will always be happy for more though. He was a book, and he was holding his final pages, and he wanted to get to the end to find out how it went, and he didnt want it to be over.
Divergent is a book that I read after a million positive reviews about it. I had to see for myself what this book was all about. I can admit freely here that I read this book in two days. I could not drag myself away from it until it had ended. I cant say for sure that I have ever read a dystopian novel, so I knew it would be a bit different than a lot of the stuff Ive been reading lately fantasy and vampire stuff. Anyhow, in this book when the boys and girls turn sixteen, they must choose if they want to stay with their faction or transfer to another faction. The factions are Candor the honest, Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Amity the peaceful, and Erudite the intelligent. Beatrice ends up leaving her family and switching factions. She chooses to join the Dauntless faction. After the choosing ceremony she is changes her name to Tris and is thrust into a brutal initiation several weeks long. Really, the Dauntless initiation is awful. But, in the long run Tris who is small and appears weak, does end up getting stronger and tougher. When we meet Four, one of the instructors for the Dauntless initiates, you know right away that there is going to be something between him and Tris. This is one thing I dont agree about all the other reviews. In many reviews I have read about this book, everyone is like Oh I love Four I just dont get that, hes not really any thing that special and he isnt even really that humorous or anything. He was there for Tris when she needed him to be though, and that counts for something and he is tough. So, throughout the training Tris begins to suspect that something bigger is going on than normal Dauntless initiation. It seems that the factions are fighting against each other there are other clues that lead her to think that things arent right. In this novel, the government and way of life is far different than how we live now. Its crazy to read about this stuff and think about how it would be if thats how we lived. I can easily see this book being made into a movie, it is brimming with action and action is what always makes a good movie. I really liked Tris as a character. Im drawn to characters who grow right before our eyes and go from being kinda weak to being a real heroine. Well, thats what I thought. Im a big fan of not putting up spoilers so Ill leave it at that.
I have been surrounded by love letters you two have built each other for years, encased in tents. Woah. This book has left me utterly speechless. Well, not speechless enough to where Im not able to write a full length review, which this book fully deserves. But can we just talk about how beautiful the yore above is ?? Thats just one example of the gorgeous writing that is in this book. The Night Circus is without a doubt the most mysterious and enchanting book that I have ever read. A lot of that has to do with the writing style, which was beautiful. The Night Circus manages to transport you to a completely different world and leave you breathless, never wanting to leave. Well, at least thats the effect that this book had on me. I cannot even begin to describe the atmosphere of this book, which is interesting because the atmosphere is one of the main reasons why I loved this book so much. Its a very dark, mysterious atmosphere, but it is still beautiful and enchanting. The world was beautifully crafted, as was the circus itself. The circus was insanely intricate and mysterious and I cannot imagine the amount of planning that went into creating The Night Circus. The descriptions of the Circus were absolutely magical and I could not get enough of them. The way that this book was written made the circus itself feel like a character. Another thing that I could not get enough of were Baileys Chapters. Surprisingly, I found myself a little more invested in Bailey, Poppet, and Widgets lives rather than Celia and Marcos. I cant quite tell why, but I felt very connected to Bailey, Poppet, and Widget, which is why I enjoyed their chapters so much and why they are by far my favorite characters. Another thing that I found incredibly unique about this book was that there were short chapters that were written in second person POV, which made it feel like you were actually at the circus experiencing it with all the other characters. The chapters in the book also frequently switched between different characters and different time periods, which was a tad bit confusing at times. The only complaint that I have for this book was that the first third of it was a little slow, and that the stakes for Celia and Marco werent that high even though they were in the midst of a magical competition. I also feel as if the romance between Marco and Celia was not the main focus of the book, but more of a background thing, despite the premise of the book making it seem like their romance would be the main focus. This complaint however was completely forgotten whenever I got the the second half of the book which was considerably more fast paced and intense, and the romance between Celia and Marco truly flushed out and became one of my favorite fictional romances. All in all this is a wonderful read and I am left wanting even more from this world and these characters. I would love a full book about Bailey, Poppet, and Widget. I will be thinking about this book for a long time. You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of your words. This is your role, this is our gift.
Grave Mercy was a surprise book. I probably wouldnt have read this book if not for Netgalley. But Im so glad I did read it! It was quite an intriguing story with memorable characters. And honestly, I was a little surprised at how much I liked it. I wasnt expecting a lot from it, except for the nun assassins part, which I thought was pretty awesome before I read the book, but then I started reading it, and whoosh! I was sucked into the story, living in the intrigue, feeling the magic. LaFevers did a good job at concocting up an interesting plot with originality and excitement. I liked the mystery, and how it was executed, slowly built, with little twists to keep you guessing. It kept the level of intrigue high, and kept my interest, and I couldnt wait to see how it ended. There was a lot of court intrigue, and at first was a little too overwhelming. Too many names and little things going on. But as the story went on, it all made more sense, and looking back, I can see it was actually nicely well done. Part of the plot deals with poison. The protagonist, Ismea, is learned in this art, and even has a special little ability involving poison that becomes a vital part of the story. Fans of Poison Study I think will love this book. While reading it, I was actually reminded a little of Pride and Prejudice. Ismae has an Elizabeth aura, shes strong and dependent and wont let men take control of her. Duval is Mr. Darcy, with his good looks and prejudice against Ismae. Ann, Duvals sister whom he loves and valiantly protects, and who absolutely adores Duval, is Georgiana. Anns mother is the Lady Catherine De Bourgh with her less than desirable qualities. Perhaps thats part of why the novel captured me so, the connection I felt to PP. Ismae and Duvals romance starts out similar to Darcy and Lizzie, with dislike and strain at the beginning, but then the individuals slowly coming to realize the good qualities in the other person. The ending was superb, with its twists and danger and excitement. Kept me turning er..tapping the pages in a rush to see the outcome. Upon finishing Grave Mercy, I was deep in love with it, with the characters, and not wanting to part with them. And oh, am I excited for the companion novel! Grave Mercy is a fantastic murder mystery, historical, magical, romantic story that kicks butt! LaFevers created a wonderful story that many people will love. Thank you for sharing your story! And now, just one more thing to say, MORE PLEASE!! Thank you to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Netgalley for the arc.
Edit This is how I picture Dimitri   drools Pretty much spoiler free but completely bias rambling! Favourite Quote: He smiled at me . . . fondly. Ah, my daughter, he said. Eighteen, and already youve been accused of murder, aided felons, and acquired a death count higher than most guardians will ever see. He paused. I couldnt be prouder. That is not really my favourite it just a lot of fun, I didnt want give a spoiler! I cant believe it is over. This is the first series that I got addicted too, Rose is one my all time favourite protagonist and Dimitri was my first literary crush. And now I am feeling kind of sad that it is the end, a little bit excited for the new spin off series Bloodlines and happy with the way it ended well mostly. Firstly, I thought I would explain why I love this series so:  Brilliant writing. Even in the 6th installment Mead still manages to surprise me. The plot always moves at the right pace and has a wonderful blend of action, witty dialogue and romance. Rose  strong, opinionated and loyal  the kind of girl who saves herself. The romance  Great sexual tension and sizzling chemistry plus moments that make your heart ache. Yet it never over powers the plot. And now my thoughts on how it all ended: Although the plot surprised me never would of guessed who the killer was, I did see from the beginning who Rose was going to end up with and thankfully I thought it was the right choice. Although it did hurt to see the other guy get his heart crushed and he did big time. I felt he didnt get the happiness he deserved and it was left unresolved. The way Mead ended that situation has lead me to believe that he will be in the spin off quite a bit. I also expected a lot more tears in the final instalment but surprisingly it made me smile more than cry. It certainly wasnt as painful as the last two books. The new characters were interesting and made me laugh. It was nice to have some new elements to the story. Overall, I have to give this 5 stars because over the last few years this series has made laugh, smile, cry, scream and I have loved every minute of it.
When I take you, it will be because you cant wait another fucking second, and youll be begging me to take you to a place where only you and I exist, a place where only I can show you I love your heart as much as your body, your mind and everything else that makes you you. I have to admit that I had trouble writing this review. There are so many components that made it so amazing that I wouldnt want to risk spoiling it for you. I do however NEED to mention that Sawyer is quite impressive in this story. If you remember in the previous books he was portrayed as a hardcore player. Once he met his one he unexpectedly changed into this perfect and ideal man. I can not tell you how many times I feel in love with his character in this book. He fell so deeply for Emmett he did basically did everything to win her heart. Of course knowing his history Emmett had her hesitations. All she could offer in the beginning was friendship. To me that was one of the best things I loved about this book. As much as they were both drawn to each other they made it a point to start their relationship from the basics. Emmett had such a disturbing past but did this change the way he felt about her? Nope. Its as if he fell further in love and was 100 accepting of her complicated position. Where most men would have turned the other way he made it a point to share the heavy burden that she carried. Who could resist a man like that? Just like the previous Evolve books, I thought that the main couples pairing was remarkable. Their chemistry was friggin spectacular. They complimented each other perfectly and in every way. Early on they had multiple bumps in the road but all of those issues was what made them stronger. I also loved the fact that all of the Crew specifically Dane and Laney were supportive with both Sawyer and Emmett individually and as a couple. Again the entire dynamics amongst the friends was evident all through out the story. I mentioned in a past review that Evolve was one of my favorite NA series. After reading Sawyers story it further backed up this claim. Every single book is fun freakin fantastic. For me, it just keeps getting better and better! Believe me when I say this... this is one series that you do not want to miss. liezelsbookblog.net
Rating: 4.55 Minor spoilers I wasnt sure what I was expecting with this book, but I was definitely delivered a great story. I was debating between a 4 and 4.5 rating, but as most reviews say, the ending was amazing, so I gave it 4.5. This book is a whirlwind of the good kind and a great read. This book is about a girl named Ruby who lives in a world where children and teenagers either died of a disease called IAAN, and if they didnt, developed strange abilities. The government was scared of these children, and decided that they needed to control every single one of them. They brought them into camps where they were not allowed to use their abilities lest they face punishment. The first portion of the book shows a bit of Rubys life before she was brought to the camp, and what living in the camp is like. To be honest, the first few chapters confused me a bit. One chapter would be in camp, one would be before camp, and the jumps in time left me a bit confused. The story was actually quite slow in some places. The beginning was great, the end was amazing, but the middle just seemed to drag on, although there was some much needed character development there. It was a bit predictable in places but also surprising in others. I loved Ruby as a protagonist, but sometimes she just seemed too naive. I think she wanted to see the best in people, and it screwed her over more than once. The teenagers in this book seemed real, and interacted with each other the way an actual teenager would. I found the book interesting from the beginning, but I only got super into it during the last bit of the book. The ending was great. I was so sad! It reminded me of the end of Champion by Marie Lu. I wonder if hes ever going to be able to get his memories back, and if he does, would he forgive her? Where the story wasnt interesting, I kept reading because I really liked the writing style and the characters. This story was a great read, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy andor scifi type books. Even if you dont Id say give it a try, since you might like it. Its really worth reading!
4.5 stars Originally posted at:  I seriously dont know how Im going to go about writing this review without giving something away. Ill try my very best to keep it spoilerfree, but trust me, it will be difficult. Ive always heard of Patrick Ness books but Id never gotten the chance to read one until now. Thanks to Pansing, I got my hands on a copy of More Than This because once I saw John Greens blurb on the front cover, I was immediately intrigued. The book summary doesnt give much away and I knew from the start that this novel was going to be different. I really loved this one. Not only does it have HOLYBLEEPINGStwists, but the story was very well developed that I couldnt put it down. MINISPOILERS AHEAD This isnt too big a spoiler since you learn about it within the first 30 pages, but our main characters name is Seth. The narrative is really interesting as it alternates between his present actions as well as his memories. We as readers are able to catch glimpses of his life leading up to the moment he drowns. Secrets are uncovered throughout the story and the motive for why he drowned is revealed slowly, and its truly mindnumbing to see how much his character has been through. I thought it would have been really cool if the book only had him as a character in it during present action, but things definitely got interesting with the addition of two certain characters. I mentioned previously that there are HUGE twists. And I mean HUGE. Seriously I did not see half the things that happen in this book coming. Theres definitely a lot more to the afterlife that our main character finds himself in. At first, I was a little mad about the twist. I thought that it threw away the whole believability of the book out the window. But as the story went on, I came to understand what the book truly is and grasp somewhat what its underlying message is. What I am most taken with though is Ness writing. ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. Seriously, he could have written a book about cats sitting still for hours and I would still be in love with the prose. I can see now why hes such a talented writer and why his books get so much praise. More Than This was enthralling, as horrifying revelations and gutwrenching truths shed some light onto this new world that our protagonist finds himself in. This is a a book that will have you on the edge of your seat, desperate to find out what happens next. Beautiful and lifechanging, without a doubt, there is no book like this one.    Thank you so much to Sasha at Pansing for sending me a copy for review!   
I cant believe that this is over. The Lunar Chronicles series, one of my favorite series of all time, came to an end and I finished this beast of an 800 page book. Because this is the last book of the series, I will keep this review brief and as nonspoilery as I can. To put it simply, I feel like this final installment is very satisfying and is probably my favorite book in the series. This series is one of those series where each book is better than the last, and Winter is, in my opinion, the best one. Everything just comes together and the intensity was high throughout the entire duration of the book. Winter was, without a doubt, a fulfilling final installment that wont disappoint you. Admittedly, I did have a couple of problems with it, that maybe a thing or two seemed too convenient and that none of the MAJOR characters except for Levana died , but for the most part they are minor complaints I have for the book. Winter was a fantastic concluding novel, from the obvious or more subtle references to the four fairy tales this series was inspired from to the characters and relationship development to Marissa Meyers amazing writing, this book is everything you could ask you in a finale. In the whole picture of the series, I couldnt recommend this series enough to anyone and everyone. I feel like this is one of the few series who could appeal to everyone. For the romancelovers, the causal readers, to the hardcore ones and to those who are just looking for a dystopian read; The Lunar Chronicles can fit for just about anyone.  1231: After reading thoughts Thank the stars I finished this book before 2016 rolled around, for it was so good and a fantastic read to end 2015.  118: This is currently my most anticipated thing in life and I need it now. I mean sure, I am currently reading like four other books that I should be getting to right now, but I need to read this right now.  Sometime in 2014... WAIT. NOVEMBER 2015? This certainly must be some kind of joke! November 2015. I DONT THINK I CAN WAIT THAT LONG. If this is real, and not some kind of joke... I hope to god that this is not true and that it will come out earlier, but LATE 2015. NO. NO. I SWEAR I CAN NOT WAIT THAT LONG. I WILL DIE JUST WAITING FOR ITS RELEASE. sigh At least well be getting Fairest early next year, but I hope itll be enough to make me live the wait for Winter.
Warning Mild spoilers Six of Crows was so mindblowing good. I have read the Grisha trilogy and loved it put Six of Crows is totally different. This book is full of criminals, I am talking, thieves, murderers, conmen and more. The Six of Crows is about a major heist and Kaz and his crew are the ones to pull it off. You cant help but like this crazy mix of characters. Kaz is 17 and the ringleader of this group. He has a really dark past, he did everything he had to do in order to survive and his dark past causes problems in his present. Kaz is incredible smart, looks at things from all angles and loves a good puzzle. He is so dark and badass, he is the epitome of bad boy in this book and I really like him. Inej is 16 and is know as the Wraith. She comes from Ravaka, shes smart and moves in the shadows like a spy. She has had a hard time and wants to others that are like her. Inej believes in herself and doesnt let much get her down. She is my favorite character in the book. She is in her situation not by choice but because of circumstance, which means she is a little different from the other characters. I really do love the entire crew, even Matthias, although he did grow on me. As for the other characters: Nina is a strong Grisha solider who loves life and has made mistakes. Matthias was a boy who had something bad happen in his past and he became lost. He believed in the ways of his people and couldnt see the truth. However, overtime Matthias realized the truth and he made his choice. Jesper has ADD, a secret, an addiction problem and a good shooter but all he wants is Kaz approval. Jesper is not a bad person but he can do better. And as for Wylan, he was a little annoying but as time went on I saw his dark side, he smart and his secret was reveal, now I cant help but want to protect Wylan a little. Six of Crows was actionpacked and I loved seeing how the characters interacted with each other and how everything was playing out. Some things I knew but most I didnt and the plot twist kept me on my toes. I was nervous for the crew until the very end and I cannot imagine the hell that will be unleashed in the next book. Cant wait!
What if we had a chance to do it again and again, until we finally did get it right? Wouldnt that be wonderful? Would it? I believe everyone would love a chance to go back and change things in their past. Correct mistakes in order to change their life or their loved ones lives for the better. But changing one thing may only lead to a new problem......then you have to go back, change the first mistake, then the second one, and so on. I dont know about you, but this sounds exhausting to me. Ursula gets the chance to get it right over and over again. She is born on a snowy night in February 1910, but since she is born with no doctor present, and with the umbilical cord around her neck she never breaths a breath. Ursula is born on a snowy night in February 1910; the doctor makes it in time to save the little girl from nearly straggling on her own umbilical cord. Through it all, Ursula lives many lives and dies many deaths. Each time she is reborn in the same life, same date, same circumstances but each time she has a certain amount of recall from former times around and she is able to make choices to avoid catastrophe....but new catastrophes, and new deaths, always crop up and they need a fixing the next time around. Every time she made the right decision and avoided some horrible fate it I would be so happy and Id hope that maybe this time would be the last time for Ursula, that she would finally get to rest even though I didnt want the book to end, but no, there was always the snow. This book is just beautiful. Painstakingly researched and sublimely written, Life After Life has found a place on my Favorites shelf. Kate Atkinson wrote about life in WWII England and in WWII Germany in such a human way that I dont believe I ever really felt, or understood, what it was truly like until I read this book. What it was like to live with the threat of being bombed every single night, horrifying. Or what it was like to live under the rule of a crazy man, loving him and worshiping him as the savior of your country only to realize, too late, who he really was. I love this book and this quote that I hate to admit hits a little too close to home. Ursula craved solitude but she hated loneliness, a conundrum that she couldnt even begin to solve.
Full Review in about 10 minutes while I wrap my head around what the hell I just finished reading!! FULL REVIEW The idea seemed silly, sitting down with a kid I didnt know and making a plan for a future Id never thought of, but from some reason the thought of hurting his feelings made my chest feel stabby, a feeling I was very unfamiliar with. Brantley King and Samuel Clearwater forged a friendship early on...one that lasted through the most messed up situations either one could ever dream of. From the day they met, they were King and Preppy, and they knew that despite the hand they had been dealt, they would be their own people, doing their own things, making money, answering to nobody for the rest of their lives...and they did just that. This is just about Preppy and King crawling out of the shit instead of rotting in it. I know what youre thinkingsurely there is another player in this game. Actually, there are many. So many in fact that if I told you, Id have to kill you because it would ruin the story. But, there is one more that is absolutely one you need to know about. Doe. As in Jane Doe. I dont know where I came from. I dont know how old I am. I dont know my real name. All I had in the world was reflected back at me in the bathroom mirror of that gas station, and I had no clue who she was. One fateful night, Doe crosses paths with King. Large, scared blueeyes to piercing, angry green ones... What she never imagined was that the man who planned on taking revenge out on her because of her friend, turns out to the be the very man who saves her life...and gives her a new one. Just because he was a very bad boy, that doesnt mean he couldnt be a truly great man. But is the one she wanted? OH MY GOD!! Seriously?!?! How can you finish a book like that?!? Im still trying to pick my jaw up off the floor. I cant even... I dont know where to start! There is so much I loved about this book. It was raw, it was edgy, it was straight up HOT! It was funnyI LOVED Preppy! I dont think Ive laughed that much and with each of his crazy sayings I pictured him in his bow tie and suspenders...it was perfect! Nothing like a cliffhanger though...that damn cliffhanger...August is too far away, I may need to get on Frazier about BETA reading Tyrant because I dont think I can wait that long. 5 King of Causeway, Stars
Kasie Wests young adult debut novel Pivot Point is a great example of an interesting and fresh idea turned into a compulsively readable and well executed book. What West excels at is her ability in weaving two timelines of two separate futures together seamlessly, each with its own events, characters, mysteries, and romances. With this we see Addies two juxtaposing worlds, her Para life in the Compound surrounded by others with high intellectual and mind powers like her, as well as her Norm life outside the Compound in Dallas, Texas where she must keep her abilities a secret and pretend to be a Norm  normal human. Addie is able to see into the future because she is a Searcher, which means that whenever she must make a choice she is able to experience and look at the two futures and their consequences, making her choice that much easier to make. What forces Addie to Search and which springs the novels plots into motion is the decision she must make when her parents announce theyre divorcing: to stay with her mother in the Compound, with her friends, or go with her father to live in the outside world, someplace much different to the one she knows. What makes Addie such a great character is her innate intuition at knowing what she must do and the fine line between right and wrong; her ability to Search may be the reason for this. Whether itd be helping her friend Laila with the trouble she is in in relation to this guy called Poison and Lailas father, to her friendship and eventual fondness with Trevor whom I really liked as a male love interest for Addie and really... ever!, to her struggling relationship with Duke, her mother, and her father, Addies attempts to put things right even within her Searches proves her greatest strength. Wests dialogue shines bright throughout the book. But what I believed needed a little more explanation was the Compound, its conception and its politics, decisionmakers and workings as a society consisting of people with mind abilities. I did not know that there was going to be a sequel when reading this, but now that I know, hopefully a greater understanding for the Compound and it relation to the outside world will be given. Im glad I listened to Ambers advice to read Pivot Point because I was not let down by it and what was promised. Kasie West is a new author that Ill be keeping my eye on for years to come in the young adult world.
RATING:  All the guiltridden stars! REVIEW: Lets talk about one of my absolute favorite character developments in all of bookdom: The Guilt of the Righteous did that need caps, probably not, but it felt right so I went with it. I love the deep, souldestroying anguish! Maybe thats a little twisted, but oh, the feels, so many feels. Not sure what Im talking about? Its something that I see done most effectively lately in Young Adult FantasyScifiDystopian, books. Its when our hero or heroines actions, though justifiable, have left such a stain of guilt upon their inner psyche that its nearly debilitating. And it cant really be achieved until the second, or later, book. Now, jumping into A Court of Mist and Fury ACOMAF for the cool kids with my first paragraph I think you see where this is going. Feyre is damaged. The guilt is eating her alive Im tapping my fingers together in absolute delight from all the delicious emotion...wow Im turning into an evil reading succubus or something...I make no apologies!!!. This excessive guilt isnt really a spoiler, its pretty evident from page one, and just the beginning of this books journey, though like I said, I love that crushing emotion so much that its probably my favorite aspect of this book, because its what leads to everything else to follow. My extended network of bookloving friends did not lie when they said that this book beat out the first. But in saying that, I dont like to look at it as one book being better than the other, because the fact is that the first book was executed so perfectly as to create the base for this book, which wouldnt be possible without book one. I would rather look on it as an amazing series, as a whole, that just gets better and better. In fact, now knowing how perfectly book one led into book two, I wish I could up my star rating of the first book from 4 to 5 stars but that would be cheating and entirely wrong from a proper reviewer, so of course Ill let well enough alone. Im trying to keep this spoiler free, and as with most of my reviews, its just me rambling all the thoughts in my head, but heres what I can tell you. All the characters grow in this book, for better or worse. We meet some fantastic new characters and learn a ton of new history. The overall story arc has begun to form a much clearer picture and by the end we mostly know what the characters will be up against in future books. AND, I was satisfied with the ending. It left much to be done, but it also left us with just the right amount of hope and a bit of a secret smile. Sarah J. Maas has done it again! Sucking us in from page one with her outstanding characters and artfully crafted world. Im ready for book three please!
The world that Maggie Stiefvater creates is beautiful, eerie and original. The prose matches the atmosphere perfectly and sets a dreamy, magical tone. The characters are one of the best that Ive come across in a long time, all of them with good and bad sides, with their own troubles and quirks. They felt like long lost friends and I enjoyed every second spent in their company. Blue Sargent is an unusual YA heroine with her spiky hair, tough and yet at times gentle attitude and colorful clothes. She befriends the four raven boys and joins them on a quest to find the sleeping king. Needles to say I loved their interactions, especially the banter between Blue and Gansey. Gansey is another great character, who suffers from rich people problems and yet he is still relatable, sweet, funny and driven. His obsession with finding the king was endearing, as well as his unwavering loyalty to his friends. Adam is the only one of the raven boys who grew up poor in an abusive home. That boy broke my heart so many times, I love his pride, dedication and resilience. If I could, Id make sure hes forever surrounded by hugs, puppies, chocolate and everything else good in the world because he truly needs it. Ronan is a mysterious and at first unlikable figure, but as the story progressed he quickly became my favorite. His care for the little raven Chainsaw is endearing and shows his softer side, and his loyalty and protectiveness of his friends is another feature that I appreciated. Noah remains a cryptic and slightly distant figure throughout the novel, but later on I cheered for him and hope to see more of him in the next books! As for Blues family, I greatly enjoyed their interactions, it felt like Ive known them forever. These women are strong, quirky, warm and fierce at the same time and Blue is lucky to have them. The search for ley lines and The Raven King hooked me completely, despite the fact that Im a huge skeptic when it comes to anything supernatural. It was at times scary and intense, and the writing set the perfect mysterious and creepy feel to the story. The combination of foundling ravens, speaking trees, enchanted forests along with orange cars, family life and school has worked extremely well, kudos to Stiefvater for pulling it off. There isnt a single thing I didnt love about this story and I cant wait to read the sequels. Reading it felt like walking through a vivid dream and Im not yet ready to wake up and say goodbye.
I have read two books by Philippa Gregory previous to this. The first book I read by her was The White Queen, about Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV, motherinlaw of Henry VII. I found the book intriguing, but not too good. For quite a while, despite the popularity of The Other Boleyn Girl, I did not pick up any other book by her. The Lady of the Rivers, by Philippa Gregory, about Jacquetta, the mother of Elizabeth Woodville, was breathtaking! This was an engagingly told story of the daughter of Melusina, who has the gift of sight. She is at the forefront of so many changes in fortunes, of her own and those of the throne. The deep love she bears for her commoner husband, Richard Woodville is central to the story. Jacquetta is shown as a woman who tries to avoid the cutthroat politics of court and strives to serve the king and queen with loyalty. I loved the descriptions of the court, and how the couple, Jacquetta and Richard try to lead the life of a normal couple, concerned about their children and their futures apart from the hurly burly of the court. Richard is forever away on some campaign set by the king, and Jacquetta has to be at the court at the Queens side. This lovely book is what made me read the story of The White Princess, Cousins War. This story is about the daughter of Elizabeth Woodville and Edward IV, married to the bitter enemy of her parents, Henry VII. He ascends to the throne of England by defeating and killing King Richard of York in the battle of Bosworth. His wedding to Elizabeth of York is solemnized to cement his claims to the throne of England. This was to end the war of the Roses. The white rose of York is seen as finally merging into the red rose of the Plantagenets. The cousins war does end, but not without its cost. Henry VII is tormented by suspicion as to the loyalty of his subjects. He feels the people of England yearn for the return of the Yorks. The story had a good start, as Elizabeth mourns Richard and is torn between the advantage of marrying the King and the disgust she feels at marrying the man who killed her lover. Later, the pace turns languid as the novel harps on Henrys suspicions. The appearance of the lost Prince of York injects some life into the story, but the advantage is soon lost.
Okay seriously, how am I already gearing up to read the final book of this series?! I just started the first novel on Friday and its only Tuesday today.... Anyways I am so glad I decided to pick up this series after halffinishing it about 5 years ago when it was first published. I quickly devoured the first three, which I had read before, but this one was new to me and I absolutely loved it! So happy I picked this up again. Armentrout really packed a punch with this novel. Between the actionpacked drama, Daemon and Kats growing love, new characters Archer! yay, betrayal, and many new difficult situations this book leaves you breathless. Daemon and Katy had already been through so much but they cant seem to escape awful situations. They both tried to protect each other but as we learn in this novel there are so many other, bigger things going on besides the Arum or government. Although they definitely play their part in Daemon and Katys misery, forces beyond the both of them are at work... Katy has always been headstrong and brave but she really takes it to the next level in this novel. And if there was ANY shadow of a doubt that Daemon doesnt love her, it is clearly swept away in this novel. Daemon proves he would literally do anything for Katy and their Las Vegas wedding, even though it isnt 100 real as they married under fake names, was SO ADORABLE. With all the terrible things that had happened to them, this moment together was so nice. I almost wish this wasnt a YA book though so we could have more than just a fadetoblack type situation haha oh god I am a pervert . ...We all know from the beginning that Katy has fallen for Daemon but I absolutely loved this quote: I dont expect a normal life, Daemon. I just expect a life with you. Of course the ending has another huge cliffhanger making me want to read the next book even more! Cliffhangers can be such a hit or miss with me but Armentrout writes them perfectly and doesnt make me feel like it is some big set up to get me to read on. Overall such an amazing series and I cant wait to read the final book Opposition. Featherbrained Books Blog  Twitter 
I admit, I really enjoyed MOST of this book. If we were going to put a percentage on this review instead of stars I would say about 75 of the book was amazing. But that 25 was extremely annoying and flipping ridiculous. Alina is not my kind of MC, Im not going to say I hated her, but she and I have a relationship that does not quite equate to love but isnt very far from hate... if that makes sense. Alina is that girl who in one minute is saying Im so alone, and no one likes me. Im a nobody, just so plain sigh I wish I was who they want me to be, but I just cant do it and then not even 10 minutes later is like, Im so stubborn and Im going to stand my ground, stick up for myself because Im a strong and stubborn girl. Oh and Im super stubborn, and like super strong and really strong minded. And stubborn, Im just going to try and be strong. SHUT UP! Dont get me wrong I had brief moments of acceptance with Alina, but more often than not she was predictable and annoying. Her choices and common sense was embarrassing and made her character unrelatable. The love story was weak, and then strong and then bam I love you, let me die for you. SO yeah, that was fun says no one. Ok, so youre asking yourself, Um Alex, why did you rate it 4 stars if you didnt like the main characters over half the time? THE WORLD! The world building and easy flow of words in the book made it worth it. I was so captivated by the premise and plot of this story, I couldnt be mad. And since they werent horrible 100 of the time I cant be angry. The story telling in Shadow and Bones is magnificent! I could taste, smell, picture and feel everything that the author so elegantly described. And though I wish she had more depth to her characters, I think the next one might be able to offer that. The world that was built and crafted so well is lethal and magical, so much that I didnt have to question or alter my imagination at all. You know that saying I want to escape to a new world this is that world. This book is the perfect escape, and I absolutely recommend it. Over all a pretty good Young Adult book, I will absolutely continue on with this series and cant wait to see what happens. I do hope the next one is more action packed and the characters develop a bit more, but nothing will take away from this one. The known world I know Ill dream about. Enjoy :
Review here:  Plot This book is based on Indian mythology, which was great! I love all types of mythology, but I dont know a lot about Indian. Mayas horoscope decides once, and for all who she really is. She brings Death everywhere she goes. People in her fathers kingdom treat her like trash. But on a fateful day, Mayas father the king decides to host a swayamvara. Sort of like a contest to decide her husband. All to save her kingdom. But Maya somehow finds her in a terribble situation. Only to be saved by the mysterious prince of Akaran. Gradually, she finds herslf falling in love with this prince. Until, a lie shatters the beatiful world she once knew... Like I said, it was a great novel, but I did have a few problems with it. For one thing, the plot seemed a little jumbled up, and very confusing towards the end. And the timing in the end seemed fast paced for my liking. There is also a lot of reincarnation stuff, which I wanted to stay away from ever since reading Daughter of Smoke and Bone. This was better organized, and more understandale. And I love how Maya got to see all her past lives, and how they connected with Amar. PLOT TWIST, PLOT TWIST! So many of those, which just kept the book interesting. static Characters Maya  I liked her very much. From only the beginning to the middle. When it came to the end, she was getting on my nerves! Maya was weak in the beginning, but she was smart, and slick. I liked that about her. She did keep on letting all the harem wives get under her skin though, which was not something I expect for someone partnered with death. Maya was not a boring character. I just love her feirce personality, and her ability to keep us readers that is on our toes. That was in the beginning. In the end, I was very dissapointed on how easily she was fooled by Nimitri. And how she kept on wasting time on other things then her main goal, which was GET TO AMAR. If I were her I would run and not stop until I found Amar but then I wouldnt be easily fooled Amar  I wish I could know more about him. Amar is the love interest of Maya. And he is the Dharam Raja. He is partnered with Death. Or he is Death. The book doesnt really explain well what he is. I cant write that much abourt him because we dont know that much about him! But, I do know that his love for Maya, is like Jaces love for Clary. Yes, its that deep. I didn;t really like how he kept some important stuff away from Maya because he wanted her to discover it herself which just resulted in Maya running away. He reminds me of Khalid from The Wrath and The Dawn. Writing Style This a debut book, and really the writing style was very exotic in its own way. It had a sense of something mystic. This fit the book because it is based on Indian Mythology, and has a lot of mystery to it.
Check out all my reviews on Clues and Reviews  Emma, dealing with a traumatic break in, is looking for a fresh start. Jane, after a stillbirth, needs a place to start over. Both women find themselves at One Folgate Street, a house that is an architectural masterpiece and a minimalists dream. Years apart, each woman applies to be a tenant and each woman develop their own relationship with the man behind the design, Edward Monkford. When Jane finds out that years earlier, the previous tenant, Emma, died in the home, she begins investigating the death. Untangling a web of lies, she follows down a similar path and soon finds herself in the same danger as the girl before. The Girl Before, by JP Delaney a pseudonym, is a book that has been getting consistent amounts of buzz in the book blogging world; I was dying to read this one! I was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy and I have to say, I have some seriously mixed feelings about this book. I found myself feeling equal parts mesmerized and strange while I was reading. What I Liked: The Narration: the novel is narrated with alternating viewpoints from tenants at One Folgate Street: Jane, the present tenant and from Emma, the woman who lived there previously. This technique kept me glued to this book. The segmented chapters are short and sweet and use the right amount of hook to carry the story along. As the womens experiences begin to mirror each other, things become creepy really quickly. Throwback to Gothic Literature: Fun Fact. I have always been a fan of classic gothic fiction and this novel certainly resonates with this genre. From the massive, sterile house to our female protagonists threatened by a powerful, tyrannical male, this one had moments where it read like Ann Radcliffes The Mysteries of Udolpho. I really liked how this one gave a modern twist on the gothic novel and combined it with the domestic thriller genre that has swept 2016 by storm. What I Didnt Like: Kind of gave me a Fifty Shades of Grey vibe: Edward Monkford was Christian Grey to me. The novel had moments where sexual domination took the lead and the actual story took the backburner. I have a very hard time taking a book seriously when the character, which is supposed to be the antagonist, is consistently referred to as Daddy. I feel like I would have enjoyed the book much more if this part of the book had taken on a smaller role. Regardless of my feelings about that portion of the book, I cannot deny that this one kept me up, late into the night, to finish. I was consumed by the plot and need to find out what happened. It already has the movie rights sold, so I will be intrigued to see how this will play out on the big screen. If you are a fan of a dark, twisting thriller, then I would recommend this book. However, if you hated the idea of Fifty Shades of Grey, then chances are, you will not appreciate this one either! Thank you to Penguin Random House Canada and the author, JP Delaney, for a copy of this one!
Update 101215 The movie was great! Update 10215 The Martian movie opens today. My local paper rated the movie 4 12 stars. Cant wait to see it! Update 122214: Weve chosen The Martian as one of our favorite Science Fiction books of 2014 on Badass Book Reviews. Be sure to check out our Best of 2014 lists. Now back to your regularly scheduled review: Wow. Wow. Wow. I think I fell in love with Mark Watney. This is a review of the audio book version of The Martian and it was just amazing. The narrator captured Marks personality and moods and made this audio book one of the best Ive listened to this year. Mark is on a mission on Mars with five other astronauts. When a deadly sandstorm hits, Marks spacesuit is compromised and Mark is left for dead on the planet. Mark manages to survive the injury but now he is alone and must come up with the basic elements of life. Mark is remarkably calm about his situation. He takes account of all of his supplies and starts to put together a survival plan. Mark is the MacGyver of Mars. He rigs up equipment to make water, create oxygen, and sometimes he needs to run away and cower in the rover as the byproducts are explosive. Marks journal entries show an amazing knowledge of science and engineering. Mark also has his goofy times, too. When NASA was wondering just what Mark was thinking, he was thinking about Aquaman. If you can get your hands on the audio book, do it. Its a great listen for a long road trip. Guaranteed to keep the kids 12 listening. Note: There are a few Fbombs in the story, but understandably so  Mark is stuck on Mars with no communication, and no way home. Id use the Fword too. Highly recommended. Updated 72514  OK, just listened to this on a road trip and there is a lot of swearing. Kid3 15 years old enjoyed the story so much that he forced himself to stay awake until the end. Husband also enjoyed the story. Science geeks and botany dorks should enjoy this book. And if youve never tried an audio book, this is a good one to start with. By the way, Ive now listened to this book 3 times and it still entertains.
5 Freaking Emotional Stars You dont get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices... So I put off reading this book ever since it was initially published and since it was that one book that was all anyone could talk about... yeah it became that book. You book readers know what Im talking about. I thought that the praise for the book would skew how I felt about it, in a negative way as it always tends to happen. So I decided to wait for the buzz to blow over... only it never did. And now with the movie coming out I feared the worst. Maybe I waited too long to read the book and my plan for it to diedown had severely backfired. I could not be more wrong. Perhaps that is true with most ordinary books, but as John Green has proved over and over again, a good book is a good book and sometimes, the praise is welldeserved. No way was this book going to be better than my favorite Green book, Looking for Alaska, and it wasnt but it was still damn good. Good god was this book emotional. No, I did not cry. I dont cry in books Exception: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows when Dobby dies.... uugh... plus I already knew Gus dies, I spoiled it for myself like 1 year ago . Its kind of my thing I guess. I also saw the movie 7 hours after I finished reading the book and no, I did not cry then either. Not for my lack of trying, believe me. I was so upset that I didnt cry that I wanted to cry because I didnt. it also didnt help that I watched the movie with a theater filled with 12  16 year old girls who would not shut the f up Anyways, And for all that backlash that Green has been getting for glorifying cancer patients. Good grief, are you kidding me!? This book was anything but glorifying. He hit the steering wheel weakly, the car honking as he cried. He leaned his head back, looking up. I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this I disgust myself I hate it I hate it just let me fucking die I think that scene there was the closest I came to crying in the book. It felt too real. According to the conventions of the genre, Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage... but this was the truth, a pitiful boy who desperately wanted not to be pitiful, screaming and crying, poisoned by an infected Gtube that kept him alive, but not alive enough I had to put the book down at some point because it was all a little too real. John Green has an amazing way of storytelling and I dont think I can ever not be disappointed in his stories. except Paper Towns...... huh, it appears that their is always an exception. Really fast read... what are you waiting for? Get to it!
Wow. Right from the sight of this book, I was hooked. The hardcover is amazingly wellcrafted with a fun sleeve to put it over it I love it either way. And, without reading a word, just taking a sneak peek at the pages, I knew that I would love how this story was put together. I did! Every last single letter in every word on every page! I wanted to put some time between my finishing this book and writing a review for it to gain some perspective. I wanted to write something other than, OMG, OMG, OMG! But Im sorry friends, I just dont think Ill be able to achieve that distance. Two weeks later and I just want to reread this book a million times until the sequel. This is just what I wanted from a book YA or otherwise! It reminded me of some of my favorite stories: a little bit of Firefly  Serenitythank you Joss Whedon and a bit of Rick Yanceys Fifth Wave trilogy. This a fierce battle for survival with many players and lots of devastating twists and turns along the way. Heres what it boils down to: Kady and Ezra are in the middle of another fight, possibly their last fight when a battleship opens fire on their small mining planet. Kady and Ezra have to figure a way to get to safety, hopefully with their families, before their entire planet is eradicated. Part of the population manages to get safely off the planet but not without the battleship trailing behind them. Now, they must find a way to get to safety without dying of starvation, a terrible plague, or at the hands off the battleship hellbent on destroying them! Crazy, right? Terrifying, nervewracking, and overthetop intense, this story will have you sitting on the edge of your seat the whole ride trying to figure out what comes next! This story has an amazing voice, told from several perspectives and in several mediums. The two main characters are badass but at the same time, emotionally vulnerable and clinging to each other as the last remnants of their broken world. Even the AI comes off as less robotic and as a kind of misunderstood entity... strange as that seems. I cannot sing the praises of this book enough... but Ill stop here and just anxiously await the next one!
Naturally, Im going to buy and read this. Its Harry Potter after all! I grew up with this series! It has been and will forever be a huge part of my life. AND YET, just reading Harry Potter 8 up there makes me cringe and my skin crawl. There are no words to describe how mad I am at this. When I first heard about the play I was all but amused. I was angry for two reasons: Although it was considered canon, only the fortunate people whod make it to the theatre would actually get to experience it well, look at that, they just got rid of the problem. However most importantly, I was angry because it is canon, because it exists. Yes, I love Harry Potter with all my heart but I DONT WANT ANY MORE  sequels that is! God, what Id give for prequels about the Marauders or Vodemort or the original Order of the Phoenix or preferrably all of theses. When I read the ending of book 7 not quite 9 years ago, I was a little disappointed and very very worried. I feared this would happen and that it actually happens makes me very sad. Im of the unpopular opinion that SPOILERS FROM HERE ON FOR THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH  but come on, if you still havent read book 7, get back under the rock you came from  both Voldemort AND Harry should have died. Why? Well, because then there would have been an ending! There would have been a satisfying end to Harry Potter with no more sequels on the horizon x years after it was published. I hate when they decide to give sequels to series that had wonderful and satisfying endings long after they ended. To be honest, I wouldnt have minded but ONLY if my favoured ending scenario would have happened so much about sequels about other characters andor their kids because it wouldnt have been Harry freaking Potter ha, random Starkid reference anymore. It would have been something new and I would have been fine with it. Not totally fine, though, I probably wouldnt have been very amused but I would have returned if Id felt like it  and wouldnt have felt the pressure to read it. Yes, I feel like I have to read this no matter what, because how could I not?! Its Harry Potter and I have to know what the hell is going on. Besides, the Internet is dark and full of spoilers. Im not really looking forward to reading this because Im afraid. Im really truly afraid. Growing up with Harry Potter has been the experience of a lifetime. Its hardly possible this sequel will be able to hold a candle to those books, to all those memories, to MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD, damn it! Im so afraid I wont like it, that it will somehow ruin the series in retrospect for me. Oh God, why does this have to exist?! Unpopular opinion over and out.
So this is my second time rereading Crown of Midnight and I have to say a few of my views have changed about this one. I still think this book was an absolute adventure! I found Chaolena very very very cute still, the romance aspect I will always love. And the things that were revealed about Dorian and Celaena throughout the book were some of my favorite parts! But then there was how Chaol reacted to Celaena at the end that made me.. I dont know.. dislike him kinda like how I did in Queen of Shadows. I cant say more about that without spoilers, but I feel like the last couple of chapters is where I really started to not like Chaol anymore and yes, I know this is probably bias because I already know what happens. I dont care. Dorian and Celaena though! Their friendship is one for the books. I feel like they have the type of relationship most people wish for after a break up. Now, besides all the loveydovey business, I enjoyed the mysterious youhavetofigureitoutwiththecharacter feel of book two. The puzzles and riddles were drawn out just enough and I found that the revealings thats what Ill call them were timed well in the story. Also, you really do feel tons of emotions going through this book. I can remember myself smiling, laughing, cringing, on the verge of tears, and definitely definitely anxious while reading. The action is described so spot on, its like a movie in your head. Thats why I love Maass writing so much! ONTO THE NEXT ONE! First read review September 2015: This book was beyond any other book Ive ever read. It was absolutely spectacular. If I could give this book 10 or 100 stars I would. There was so much adventure, betrayal, sadness, and happiness. There were twists and turns I didnt see coming! The writing was delicious I drank up every word of it for an entire day straight just to finish! Celaena is such a loveable character. She has so many different phases and realizations and secrets you just want to keep getting to know her. Chaol, ever loyal to a fault, is still who I want her to be with. Hes literally P.E.R.F.E.C.T. And Dorian, what you learn about him in this book also makes him so much more appealing. How can one girl choose? This sequel was the best sequel Ive ever read. The character development, the plot development, the cliffhanger! I cannot wait to get my hands on the next in the Throne of Glass series!
The Fault in Our Stars is not a cancer book. Yes, it features 16 year olds with cancer, but that is not what this book is essentially about. The topic of cancer is important in the sense that it was used to drive the story and its characters, and if anything, it only got us  as readers  more easily attached to them. It shaped the characters into who they are and what they become and it made us, the readers, more emotionally invested in them. You know whats going to happen from the very first page, but it is no less heartbreaking when it does. Hazel is a 16 year old who loves reading, trashy TV, her family and ultimately Augustus. Hazel has terminal thyroid cancer which has taken over her lungs to the point where an oxygen tank becomes a permanent accessory. During one of the weekly cancer support groups, she meets Augustus  a 16 year old who has lost his leg in a battle with a malignant leg tumor. Together, these two characters had the most incredible blend of sarcastic wit and literary conversations that there was absolutely no getting away from it  I fell in love. I knew I was going to have a major book crush on Augustus when he immediately, upon being introduced to Hazel, told her she was beautiful and looked like Nathalie Portman from V for Vendetta. That crush got bigger when he complained about the wrong use of the word literally. Death is a theme in this book, losing people you know or love, dealing with it then moving on. It makes you think about the courage it takes to move on after a parent loses his or her child, about the life youve spent, about how much you have left of it, about the value of living it to the fullest. The characters were so real, as John Green usually makes them, that I had to put the book down several times and just breathe and remind myself that they werent. And even though they might not be real, the situation definitely is. This book made me laugh, it made me think, and it made me cry in huge heaving sobs of despair and heartbreak. I knew what was going to happen, but it still shocked me to no end. It all felt so unfair, so unreal...I almost wanted to write Green an email ranting to him about his choice of plot twist. When I finished the book  very late at night  I literally curled up in bed and sobbed into my pillow. I could relate to the heartbreak, because I have personally been through it. Thank you John Green for being such a great writer. Thank you for giving us such great material to read and reminding us of the value of life in every book you write. I cannot recommend this book enough to people  and no, not only Young Adults fans. Im ending this with something a reviewer said that I could not agree with more, thank you, John Green, for ruining the next few books I read.
FIVE Stop being alive, and start living. STARS! I canNOT describe how good this books is, I was so unprepared for it. I more than loved it! One of the best books Ill probably read this year, what a great way to start the first month of 2016!?! Absofuking lutely stunning storry Homeless, hungry and desperate enough to steal, Doe has no memories of who she is or where she comes from. The ending of this story really messed me up. I was speechless, staring into space and asking myself What on earth just happened. This is a book that makes you feel and sympathise with all characters in it, I found myself questioning everything and trying to really see what the outcomes might be. My mind went into overdrive. So many emotions were running through my mind and I dont know how to describe them all. A notorious career criminal just released from prison, King is someone you dont want to cross unless youre prepared to pay him back in blood, sweat, puy or a combination of all three. This is my first read from T.M. Frazier and I really wasnt expecting to love the authors writing style so much. I was jumping into this book with closed eyes and what a read it turned out to be...beyond amazing. Because when it comes to me and mine, I am the judge. I am the jury. And if need be, I am the motherfucking executioner. Branty King has had a rough life since he was a little boy, however he made friends with a kid, Samuel aka Preppy who unexpectedly was living a similar life. They made a plan literally for their future and how to get away from all their demons. It was tough and rough, however they made it work, they had each others backs and managed to stay alive long enough. This leads me to another thing that I loved about this book and that was this unbreakable frienship between King and Preppy. In all the time Id been living on the streets, Ive had some close calls, some serious gut check moments. Ive seen things that have made my skin crawl and my heart race. I was very familiar with feeling afraid. And then there is Doe, or Pup, with no money, no I.D. and no memory. As anyone, who has read this book, I felt the desperation and struggle that this character was going through, even though I have no idea what it must feel like to have no memory of who you are. Despite that she was so strong and smart mouthed and that made me love this character so so much. She was fierce and that, readers, is what got King so head over heels for her. I loved the story, it made me laugh, it made me cry and most definitely made me feel for Doe, King and last but not least Preppy. T.M. Frazier knows exactly how to hook her readers from the start and have them ask for more. Were not just going to have a life, remember? Were going to live.
Reviewed by: Hello Beautiful Book Blog Great wrap up for this duology. Renee Ahdieh has a writing style all her own boasting rich characters and a rich setting that will have you wanting more. I think I liked it so much because it was something I had never read before. It was new and fresh. That is what really grabbed my attention. The story has a richness that I have never felt before. Everything from the setting to the characters. The characters are formal and unique. The dialect used between characters works well with the story. I loved that it felt authentic to the story. Two stubborn lovers, protecting each other from the very same threat. I got hints of Aladdin in a lot of this book. The magic carpet, that weird temple thing, and some parts of the story to name a few. There was more action in this book for sure. The curses and magic were something I really enjoyed. I was kind of just going through this book without speculating too much because I really had no idea what to expect. Thats pretty unusual for me. I always try to figure out plots and characters beforehand, but not in this book. I just experienced everything as it was happening and I think that made me like it that much more. There were a couple of twists that I really didnt see coming. They were done pretty well. That is not the way of it. Your future is not set in stone, my dearest star. A coin turns on itself a number of times before it lands. I have to mention one part that had my heart swooning and that was when Shazi sees Khalid again. I felt their love for each other much more in this book than I did with the first. They felt more committed or atleast I noticed it more. They almost seemed a little more grown up. I loved Khalid standing up for Shazi. I felt the mutual respect within their relationships. The love triangle is pretty much laid to rest, which is completely fine with me. It was because they were two parts of a whole. He did not belong to her. And she did not belong to him. It was never about belonging to someone. It was about belonging together. The richness breaks through so much, including the writing in this book. The first almost seemed a little shaky with words, but this book is solid. I think Renee was growing as an artist and I really saw her writing skills showing through in TRATD. From the stars, to the stars. I felt like everything was resolved and I am thankful for that. I love seeing all loose ends tied in a book especially one that has so many questions that needed answering. Great book! Great ending! These are books I will not soon forget!  The Wrath and the Dawn was so unique, I hope it does the ending justice. Dont let me down Shazi! :
Actual rating: This was a really emotional, beautiful story about love, loss, grief and family. Graces relationship with her mother was certainly hard and frustrating to read at time, and for about 80 of this book, I found myself feeling so protective of Grace and wanting to shield her from the hurt I know shed feel because of her mother. I really found myself understanding her feelings towards the situation between her mother and Eva, and let me tell you, I think she was a hell of a lot nicer than I wouldve been in that situation. Grace was such a strong, resilient character who just kept pushing through the hard times and I had a lot of respect for her character. I really loved how sweet the romance was. Grace and Evas banter read so naturally and I found myself rooting for them from their very first meeting on the beach. I loved a lot of the discussions they had; about sexuality, especially bisexuality; but also about race and what it was like for Eva to be biracial. I loved that the girls supported each others interests and didnt push each other too far. We also had an on the page ff sex scene which I dont recall ever reading in a YA book before. I appreciated not only that it wasnt a fadeout type of scene, but also that whilst progressing further sexually, they made sure they were both comfortable with where they were going. The scene before the sex scene was a very emotional scene so Im very glad that consent was given on the page. One thing I would have liked more from this book is for Graces relationship with both Luca and Emmy to have been more fleshed out. Their relationship seemed to be more telling than showing and I didnt like the way Grace treated Luca at times. In saying that, I do understand why she responded the way she did at that the times in which I didnt like the way she treated Luca. Apart from that, I did really like their relationship and wished it had been explored a little more. The only other thing I would change is the length of the book. I felt like the ending was a little bit rushed I think I might have liked an epilogue or something to find out how Graces audition went, how Graces mother is doing and how Evas ballet thing went as well. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this and thought it was a really sweet ff romance that I would certainly recommend. This was a really emotional, beautiful story about love, loss, grief and family. Graces relationship with her mother was certainly hard and frustrating to read at time, and for about 80 of this book, I found myself feeling so protective of Grace and wanting to shield her from the hurt I know shed feel because of her mother. I really found myself understanding her feelings towards the situation between her mother and Eva, and let me tell you, I think she was a hell of a lot nicer than I wouldve been in that situation.

This and other reviews can be found on The Psychotic Nerd MY THOUGHTS I enjoyed the first book in this series, so I was excited to finally dive into this sequel! This book does have middle book syndrome, so its very slowpaced, but I still enjoyed it! This book takes place shortly after the events of Half Bad. Gabriel is currently missing, or dead, and Nathan keeps checking to see if Gabriel has showed up. He also still has to evade the Hunters and to make things even more difficult, hes having trouble controlling his Gift. Oh, lets not forget that he still needs to save Annalise. To top it all off, people now what him to join some kind of Alliance. The leader of the White Witches in Britain have no started to kill all Black Witches in Europe, as well as White Witches that dont agree. The Alliance want to put a stop with it and think Nathan would be a great fighter for the cause. This book is really really slowpaced. Enough happened to keep me interested, but this book was mostly leading up to the next book. Theres a whole lot of planning, deciding, flashbacks, and fighting. Some of it was important, but there werent really huge actionpacked events until the end. The writing and the worldbuilding in this book is great! I know some people dont really like the oddness of some of the writing, but I think its very interesting and unique! As for the world, I love it! Its a very harsh magic system, but I think its very different and, again, I think its very interesting! We dont get to learn a whole lot more about it, though, in this book, but the system is still there. In fact, its becoming even more darker. As for romance, its probably one of the oddest romance Ive ever had in a book, and Ive read hundreds. Gabriel likes Nathan and Nathan likes Annalise. Nathan thinks he only likes Gabriel as a friend. I say thinks because I really like Gabriel and I completely ship them. Annalise is okay, but shes kind of the typical girl character I see in YA. IN CONCLUSION All in all, this book has middle book syndrome, so it is a bit slow, but its still necessary. I love the imagination in this series and this book ended in such a climatic way, that I cant wait to read the next book!
And so its over. I had not planned to read this series yet, less binge read it but I had an impulse and I followed it and I do not regret it. It was fantastic. This is the first time I like a complete cast of characters, and hold not one single thing against not even one of them. I loved Thornes sarcasm and witty comments, but how deep inside he was caring and loved Cress. I loved Cress and how her imaginative and romantic fantasies somehow resemble me, her always wanting to look into the best side of people. I loved Scarlets toughness, how fearless and even stubborn she was, fighting for what she thought was correct. I loved Wolfs and how he built and armor he hid with anger and seriousness, but inside he just needed a little bit of loving to be a sweetheart. I loved Ikos personality, she made me laugh and her naive comments where amazing and hilarious. I LOVED KAI and how he was just trying to make what was better for his country, placing them above him with no second thought and he was brave and kind and aghhhhh just perfect. Winter and Jacin were to characters I liked but not necessarily loved, I just couldnt connect as much as I did with the others, they just appeared in this last book while we had a long long journey with the other ones. And last but not least, out heroin Cinder. She was under so much pressure, she had to go through so much things, she fought, things went wrong, but she persevered, she didnt give up and at last she got what she wanted, acquiring even more invaluable things along the path, gaining so much positive stuff, new friends etc... I of course despised Levana but not that much, I held some respect towards her. To conclude I am just going to say I am really happy with how things ended, this book was action packed, had me in the edge of my seat because, come on, in 823 pages a lot of stuff can go down, right? I am looking forward on reading Stars Above, I want more from this world, this characters, this story. 5 out of five stars.  Now I am going to proceed to tell you my favorite characters and books from this series, from my most favorite to least favorite: Boys: 1. Thorne 2. Kai  he may also be first place, hard devotion to make  3. Wolf 4. Jacin Girls: 1. Cinder 2. Cress 3. Iko 4. Scarlet 5. Winter Books: I am not sure the first place, its almost a tie 1. Winter 2. Cress 3. Scarlet 4. Cinder
After 9 books and 20 short stories, Cassie Clare still manages to amaze me. It took me quite a while to read which isnt really surprising considering how big it is! but I enjoyed every page, as I usually do with Shadowhunter books. I dont usually do long reviews, but I feel that Lady Midnight needs one spoilers ahead. Firstly, the characters. Emma was a great protagonist; I love how strong and fierce she is, and she constantly had me laughing! Julian is one of my favourites, and the way he had to shoulder everything on his own, how he had so many secrets that caused him so much pain especially being in love with Emma, how he was basically a parent of four children at 17 it broke my heart. I hope things get easier from him. I liked all the other Blackthorns too, especially Livvy, and their strong loyalties to each other. Mark surprised me, as I ended up liking him way more than I thought I would. And Christina, who quickly became my favourite character, was kind, brave and pretty much just an awesome person. I feel like I should be able to cope with Cassies plot twists by now, but I still was left gasping and speechless at several points. The reveal that Malcolm was the one behind the murders is still so shocking and kinda sad, and finding out that Kit who I love A LOT was the lost Herondale left me literally lost for words! Im excited to find out more about him in LoS and I also sort of ship him with Ty... is that weird? The relationships were, as usual, complicated and beautiful and heartbreaking. I ship Mark, Emma and Christina with at least two people each! Other than the romantic relationships, I loved the friendship between Emma and Christina in particular why couldnt they be the ones that are Parabatai?!. I love how Cassie uses other books and poems to inspire her stories like how A Tale of Two Cities was such a big part of TID, and the connections the story had with Annabel Lee was so clever and beautifully done. I liked how the chapter names were all from the poem too! I did enjoy the cameo appearances from some of the TMITID characters especially Magnus, Jem and Tessa and the short story A long conversation was amazing. I love that Izzy and Simon are getting married! And that fact that Magnus and Alec now have another kid called Rafael was just perfect. Now to wait another year! sigh.
image error This was a difficult book for me to review. I think my opinion on this one is definitely in the minority, but you cant help how you react to a book. It either excites your soul or it turns you away. And Im sorry to say that this one did not excite my soul. Honestly, the plot itself had merit. And I think could have been much more interesting told from a different angle. For example, if it had been told in Remys POV instead of Brookes, I think I would have had a totally different response. But I have to admit that being in Brookes head... was TORTURE for me. This has to be the horniest woman on the planet. I mean really!!!! We get it!!!!! The guy gets you hot... but the constant overly exaggerated descriptive rantings about how her body was reacting to him... even down to the cellular level... I just wanted to shoot myself after a while. I mean how many of you actually describe your own skin as creamy white. And if I had to read the words liquid heat and clenching womb one more time I was going to go bat shit crazy!!!! That said, I have to mention Remington Tate. Now he was a very intriguing character for me. Even though he was quite lacking on the dialogue, you could really see that he had a lot more going on in his head that he wanted to share. I loved his tortured past, and his bipolar flaws.. very interesting character indeed. I would have LOVED to hear this story from his point of view. I know he was almost animalistic in his alpha behavior, but honestly, I think a lot of that was just how our dramatic Brooke viewed him. Yes he was possessive, yes he was aggressive and dominant. He also liked to scent and lick a lot...but then again... that was Brookes description. I also liked the way he searched his music for ways to express his feelings. There was definitely a complicated soul underneath all of that muscle. I would have definitely like to explore that angle a bit more. I cant say I completely disliked the book... because I really did like the storyline. But Im begging the author... if you write a sequel..please do it from Remys POV!!!! The epilogue was blissfully pleasant to read in comparison to Brookes horny rantings!!!! Im sadly only giving this one 2.5 stars : 1 star for Brooke 4 stars for Remy!! My pics...

Its hard to review the final book in a series without giving away spoilers so I wont go into too many details, but I will say that Marissa Meyer exceeded every single one of my expectations! Her smooth way of weaving together intricate story lines is just mind blowing. Although there is so much going on, theres never any confusion in the plot and Meyers writing so easily plays out in your mind like a movie. This entire series was filled with heart stopping moments and Winter was definitely no exception. Throughout Winter the crew is split up into different groups and although I loved keeping up with them all, my favorite duo was Scarlet and Winter! Their characters are just so polar opposite with Scarlet being rough and no nonsense while Winter is all fluff and bleeding walls. lol you should get that reference if youve read Cress Somehow, them being so different is what makes the two work! I was pleasantly surprised to get quite a few laughs from the unlikely pair. Nobody can question Marissa Meyers talent when it comes to character development. Most booksseries will have the reader rooting for 13 people, but Meyer manages to make you feel 100 connected to 9 characters! That is just not something remotely easy to accomplish. Its crazy to think that a cyborg, an emperor, a farmer, an android, and a mutated halfwolfhalfman just to name a few can all be part of one epic series! Every single one of these characters came such a long way! Its impossible to pick just one favorite character overall, but in this final book we get to really see Cinder shine. She is learning to lead and feel comfortable with who she really is. The girl we all grew to love from Cinder shows us just how far shes come and I dont think Ive ever felt more proud! As I was nearing the end of Winter, it teared me up a little to see her all grown up and ready to take her rightful place. I wanted her to get a happy ending above all. This series completely sneaked up on me. I knew early on that I was really enjoying it, but I dont know the moment it skyrocketed to the top of my favorites list! All I know is that I couldnt sleep the night of November 9th just knowing I would have Winter in my hands the next day. Its filled with such a diverse group of memorable characters that I know Ill constantly think back on. Its sad to see the this story reach its final destination, but I look forward to revisiting it many times in the future! And they all lived happily to the end of their days.
The Raven Boys is a story that is full of fantasy and supernatural occurrences that actually originate from factual, real life beliefs that I actually looked up after finishing the book. However, with this stellar and rich plot, The Raven Boys has a cast of unique, individualistic characters that you cant help but fall a little bit in love with and also be jealous of their friendship and want to be a part of their posse. Four boys, The Raven Boys, the name given to boys who go to Aglionby, the private school for rich kids, are what the story revolves around, along with Blue, the girl that somehow triggers everything around them. I honestly think what landed this book in my top books of 2012 list are the characters, their friendship with each other, and how the four boys, even with their differences and their distinct personalities, mesh so well together and would do anything for each other. Then enters the psychics daughter, Blue. Shes destined to either fall in love or kill one of these four boys, and we find which one at the beginning of the novel. Also, prophecies from all psychics have warned her about kissing the love of her life because with that one kiss, death will do them part. Blue quickly becomes a part of their group and I really liked how there are no lies, deceits, and backstabbing happening between them. Blue ends up getting close to someone but who is NOT the Raven Boy we were promised in the synopsis and that our hearts, well at least mine, has been dying to get them together. But I must warn you, if you are expecting romance to be the leading theme, or even the secondary theme, then you are mistaken. The first theme is most definitely the boys obsession with finding out the ley line click on the link to find out more about Ley Lines and finding the buried one. The second is the friendship between them and how normal life still gets in the way of their quest to unraveling the supernatural that this world does indeed have. Maggies writing was so enchanting in The Raven Boys; I was holding my breath in so many scenes. I also somehow became as obsessed as the boys were in trying to find the ley lines. Also, Gansey, one of the boys, has totally stolen my heart. He was like the father of all the boys. He busted their butts when they werent studying, saved them when they got into fights, and vouched for them when they were going to get kicked out of school or were abused at home. If you are not a fan of The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, then I still urge you to read The Raven Boys. This book is not in the least bit similar to the Shiver series. I honestly wouldnt have guessed for the life of me that the same author wrote both books. I am so glad Maggie has decided to explore her own fascination in ley lines and create such a powerful and memorable novel that had me yearning to get my hands on the second book when the first hasnt even come out yet!
Theres a meme online that reads, That moment when you finish a book, look around, and realize that everyone is just carrying on with their lives... as though you didnt just experience emotional trauma at the hands of a paperback. I read this in hardcover, and while the statement is a little flippant for a book as incredible as this one is, it rings so true for me as I sit on my couch and attempt to digest everything A Little Life has put me through. I cant say that I enjoyed this book. Its very dark, its depressing. There isnt a whole lot of hope in it, and what little hope there is tends to get squashed. But its so beautifully written. Yanagihara manages to weave a long and complex story around four old friends from college though she truly focuses on just two of them throughout their entire adult lives, and make it fascinating and enthralling. I really enjoyed the way in which she would start off a chapter in the books present but seamlessly weave prior events into the narrative until the reader comes back to the thenpresent. She does it so deftly that its in no way jarring, as switches in chronology tend to be. I am literally wrung out now that I have finished this enormous 700 tome, and surprisingly, I do not wish it were any shorter. Yanagihara has made me love and care for these characters to such a degree that I wish I knew them in person, that I wish I could send my condolences to everyone affected by the lives of these boys turned men. I wish I could scoop Jude up and heal him of all his trauma. I wish I could write Harold and Julia a letter and reassure them that they did all they could, that nothing could have stopped the inevitability that happened, but that they did show a broken man what a normal life, being loved and loving in return, could be. I feel as though, over the last few days, I aged 40 years alongside these characters. Its hard to remember that I am still just 36; I feel so much older now. But these are only the characters in a book. They dont exist. But somehow Yanagihara brought me into her world so completely that for the last few days, their New York was more real to me than my home and my reality here in Rhode Island. And the cover... I dont usually fawn over covers, but its so very expressive, and every time I see it my heart breaks all over again. I cant tell you to read this book; there are a whole lot of triggers in this book that may make it very difficult for people to read substance abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental abuse, abuse of a child, selfharm, suicide attempts. But this book has changed me. It is truly a literary masterpiece, and one I hope will achieve the awards and recognition it deserves. Well done, Ms. Yanagihara.
The word amazing isnt enough to describe The Sea of Tranquility. The story unfolds and you just fall in love with these characters who are broken and in time mend themselves together, or try to at least. At first when I read the book, I thought it was going to be a good, light, lovehate read, but it was that and so much more. The Sea of Tranquility made me feel things, when Nastya hurt, I was hurt, when she was surprised, I was surprised, when she laughed, I laughed. The end of third chapter threw me for a loop. I didnt get it at first, the story is written so well that it concealed something very important, which of course is revealed. Natsya dropped hints of what demons she lives with day in and day out. Its terrible what has happened to her and by the middle of the book, we have enough to piece together some of the horrific details. The story switches back and forth through Natsya and Joshs POV. Josh lives a hard life, he really does, without the Leighton family, he would pretty much be alone. Natsya basically forces herself in this force field that he has created himself, which is difficult because they both have their guard on. They dont want to let the other one in, but theyre so drawn to each other, that its inevitable. Josh really transforms and he opens himself so much to her and doesnt know if he should regret the simple expectations that have implanted themselves into his everyday life. Drew is a character that gets to you, I thought I had him pegged in the beginning book, I really did. I just didnt know how his role was going to play out or how significant he would be, but I fell in love with him too. I dont want to give anymore away, but really, I just cant stop replaying scenes in my head. Remembering those special moments they shared make me smile, Im really big on wishes. I read the book at 11 PM last night, slept around 4:30 AM, woke up around 9:30 AM and didnt stop reading until I was finished which was around 11:30 AM. I absolutely love this book, I was not frustrated at all with the mystery surrounding both characters. The story was well paced and flowed incredibly well, even when situations were rocky, you read through them and experienced what the characters experienced. The Sea of Tranquility had everything you could hope for in a contemporary romance. The last two words of dialogue are what get me. I went full circle and I cried happy tears. The Sea of Tranquility will stay long with you after youve read the last page. Youll want to go back, reread highlighted or dogeared pages and fall in love all over again. Believe me, after I collected myself, I immediately went on Goodreads and starting liking all of my favorite quotes. You might also be itching to bake something or eat some ice cream. I really cant wait to read more by Katja Millay.
The Martian is a standalone novel written by author Andy Weir. In my opinion, there is not a set genre for this book. Sure it is said to fall into the science fiction category, but its more like fictional science. This sounds like a criticism but its not! The science is real and I dont question the accuracy of the details. But it is first and foremost a science book that happens to take place in a fictional storyline. Im a science girl, so even though I was eating up all the technical stuff, I was still caught off guard at the sheer amount of it given the fiction marketing. However, its so encouraging to see how readers are responding to this book. And now its being adapted to film! I loved the main character, Mark Watney who gets stranded on Mars. Mr. Weir writes his character with smartass, laidback humor that made the book feel a bit dark at times given the likelihood of his death at every turn. These factors of course made me eager to research the author a bit to see his inspiration for this story. Mr. Weirs website reveals the following: Biography:ANDY WEIR was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since. He is also a lifelong space nerd and a devoted hobbyist of subjects like relativistic physics, orbital mechanics, and the history of manned spaceflight. The Martian is his first novel. Inspiration for The Martian:I was thinking up how best to do a manned Mars mission because thats the sort of dork I am. As the plan got more detailed, I started imagining what it would be like for the astronauts. Naturally, when designing a mission, you think up disaster scenarios and how likely the crew would be to survive. Thats when I started to realize this had real story potential. Overall, I really liked The Martian and would recommend it to readers who enjoy a mixture of space science, survival stories, comedy, and 1970s entertainment just trust me. Enjoy! My favorite quote: If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that its found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just dont care, but theyre massively outnumbered by the people who do. The film adaptation will be directed by Ridley Scott and will feature an impressive cast lead by Matt Damon. Check out these movie stills: 05302015: More movie stills!
Im glad I finally read this one! This is close to 4 stars so Ill definitely be rounding up. After so much of the forbidden love trope, I adore the idea of books where two people who are supposed to fall in love, actually do. This is such a fun example of that. While it took me more time to warm up to Dimple than Rishi, who was totally my type of guy from the start, I could also understand her dedication to her studies and her complete freak out when she met Rishi. I cant even fathom my parents having tried to set me up for marriage when I was 18 and going to college. Speaking of that, I love the way this book wove in Dimple and Rishis Indian heritage and culture through this book and within their lives in California. I really liked the way both of their parents are part of their lives, but it was also rewarding watching Dimple and Rishi begin to forge their own paths forward too. That struggle is such a relatable and true part of that transition from life in high school and at home to college and out in the world. I had so much fun watching Dimple and Rishi fall for each other through the course of their 6 weeks at Insomnia Con. Despite how different they seem at first, these two really get each other. And so much of this book was the sweet and swoony building of first love. Rishi is the best date planner, btw. However, where the story fell a for me was in the Big Break section. I never like that part of a book, but I found what happened here to be extra frustrating I also lost a lot of the warm feelings Id had for Dimple after that point. Although I cannot relate to the pressure she was perceiving from her parents to pick marriage or a career, she was so incredibly mean in how she handled the whole thing. Instead of communicating she was selfish and unkind as Rishi said. I had trouble getting back the warm fuzzies at the conclusion after all of that. . But still, overall this is a fantastic book and I totally get why everyone is praising it so much! Love Triangle Factor: NONE Cliffhanger Scale: standalone. A companion book from Rishis brothers POV is to come in the future.
Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you dont live to see the morning? In the ruins of a place one known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteenyearold Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sisters place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to death beforeand survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. The Hunger Games is already a very well known name in the YA world, and for very good reason. It is a fantastic novel that, from the first page, draws you in. Each page holds its own adventure. The entire novel is suspense: whats going to happen? Who will die? Even in the last few pages, I was still so caught up in what was going on. My favorite part about this book wasnt necessarily the characters or the plot although I LOVED both of those. It was actually the fact that, while reading it, I felt so many different emotions that it was overwhelming. When a book can actually make me feel the same way that the characters feel, thats when I know its a fantastic novel. Suzanne Collins gives us no mercy with The Hunger Games. There are fights to the death, and they are gory. But thats just yet another fantastic aspect of this book. Its real and gritty. And Katniss. Holy crap. I bow down to her. She. Is. Badass. Thats honestly all I have to say about her. Her sheer awesomeness can only be experienced through reading The Hunger Games. I couldnt possibly begin to explain why I loved her as our main character. She is one of the toughest, most badass chicks in YA. An absolute must read for anyone. Young, old, boy, girl, whatever and whoever you are. Pick up The Hunger Games!
I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS AND NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW BRILLIANT THIS BOOK WAS. Full review: Expect a lot of caps lock in this review. This is what my immediate reaction was upon finishing this book and what I wrote as my Goodreads review: I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS AND NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW BRILLIANT THIS BOOK WAS. Im still struggling to find the words to describe how much I loved this follow up to last years The Young Elites which I also LOVED. Its rare that I read a sequel that I find to be completely up to par with the first book, but this was. Plus, its darker and more devious and delightfully delicious. I devoured it and this ones not even out yet but I CANT WAIT FOR THE THIRD BOOK. I got chills after the two pages. Thats the mark of a book that pulls you in immediately and doesnt want to let you go. I swear, if I had not had to go to work, I wouldve read it straight through, and do YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS TO GO TO WORK? Weve got to talk about Adelina, of course. Man, do I love her. Shes fierce, dark, strong, and decidedly stubborn. And in The Rose Society she takes it a step farther. She isnt afraid to get what she wants, to fight for revenge, to be mean if she has to and bitter and tough. I love her. Its refreshing to read about a main character who is, well...a little evil. Shes losing her mind somewhat, and that downward spiral is captivating. This book will break your heart and make you crave more of it. And that ending. No spoilers, but its both deliciously satisfying and slightly enraging in that I NEED MORE NOW. Im so pumped that my teens chose The Young Elites for our November book club read at the library. Even though I was obviously obsessed with this one, this one felt more slowburning than The Young Elites which was packed to the brim with action. I liked the focus on Adelinas mental state, but I think TYE was a little more intense, if that makes sense. The bottom line: If my review isnt enough for you, Im not sure how else to get my point across. READ THIS SERIES. You wont be disappointed. In fact, youre probably going to be completely enthralled, put under a spell that you wont want to break.
What more can I say? I fucking LOVED The Saint, pardon my french. Like seriously, I thought that I couldnt love Father Soren Stearns any more, and then theres this! I loved: The Cabin Scenes There is a certain person that meets Nora in a remote cabin, and they share a few intimate days together. I liked that interaction, but more, Nora loves everyone, and you can see some of that here. Soren Oh GOD! I loooovvvvveeeee him!!!!!!!!!!!! Every word of the flashback scenes The flashback scenes are similar to the ones that we got in The Mistress, but the story is from the POV of teenage Elle, and the beginning of her relationship with Soren. I get butterflies just thinking about it. The flashbacks are absolutely one of my favorite parts of the series. Soren Little One, to be with me is to hurt. To be with out you would hurt more. You wont scare me off. Im not afraid of you. If I had something valuable, Id lock it up. He smiled at her. I plan to. Teenage Nora From reading The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty in church, to getting arrested, young Elle was very entertaining! I would read her POV forever. Do you have any idea what it is you have between your legs? she demanded. Im well aware of what it between my legs. He said the words without even breaking a smile. The Sex Scene Between Soren and Nora I didnt care for: Not enough Kingsley : There were very few scenes featuring the King and I would have liked about 100 more, though we got to read and learn more about Nora and Sorens relationship. I just cant get enough of him! The trickery Id like to say a bit more about it, but will not ruin the book. I will say that the hints at the beginning of the book ATE at me, and I would not put the book down until I figured out what was going on. I was about to go stabby on Tiffany sorry, but luckily I made it through to the end and could breathe easy. The lingering questions I still had questions from the bombshell that was given to us from the ending of The Mistress.. I think that the surface was grazed on most of them, but just not enough for me. Overall it was amazing. Ive already read it twice! TWO TIMES it is that good! I cant wait for the next book!!
The Lunar Chronicles is getting better with every book. Cress was just fantastic. It has so much movement, from action to backstories, surprises to romance, humor to adventure and absolutely amazing world building. The introduction of new characters has made the overall plot all the more intriguing. I am simply amazed by how Marissa Meyer has interlaced these different fairy tale retellings into an imaginative and incredible scifi story. A very creative recount of Rapunzel, Cress introduces us to a sixteen year old Lunar girl who has been a prisoner on a satellite since childhood, imprisoned by Queen Levanas thaumaturge Sybil Mira. Being a genius hacker, Cress does all the spying and hacking for the Lunar Queen. For the past seven years shes only had her netscreens as company. She is absolutely fascinated by everything Earthen. As a character I found Cress to be adorable. Yes, she is idealistic and naive but that is totally believable in her situation.Also, it was a complete delight reading about Captain Carswell Thorne. He is such a well built persona, hilarious and brave; maybe a bit too selfobsessed but totally lovable. The romance between him and Cress is just so sweet. I also found the desert scenes extremely touching, though a bit rough. The overall plot has really picked up, and the story is moving with a breakneck speed. Emperor Kai is still struggling to save his country from Levanas wrath and he has all my sympathies. Cinder is making progress with her powers, confidence and plans to overthrow the Lunar Queen. We see more of Dr Erland in this book. Wolf and Scarlet have a considerable role to play too and it was endearing to see how their relationship progresses. We are also introduced to Princess Winter, though very briefly and I cant wait to read her story and know more about her. A fair share of surprises and revelations keep coming throughout the book which maintains the excitement. There is a lot of action and drama towards the end and it was really nice to see Cinder and Kai together. I know they have a long way to go, but at least Kai got a few answers from Cinder, who though still conflicted, seems to be a bit more comfortable with her powers and being Princess. I keep saying this, but its admirable how effortlessly Marissa Meyer has built up a massive plot, entwining numerous characters and giving a new life to our beloved fairy tales. Cant wait to get my hands on Fairest and Winter. This is turning out to be an extremely enjoyable and fun series to read.
The Keeper: 3.5 Stars It was interesting reading from Michelle Benoits point of view, especially since we didnt really get to hear too much from her, just about her, in Scarlet. Glitches: 3.5 Stars If its possible to dislike Adri any more that I already did, I do. Thats probably why I didnt like it as much as some of the other ones in the book. She and Pearl always annoy me and listening to how awful she is to Cinder isnt what I want to read about. The Queens Army: 4 Stars Wolfe was always one of my favorite characters, and so it was extremely interesting to hear what his life was like a little before joining the Army. The part at the end of it where he was going against Alpha Brock was very intense! Carswells Guide to Being Lucky: 5 Stars I love Thorne. I wish Thorne was real so much! His personality, his attitude, everything about him is the best! And hearing about his life way before Cinder and the gang was extremely interesting. It makes you love him even more. I love that he wanted a real cat, but he was okay with his android cat Boots. After Sunshine Passes: 3 Stars Im not a fan of Cress until she starts to stand up for herself in Winter, so listening to a part of the story where she is a scared, quiet shell again is hard. I mean, I definitely understand why shes naive, but it is annoying. The Princess  the Guard: 4 Stars Aside from Thorne and Cress, Winter and Jacin are my favorite couple. It was heart breaking listening to how everything has effected her: the death of her father, saving the servant, the servant dying, still recovering from the loss of Celine, thinking she lost Jacin, and suffering from Lunar Sickness. This girl needs a hug! The Little Android: 2 Stars I just didnt care for this one. I guess because Cinder only played a minor role in it, and none of the other characters mentioned were people Ive read about, so there was no connection formed. It just wasnt my thing. The Mechanic: 4 Stars I loved hearing Kais opinion of Cinder from first meeting her! It sounds like they have always meant to be together, even before they knew it! Something Old, Something New: 5 Stars What can I say? Im a cheeseball when it comes to weddings! I am so happy that Scarlet and Wolfe got married. I feel like out of all the couples, they deserve it. I mean, I love all the couples together, but I think Cress needs to live some more before her and Thorne get married, and Winter and Jacin need some time of Winter not being crazy before they get married. And Kai and Cinder have been busy running their own countries, so I totally get them not being married...yet. It was so wonderful to go back to this world and read about some of my favorite characters! I loved them so much!
I have waited two years and eleven months for Isla and the Happily ever after to come out. Many had been waiting longer than that, but it still felt like a lifetime waiting to be able to read the book. I was deeply impressed with Stephanies first two books in this series even though they are better defined as companions I couldnt get over how great Anna and Lola were. I was hoping Isla would continue down the path of everything I loved about the first two books in its own way.. but I was sadly let down by this book. I feel like this book had a much different feel than the rest of the series. While that isnt always a negative thing, I do feel like it had a negative impact on me. I was so use to the quirky and fun feeling that we got from Anna and Lola was turned into a really serious feeling and Isla. Trust me when I say that I get where Stephanie was going with this. It does work for what she wanted to accomplish in the story, but for me, I felt like it took so much away from what I loved so much about the first two books. I didnt feel like the relationship was all that great in this book either. It didnt feel as real as the other two relationships we have seen. Personally, I really liked Isla. But any situation she was in involving Josh, I was really not into. I felt like their relationship was somewhat forced. Josh on his one, much like Isla, was a decent character but I was really hoping for a lot more when it came to their relationship with each other. Its definitely hard for me to discuss why I didnt like this book, because as I said above, the first two books are incredible. I was hoping for something amazing, especially since it took so long for this book to make its way to readers, but I was honestly disappointed with how it turned out. I understood the path Stephanie was trying to take, but I really couldnt get over how different this book felt and how much it was missing that made me love the first two books so much. If you have read Anna and Lola, I am going to leave it up to you when it comes to reading this one. Maybe you will love Isla, or maybe you will feel the way I do. I know many people that have read the book loved it, but I just feel like there is so much missing. Will I read more books by Stephanie in the future? Absolutely. I just wish this one had lived up to what I was hoping for it to be for the past several years.
6 Stars!! This isnt going to be a typical review for me. I do not want to recap the events or even describe the characters too much because I wont be able to do them justice. Please believe me when I say that it is better to go in completely blind. You will not be disappointed! Im also going to be honest and tell you that I was left a blubbering mess by the time I finished this book. I was almost stunned speechless by the impact of this story and the depth of emotion it brought out of my heart and my memories. It Ends with Us is a devastatingly honest and brutally emotional story to read. It is also the very best book I have ever read by Colleen Hoover maybe even ever, ever. I do not believe you can categorize It Ends with Us as a typical romance novel due to the fact that so many people will have a visceral reaction to the story. I know for a fact that I did. My heart was in my throat for much of the book and I couldnt stop thinking about it for days after I finished reading. This story has sharp barbs and they will grab ahold of your heart and leave a piece of themselves behind long after it ends. If you have ever read a book by Colleen Hoover, you know that she weaves multiple themes and layers into each of her stories. It Ends with Us is no different, but it feels so much deeper and more personal this time around. What may seem like coincidental or accidental truly isnt and all of the subtle threads will start to come together to make you realize that the words on the pages are only a small part of the whole picture. I implore you to read this without seeking spoilers as this is a story that truly needs to be experienced firsthand. Even if you have never been personally affected by the subject matter contained within It Ends with Us, I believe every person who reads this book will be touched in some way or another. It will challenge your beliefs, it will give a voice to impossible situations, and it will remind you that it is ok to ask for help. I applaud Colleen for her honesty and her bravery to put this story out into the world. I believe that it will give empower and encourage everyone who reads it, for it is a story with both honest perfection and a powerful message.

Okay, heres the thing. This is a PLAY. It give you news of what has happened to Harry and most of his friendsfamily, much as Jo Rowling has given us news of them via Pottermore and other places over the past decade or so. What it is not, not, NOT is another Harry novel, and as such it is bound to disappoint. Not only have I read the Harry books repeatedly since they first came out in the US in 1999, but I have listened to them multiple times as read by Jim Daleand Jim Dale reading Harry is far, far better than any of the movies, especially the last 34! The more I readlisten to them, the more I am impressed both by the structure developed over the series small, seemingly insignificant incidents often meant more than they seemed, and come back as important parts of the last few books, and by Rowlings skill as a writer. As in bringing a world vividly to life through language and characterization. A play is a whole different thing. It can bring turn the characters into 3 dimensional beings on a stage, but it does not allow for description, for narrative. That nameless narrator, who brought us Harrys voice in what I think would be termed a third person limited style, is missing in the play. We dont have the voice in our head, or Jim Dales voice, setting the scene, letting us see what Harry sees and feels. As a result, this book will seem bare and colorless to those who read it. I expected that it would. And I am, as always, pissed off beyond belief at the marketers who shamelessly exploit the popularity of this series with midnight sellings, and release rules that would impress Homeland Security. When a library has to sign secrecy agreements, keep processed copies locked in bins until after midnight on Sunday, its just nonsense. If this was a true 8th book I would understand the Harry mania, and accept it to a point. And I am sad that Rowling allowed the play, but then didnt do a true book based on it, or at least some sort of novelization. I know she has been working on Fantastic Beastsand Im glad shes done the script for that herselfand on her excellent books as Robert Galbraith, but I think that her fans deserve more, especially kids whose parents are forking out so much money for this. I read it. Im glad to know whats happened with Harry and Company. But worth the hype, the secrecy, the fuss? Nope, nope, and nope.
Every so often I come across an author who simultaneously has the power to make me smile like a blissful school girl and also sob my eyes out in the pits of despair. Leigh Bardugo is one of these. At some point Ill manage the willpower to review all three of the Grisha Trilogy her first series in her fantasy world and my first introduction to her ability to wreck me beyond belief but for now, I want to focus on her newest book and the one to most recently destroy my emotions, SIX OF CROWS. This book. THIS BOOK, yall. Bardugo has an amazing ability to weave character and story and setting and plot into this masterful creation that flat engulfs you from the first moment you open the book on to the very last page. None of these characters are heroes in the traditional sense; lets be real  theyre on a mission to kidnapsteal someone from another country. None of them are angels. But they are so, utterly, real. Not every writer can make me believe so wholeheartedly in a fantasy character, magically inclined or otherwise, but Bardugo manages it. I was cheering on this ragtag band of miscreants for the entirety of the book and all the twists and turns of loyalty, betrayal, and action that were thrown at us. Each of their six respective POVs felt as fleshed out as the others, something that is so, so hard to manage with multiple POVs, in my opinion. In particular, Kazs backstory completely fascinated me, as did Inejs deep rooted desire for freedom. I absolutely ship them, by the way ; As far as the story arc, it blew me away with how wellcrafted it was. The plot was definitely complicated enough to keep my attention, but I was never confused about what was going on, if that makes sense? Bardugo did a great job keeping me intrigued enough to keep reading without kicking me out of the narrative due to too much going on. I am so totally looking forward to seeing how the plot continues on into the sequel, as well. I need to know what happens next, yall, and really thats about the highest compliment I think I can give! Basically, Ive got the released date for the sequel, CROOKED KINGDOM highlighted and circled in red on my calendar. It may have taken me a few months to dive into SIX OF CROWS, but Ive learned my lesson and will be waiting by the mailbox for my preorder in September. Dont expect to hear from me for a few days  I do read fast again, I finished SIX OF CROWS in a single evening, but I daresay Ill need a day or two to recover from epic levels of a book hangover. crossposted to my blog
This review was originally posted on unConventional Bookviews The Problem With Forever gave me all the feels, and it took me a while to be able to actually write a full review  no coherence for days. I love NA novels that make me sad, angry, happy  sometimes all at the same time. The Problem With Forever really rose to the occasion and made my heart break more than once, and I cried, laughed and cheered. I also screamed a bit  especially at Mallorys adoptive dad  because characters did or said stuff they really shouldnt have. Mallory and Rider sighs they have been through so much darkness and abuse, its truly amazing they can function and have any kind of hope at all. They were in the same foster home until something really bad happened, and Mallory was taken to the hospital, where she was later adopted by two doctors. And then she was homeschooled, because for the longest time, she didnt talk. At all. Because she had to be as quiet as possible in her foster home, just to stay safe from her foster dads explosive anger. Rider and Mallory tried their best to take care of each other when they were children, and after they were separated, they both thought they wouldnt ever see each other again. And this was true until Mallory started high school for her senior year so she could get ready for college. The Problem With Forever captured the way both Mallory and Rider had been lost without each other, and how strong their bond was because they had grown up in the same sad and dark situation. I loved seeing them get to know each other again, and I especially loved the character development that showed Mallory transform from Mouse to a young woman who was able to stand up for herself and use actual words to do so. The Problem With Forever touched my heart in all the right ways, and just thinking about it  I finished reading it over a week ago  makes my chest heavy all over again. Armentrout truly outdid herself here, both with the story, and the characters. I was captivated from page one. I nodded as my heart turned into a gooey mess. He actually remembered that I drank milk every chance I got  that and Cokes, when Rosa and Carl let me get away with it. Page wasnt lurking by my locker Thrusday morning. Jayden was as I switched out my books. An act of God held up his baggy jeans. That faint earthy smell clung to is Ravens Tshirt. What I was lacking wasnt thinner thighs or a flatter stomach. It was courage. The fat was, I was a giant scaredycat. how could I bet thinking about a guys lips when I couldnt even get mine to work to form words?
OK! OK Colleen Hoover! Just OK! I know, I know. I know what to expect when I read one of your amazing books. I know to expect some tears and all of the feels. I know you are going to surprise me, hurt me, and then put me back together. But I wasnt prepared for this kind of abuse. I just wasnt. I felt blindsided with this book. This wasnt your usual method of operation and I hate you for it. I love you too, but still I hate you. Because you took my sweet unsuspecting reader heart, you held it in your hands carefully and then threw it on the ground, stomped all over that bad boy and shoved it with back into my chest. And you did it over and over and over again. Thats what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them. It can save them. You made me love someone that I shouldnt. You made me question something that I always thought I knew. You made me question wether I would leave. Its a funny to thing to learn that you could be a weak woman while reading a Colleen Hoover novel. The kind of woman you despise. Because she isnt strong enough to make the right decisions. Because you made me love him that much. You made me root for him stupidly. You made me hope he would change. You made me sympathize so badly for him that I thought for sure love could save him. And I am just so pissed about it. And I am damn uncomfortable. It is an awful feeling and I dont like it one bit. Just because someone hurts you doesnt mean you can simply stop loving them. Its not a persons actions that hurt the most. Its the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear. But in the end I had to give this one 5 Stars and that is because I believe in my heart that the author wanted me to feel this way. It was intentional. She wanted to make me question everything that I ever thought I knew about the subject matter at hand. She wanted me to want to stay. She wanted me to struggle along with Lily. And I kinda hate Colleen Hoover right now but I will get over it because I am pure crap at holding a grudge and because this story was brilliant, thought provoking, and heart breaking just as she intended. And I am seriously hoping one day, I wont be so angry about it all. Just keep swimming, Amie
This is not an average book, and I know that many people will read it, and have different feelings about it, but this book is one of a kind. The kind of book that breaks the mold of your thoughts on several different topics; what teenagers should act like, the things cancer patients should joke about, if you had one wish how would you spend it? What happens when your hero turns out to be a disappointment, and the real hero was always around. This is not a book about cancer, or about death. This is a book about love and life. It is about two people who fall into love in the most organic of ways under the most inorganic of circumstances. This is a story that is so great, that I want it to remain just mine forever, I wish I was the only one who ever read it, because Hazel and Augustus deserve to be so much more than just characters in a book. They are timeless, theyre story one that bears the marks that none before can ever bear, and none after will ever bear. In these pages is a love that is so simple, and easy and at the same time so complex and difficult, it is a love that cant be categorized, but one that can only be experienced. I loved every character in this book, because they were all so real. So real that I wanted to go friend them on facebook ASAP. But they were also all very far from perfect yes even Augustus Waters had faults he played that Prince of Dawn game way too much. And thats what I loved. This story was far from perfect. But in all its imperfections was several instances of perfect love, perfect friendship, perfect parenting, perfect grief. I want to ramble on about every single sentence of this book, but I cant because it would be doing it an injustice. I have to say that I came to understand and appreciate so much about the life that I have, and I have come to see the metaphors out there thanks to Augustus. I was trying to find my favorite quotes but there were so many. So I chose these three because I think they sum up the essence of this book. Its a metaphor, he said. You choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances . . . I said. Oh, yes. He smiled. The big, goofy, real smile. Im a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. My thoughts are stars I cant fathom into constellations. If youre looking for typical, dont bother picking up this one. But if you want a chance at being a spectator to one of the greatest love stories I have ever read, pick up this book. Thanks Angie for pressuring me into reading this one
I really didnt know what to expect when I started this book. The synopsis sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try. And god I dont regret it! The action started right on the first page, though I have to admit I had some issues understanding the world and the relationships between the characters at first. But soon I became completely fascinated by this world! It reminds me so much of Aladdin fav Disney movie ever. Ahdieh describes everything  the food, the clothes, the palace  in such great detail, you definitely get the feeling that she knows what shes talking about. Another thing I absolutely adored about this book are the two main characters Shahrzad and Khalid. I couldnt really identify with Shazi at the beginning, but the more I read the more I fell in love with her. She has everything I want from a good main character: she is confident without being vain, she is independent and knows what she wants and she doesnt shy away from sassy and sarcastic remarks  even in front of a Chaliph. The King of Kings himself turned out to be one of my absolute favorites. But well I expected that, I have a thing for dark and twisted antiheroes. The two have great chemistry, although I feel like their romance was a bit rushed. I would have enjoyed an even more slowburning romance a lot more! I also adored Jalal and Despina?! They are so well written characters, I really hope they get a bit more attention in the second book! Well then we also have characters like Tariq and Shahrzads father. I just cant bring myself to like them. I dont know if the reader is supposed to dislike them but to me they seem a bit selfish. And Shazis father is just creepy. There I said it. The plot in general was enjoyable. There were no real plot twists, the only thing that you could call a plot twist was kinda predictable in my opinion. But still the story was exciting and especially the ending made me curious! This book may not become one of my favorites but I still enjoyed it immensely! The world is magical and unique and the characters are very complex and interesting which makes it easy to care about them. If youre looking for a diverse read with a romance that is not too cheesy and a well written antihero then I can certainly recommend this one!
I hate to say it, because I see so many of my friends loved the book, but I am disappointed. Its not that I dont like the book, its just that I liked the first book, You, so much better and because of that I had high expectations going in. In You, Joes dark side was made apparent in the narration. You could see where, from the outside looking in, he seemed like a perfectly normal guy, but we could all see through the story that his mind was warped, and he was always a hurt feeling away from adding to his body count. In Hidden Bodies I didnt get that same feeling. Joe the serial killer just didnt add up in the second go around. In this version I was reminded of Dexter. Yeah, he was a serial killer, but we felt like he wasnt really a bad guy because Dexter only killed bad guys and we ended up actually rooting for him. Joe is similar in that I found myself liking him... because in this story he does seem to be a good guy. But hes not. Hes a fucking serial killer, and the story doesnt put two and two together enough for me to come to terms with good guy Joe being a murderer. The only thing I understood was that Joe seemed to mistake love Love for sex, and was too disturbed to understand the difference. Because hey, its something all of us guys went through when we were younger but we didnt all go murdering each other when the love of our life also known as the girl who is putting out when we are that age decides to hop in the sack with someone else. If that were the case the world population would consist of mostly women and a handful of crippled men. When Joe reacted in this one, it didnt seem to come from a scary psychopath as we seen in the first one. His reasoning and reactions just didnt jibe. Also, A lot of what he did in the story was either predictable or didnt make any sense. A few times the direction of the story went into such an unbelievable place that I could only groan in disappointment as I read. Okay, enough with the negative or it will sound like I actually hated the book... which I didnt. Again, I thought the book was good but not great. It wasnt hard to follow and had enough action to keep the reader entertained. I have a feeling we will be seeing a third instillation and this was good enough that I would be interested in continuing the series.
Its hard to review this story without giving anything away so Im going to keep my review vague in an effort not to ruin it for anyone else. Me Before You is a beautiful story about a man who has lost almost everything, and the woman who blows into his life determined to enrich it. After a motorcycle accident paralyzes him from the neck down, Will, the adventurer, loses his ability to continue life as he knows it. Lous life is upended on a much smaller scale when she loses her job and is forced to take a leap of faith and try something new, but Lou doesnt do well with unpredictability. Lou and Will were both fantastic characters. They made it so easy to get lost in this story. Despite their flaws and they both have many, they were likable and spunky. I would go from cheering them on one minute to cursing them the next. They both had strong personalities and were stubborn, and it was entertaining watching them go head to head. This book was definitely character driven. While there are some romantic elements to this story, it takes a backseat to the more serious issues at hand. It was gripping from beginning to end, and my emotions were put through the wringer. This was without a doubt one of the most heartbreaking books Ive ever read, but there was enough humor in there to stop me from feeling completely overwhelmed. I like a book that makes me really think about things, and this book definitely did that. It was hard to pinpoint who was selfish here. Maybe they both were, or maybe neither one of them was. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, Id be thrown for a loop and start rethinking again! There were a lot of things that could be taken away from this book, but for me, there were two things that really stood out. Number one was how powerless we all really are. We never know what is going to happen one moment to the next or how we might react. Will was a man who had everything going for him, and in a split second, it was ripped away. And number two, sometimes all it takes is one person to brighten someone elses day. Lou walked into Wills life, and by simply being herself, she was able to bring him joy. Me Before You is a book that is really going to get you thinking, and its going to stay with you long after youve finished. This review was originally posted at Badass Book Reviews.
Im not trying to play down how terrifying it would be to start over in a new era Im not frightened, he interrupted, only to soften his voice as he continued. How could I be, knowing I had you there? Time travel, pirates, and a love story between two people from completely different centuries; I was in the minute pirates were mentioned. I freaking love pirates. And I really love Nicholas. I would travel through time in search of some stupid astrolabe with him. This book opened up so beautifully, and so intelligently. The silly little details that would otherwise be unimportant in any other book had a huge relevance to the entire adventure. One minute, Etta is preparing for a huge performance at the Met, and the next some weird sound is going off in the distance and shes being pulled by a stranger. She comes across her mentor, Alice, as shes dying. Pretty awesome beginning to a pretty awesome book, right? Unfortunately, it plateaued for me during that horribly long, boring dinner conversation. Maybe the banter was important to the characters, but I was most certainly not interested. Every time I tried to pick this book up and read it and believe me, I tried extremely hard, I could barely get passed a few lines before my mind went off day dreaming about anything but this book and whatever the heck was going on. And I was so incredibly close to hanging up the towel and putting this book on my DNF shelf. Obviously, I didnt, and I am so glad I didnt. Because I easily got lost into Etta and Nicholas growing affection and feelings for each other. Absolutely freaking adorable. I was so jealous of Etta, I have to admit. And before their first kiss, I wanted to jump and kiss him myself. OH AND THEIR FIRST KISS! You call that a kiss? ?!???!!!! I was squealing. And laughing, but mostly squealing. Then in Damascus, when they were going to sleep and Etta basically said screw this, Im taking what I want and what happened next.......... I was not expecting that and it was so sweet, and perfect, and oh, my gosh, do I really need to explain any further how absolutely perfect it was? Then, he was reciting that poem when he thought he wasnt going to make it... oh, man. I want more of their romance in the next book, lots of it!
wow i cant breathe my nose is too filled with snot from my sobbing and my mouth is too busy wailing to inhale so yeah im just dead thats a disgusting way of me saying that this book ripped my heart out, smashed it to bits, tried to glue it back together, but ended up just killing me and slaughtering every ounce of feeling ive ever had ACTUAL REVIEW: This review is painstakingly spoiler free. The Infernal Devices is a series that I hold dearly to my heart. Ive come to care for all of these characters so much, including the newer ones. And even now, my heart still aches in memory of this book and its characters. This book pulled so many emotions from me: happiness, depression, heartache... Name it, and its probably true. The way Cassandra Clare has managed to make me feel about all of these characters is phenomenal. Its difficult to say goodbye to a series you love. And because of this, I purposely took my time reading this final installment, relishing the last chapters ever to be written in this series. As the characters stories wound to an end, I could feel pieces of my heart chipping away. The relationships in this book are just breathtaking. Im not talking just talking about the love triangle though its definitely remarkable. The familial atmosphere and loyalty throughout the London Institute is just so aweinducing. And then theres the friendship between Will and Jem, which is without a doubt the most beautiful and perfect friendship I have ever read about. They are more than just parabatai, they are more than just friends, theyre soul mates in the deepest sense possible. Without the other, one cannot be the same. Theyre two parts of one heart. Every memory of their friendship that is mentioned brought tears to my eyes. Cassandra Clare has written an incredible love triangle in this series. But heres the fault of a good love triangle: the reader ends up caring for both boys, so regardless of the outcome, its always bittersweet. And thats Clockwork Princess in one word, I think. Bittersweet. I love Will Herondale and I love Jem Carstairs. Although Ive been a strong admirer of Will since Clockwork Angel, I have so much more respect for Jem than any other character in this series. James Carstairs is gorgeous, inside and out, and he will forever be one of my favorite literary characters. The romance in this book is intense, and a bit messed up at times, but its perfect in its own way. Rarely have I ever encountered such a perfect conclusion to a fantastic series. But Clockwork Princess has blown my expectations out of the water. Clockwork Princess has made me sob uncontrollably due to its utter perfection. And after reading the last page of the last book in the series, I feel as if something within me is broken and lost. And I think thats the true sign of an amazing series. 5 brilliant keys. Wow. I cannot believe I actually wrote a coherent review of this book. Sophia The Book Basement
Incredibly moving. Achingly beautiful. Awfully upsetting. We Were Liars is one of these books you cant ever forget. It will haunt me forever. This is such a beautiful book and the idea behind it is just so original. Id been told for almost two years that I absolutely had to read it and I was really curious about it because I wanted to know if it was as good as people say. I totally agree, everyone should read this book because it totally messes with your mind and your feelings in a unique way. There should be more books like that! From the very beginning the writing caught my attention. It is extremely wellwritten and the author knows how to use words which are both powerful and poetic. The descriptions of the characters are pure magic. He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever. I could perfectly picture the Liars even though I had a bit more trouble with the other cousins and uncles and aunts because the book is short and they are not really in the spotlight. I had expected a million things from this novel but certainly not this. It has a mysterious aura and is completely captivating. From the very beginning you know something wrong and twisted is coming and, of course, you try to take as many guesses as you possibly can but I never would have imagined the truth. It was such a surprise for me and it broke my heart. A lot of people say it was hard for them to get into the book at first but I didnt face the same problem. I totally loved the writing style and I am sure I would love more books from this author. I was fascinated by the Sinclair family and all those luxurious places in which you can easily picture yourself thanks to the amazing descriptions. Cadence is a very interesting character. She is very sick at the beginning of the book and it made me feel both bad and curious when you compare those chapters to the flashbacks in which she looks so happy and full of energy. I kept wondering what happened to make her so damaged. I had the urge to turn the pages quickly because I desperately needed to know the truth but I also didnt want to finish this book because I knew I was about to find out a horrible truth. When I got to the fifth part of the novel, I understood how much I had been lied to and I just couldnt get over it. I loved everything about this book and I would recommend reading it without knowing too much, first because it is really short and fastpaced I read it in just three sittings, and second because there is so much suspense you dont want any spoilers. You need to find out the truth when you get there, just like Cadence does. Definitely a mustread for me.
 Have you read Annihilation and Authority and now youre ready for some answers? Jeff VanderMeer delivers the answers you want, and much more, in Acceptance, the final book in the Southern Reach Trilogy. This is a hard one to review, because its kind of the big reveal book, although its really not VanderMeers style to smack you in the face with shocking revelations. Shocking things do happen, to be sure, but events unfold like one of the deadly flowers you might find in Area X, and youll find, while reading, that all the clues were there, in this, and the first two books, and the author wisely trusts his readers to follow the cleverly scattered breadcrumbs. In Acceptance, we join up with Control and Ghost Bird as they head back into Area X, in search of a team member that Ghost Bird is intimately connected to. The lighthouse keeper, Saul Evans, is a huge part of the story, and his is a poignant and important one, as one of the first to experience the otherworldly encroachment of Area X. The psychologistDirector gets her own story, and it humanizes a figure that seemed a little to the left of human in Annihilation. If youll remember, she was manipulating her team, and eventually, as everything fell apart around her, she found herself succumbing to Area X. Perhaps, among the most important things for me, was the mystery of what happened to the biologist, and she has her say as well. Keep in mind, the border of Area X has shifted drastically, and it seems to be continuing its advance, but what does that mean for mankind? This trilogy is very much about transformation, of the literal and figurative kind, and the author does a phenomenal job in filling out each characters background, and their motivations. The alternating narrative carries an undeniable sense of creeping dread, a prelude to a quiet apocalypse, but no less terrifying for its subtlety. We learn about who these people were, before Area X took over their existence, and its their very human need for answers, at almost any cost, that leads them to their ultimate destination, and sometimes, to their utter doom, although some are caught up in Area X through no fault of their own. The wild and terrifying beauty that is Area X, and VanderMeers ability to create such a rich, immersive, fully realized place, is one of the things that makes these books what they are, and indeed, Area X is a living, breathing character all its own. Area X is the soft rustle of the leaves, a night sky full of alien stars, and the ripples on an ocean as a leviathan breaches the surface, so similar, yet so different from our own natural world. Disturbing and beautiful in equal measure, Acceptance, like Annihilation and Authority, will transport you, and it brings the trilogy full circle. Books like this dont come around very often, and this is a series not to be missed.
Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for both her kindness, and her stunning yet imperfect beauty which is said to be more breathtaking than that of her stepmothers, Queen Levana. Levana fears her stepdaughter will take control of her throne, her people, and her power and she is willing to do whatever it takes to preserve her reign over the hearts and minds of her people. Winter despises her stepmother and has been attempting to undermine her in her own way, and now she has some new allies  Cinder, Scarlet, and Cress. Together, perhaps they will be able to end Levanas despotic rule once and for all. Winter is a fantastic conclusion to the brilliant Lunar Chronicles. I have loved following this series every step of the way. I was worried about the finale, but I shouldnt have been because this is a good solid ending to one of my favorite series. I read the novel over the course of just over three weeks  not just because of the sheer size of the novel, but because I wanted to savor every last moment I could with these characters. In regards to the characters, Winter is a compelling addition to the main cast. Shes very sweet with a hearty dose of crazy, and thankfully she is able to hold her own alongside our already established core. Without giving too much away overall, Cinder and Kai steal the ending, Scarlet and Wolf endure the most, Cress and Thorne are still my favorites everything that comes out of his mouth is golden, and Iko is still awesome. The characters all have a long road ahead of them at the beginning of this novel, and the character development is above average. Everyone has their own time to shine. As usual, Marissa Meyer incorporates the fairy tale elements to Winters story. Obviously, we have Levana as the evil stepmother evil queen, Jacin as the huntsman, the apple, the glass coffin, and the seven dwarfs All of the key elements that you would expect to be associated with a Snow White retelling have been given a unique scifi makeover. We also get a better look at Luna itself and Levanas court, which reminded me of the Capitol from The Hunger Games. In the end, my only real issue is the length of the novel. Although, I loved every second of it, it could have been trimmed back a bit in places without hurting the main storylines. Overall, Winter is everything that I could have asked for to wrap up one of my favorite series and there is so much to love about it. I still need to get my hands on Stars Above and the upcoming graphic novels, but I will truly miss these characters when its all said and done. Im beyond excited for Marissa Meyers take on Wonderland in Heartless and also superheroes and supervillains in an as yet unnamed new series.
55  Scout Finch and her brother, Jem, live in a small town in 1930s Alabama with their father, Atticus, and housekeeper, Calpurnia. A neighbor, Dill, joins them in the summers and the trio spend their time outdoors, thinking up ways to lure the mysterious Boo Radley outside. One day, Scout and Jem learn that Atticus, a lawyer, will be representing Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping and assaulting a white woman. Scout and Jem are harassed at school because of this, and their aunt eventually comes to live with them to help keep tomboy Scout out of trouble. Continued under spoilers... The trial comes and goes in an emotional scene that had me cheering for Atticus and furious at everyone else in the courtroom and Tom, even though Atticus proves his innocence, is convicted of the crime. Later on, Tom tries to escape jail but is shot and killed. Scout, Jem, and Dill are affected in various ways by the trial and learn important lessons. Slowly, life in Maycomb is returning to normal. However, Bob Ewell, the accusers father and the one who actually assaulted her, is still furious with Atticus for publicly shaming him. He attacks Scout and Jem on their way home from a Halloween play. Boo Radley rescues the children, though Jem gets a broken arm, and kills Bob Ewell. Scout walks Boo back home after the Sheriff says, Theres black boy dead for no reason, and the man responsible for its dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Atticus reads a book to Scout until she falls asleep and spends the night watching over Jem. I appreciated the simplicity of the language. It felt like I was reading a story in the hot, humid South. The story flowed perfectly with Lees writing style; it was straightforward and charming yet never boring. I think the simplicity is what made the message so powerful. Im just going to assume that people who dont like this book if you can believe that were probably forced to read it. I know some also think the characters were a little onedimensional. I understand that argument, but dont completely buy it. Sure, Atticus was a perfect, candonowrong father figure, but I dont think it made him unbelievable. He had the weight of the world  or at least Alabama  on his shoulders. He had to hold himself at a high standard, especially for his children. Scout was my favorite, with her tomboy tendencies and polite backtalking. I loved that I could read from the perspective of a child and not want to skim over her thoughts. Once, she referred to waiting as two eternities later, or something similar, and I laughed out loud. One character I wanted to see more of was Tom. His main appearance was in the courtroom and Atticus speech on Toms behalf there broke my heart, so naturally I wasnt satisfied. But because it was Scouts story and she was so young, Tom was only there to be an innocent  a mockingbird. The following are a couple of quotes I most appreciated: People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for. Shoot all the Bluejays you want, if you can hit em. But remember its a sin to kill a Mockingbird.
I heard about this book since Stephanie Meyer recommended it back when The Twilight Saga was just starting out and I immediately checked out the synopsis to see if it was something Id be interested in. After finding out it was some kind of adventure book I wasnt really into it. Im more of a romantic novel kind of person, where the focus in on the two main characters falling in love, but after years of hearing nothing but good things about it, I decided to give into the masses and read it. I have to say, I dont regret it at all. The action and suspense of the games really kept me going through this book and I finished it in no time. The beginning was kind of boring, which is usually the case in most books, but I love the intricate and details of the world that Suzanne Collins created and how the games are played out. Once it all got started, it was really hard to put the book down. The main character, Katniss, is definitely one you will adore, her love for her family and for people in general, makes you really care for the girl and hope for her survival through this inhumane and deadly game. I really liked how, through the games, Katniss discovers so much about herself, like her survival skills and what is it that makes her so special. You also get to see the animalistic nature, dangerousness, and kindness of the other participants of The Hunger Games that leaves you rooting for some and hating others. The way The Capitol uses these children in this crazy and dangerous game of theirs is ridiculous! The whole book is definitely quite suspenseful and sometimes it even had me at the edge of my seat, dying to know what would happen next. There is even a dramatic, and very unique twist towards the end of the game that left me in shock I really enjoyed that part, though the whole thing was just crazy, you wouldnt even consider that to come into play. You also see her battling with herself as she has to actually kill people in this game, even those she doesnt want to, like her friend Peeta, who came from the same district as her. It leaves you thinking about all that you would have to do to survive and what you would have to sacrifice in order to stay alive.
I absolutely fell in love with this story and all of its characters in the first novel, The Burning Sky, and I knew that I would be with this trilogy until the very end. The Immortal Heights did not disappoint. It was one of the best trilogy endings Ive read this year. While the pacing was a bit slow to start with, the character growth, continued worldbuilding, and lovely narrative more than made up for it. I couldnt recommend this trilogy highly enough. Iolanthe and Titus were two of my absolute favorite YA leading characters. They were a fantastic couple, and the power dynamics constantly switched between them, painting them as equals. Iolanthe is a brilliant leading lady, and shes strong, smart, and powerful. Even with all of the nonstop trouble she faced, she managed to still evolve throughout the novel, and the big surprise to do with her shocked me to my core. I did not see that coming. Titus also grew throughout the novel, and I always loved how he battled between being a normal hero and a princely hero. I also enjoyed getting to know more about Khaskhari. He was a bit of a mystery up until about the middle of the last installment, so learning about him was a real treat. The writing, for the most part, was brilliant, though the use of his person or her person instead of the word body or anything else STILL annoyed me. Nonetheless, the author stayed true to form, and I admire that. The descriptions were beautiful and completely immersing. The balancing between the real world and the fantasy world was interesting throughout the entire series, how they interacted, and how they stayed separate at the same time. Thomas did an excellent job with that in this novel, too. The pacing at the first part dragged for me a bit, but it was still full of suspense, which kept me reading. About halfway through, the pages flew by, and after an emotional ending, I was left wondering what just happened to the last half of the book. I was in disbelief that one of my favorite trilogies was truly over. Overall, I really adored this book and trilogy. If you like fantasy at all, you need to read this series. Fans of Harry Potter will eat this up. If you havent read any of these yet, pick up The Burning Sky. You wont be sorry.
This was such a gem to read. I treasured every word. The writing on the page seemed magical. This book totally enveloped me. I loved the premise of the book and the characters but the best part was the authors writing. Such beautifully, descriptive prose that seemed to capture the essence of magic and its effect on you. . The most interesting thing about this book was that the magic was real and it was being disguised as illusions. I was expecting the opposite which is typical of most books like this. This was done for the sake of the audience who supposedly wouldnt be able to handle it if they knew the magic was real. I never thought of it that way, but I agree that it would be hard to accept. Two magicians have had an ongoing rivalry for centuries involving pitting their proteges up against each other til only one of them is left standing. One of them is the daughter of the magician, Celia and the other is an orphan Marco. Each is capable of magic in their own way and when the times comes, Marco becomes his masters right hand man of the circus he creates and Celia becomes one of its illusionists while ironically ensuring the reality of the circus. They do have a subdued love for each other that is built up more and more as the book progresses. They are both unsure what to do about it since they are rivals in this game they were thrown into. But you sympathize for them and feel their love growing stronger in the mean time. It is easy to get lost in their imaginative world they create when they are together because of such beautiful writing by the author. There are plenty of colorful supporting characters that play a large role in the future of the circus. There are the twins, Poppet and Widget, Tsukiko the contortionist, and Bailey who is a normal person who became connected to the circus while fulfilling a dare. They are all very likeable characters and distinctly unique, each with a fascinating story. The author clearly explained the ending and reasons for it which I am not used to. I am used to the ending of these kinds of books leaving you wondering what really happened and what was real or not. I am glad I know for sure what happened with all of the characters and the circus and how and why it happened. It did not take away from the magic of the book. It made it more real and acceptable compared to being just an illusion in our own minds. Which makes me wonder if illusions are better than real magic since they are more mysterious. Very ironic indeed.
Five Things About Six of Crows The characters are spectacular. I could talk for hours about each of the characters in SIX OF CROWS and although Im pretty sure I wouldnt survive five minutes in their world, I wish I could be there to hang out with them every dayI adore this perfectly imperfect band of thieves. These characters make me want to reevaluate what unique and original characters are. When everyone knows youre a monster, you neednt waste time doing every monstrous thing. I fell in love not even halfway through. I believe I made it to page 120 before I started texting my bookish friends and gushing telling them how awesome it was, how the hype was welldeserved, and threatening gently encouraging them to read it as soon as possible. I was tempted to go on Goodreads and immediately give it five stars, even though I had a long ways to go. The writing is gorgeous. I did enjoy Bardugos original Grisha trilogy, but SIX OF CROWS is on a whole different level. Everything is so easy to visualize, and the writing was descriptive and illustrative without being tedious. THE QUOTES YOU GUYS. I want to include almost every line in this book here. In addition to this, there are also moments of humor that legitimately made me laugh out loud. The worldbuilding is incredibly inventive. Greed may do your bidding, but death serves no man. While the world of SHADOW AND BONE was not lacking by any means, SIX OF CROWS takes it even farther and develops it further. I do have to admit it was a little overwhelming in the very beginning and I had that what is this, what is that whiplash but as you continue to immerse yourself in the world it all starts to come together. The developing romances are GOLD. All of the characters have a fascinating dynamic with one another, but I am extremely eager and excited when it comes to some possible romances here. Theres this one quote that is absolutely awesome but a little spoilery so I didnt include it but THESE SHIPS. heavy breathing  I have enjoyed many books, but there are probably less than twenty that, if I were to come into a substantial amount of money, I would purchase copies of and give out to anyone everywhere I could. SIX OF CROWS is one of those books. Highly recommended. You can find more of my reviews on Readers in Wonderland!
Every once and a while, a book garners such commercial and critical acclaim that it becomes a kind of phenomena. Since its release, I have heard nothing but praise for The Help. As is often the case, I put the book on my list of books to read, and there it has sat. With the movie adaptation of the novel receiving award recognition, I finally got my hands on a copy of the book and decided to see what all the talk was about. The story opens with a narrative by Aiblileen, a black maid maid working for a young, white family in Jackson, Mississippi, 1962. She carries a sense of wisdom, as she raises the young daughter of the family, her seventeenth white baby. Despite the loss of her son, he couldnt get the proper care in the colored hospital, Aibileen finds a kind of solace through her job, her faith, and her best friend Minny. Minny is also a maid. While she is praised for her cooking skills, her sassy mouth has gotten her in trouble with previous employers, and finds her with no job and a husband who beats her regularly. Eugenia Phealan, Skeeter, is a fresh out of college, 22 year old white woman, who has returned home, to her mothers dismay, without a husband. We learn that Skeeter has always had trouble fitting in with what society, and her mother, expect of her. Upon her return home, she is shocked to learn that the maid who raised her, Constantine, has left the family home, and no one seems to want to tell Skeeter what happened to her. Saddened by the loss of her childhood companion and eager to get a job at a big publishing company, Skeeter decides to write something important. After a chance encounter with Aibileen, Skeeter enlists her and her friends to tell their stories of being, The Help to white families. I found this to be an unputdownable read, that perfectly mixed lighthearted fiction with the horrors of racism in the south during the 1960s. It is fascinating to read about three strong women who are forced to deal with problems that, unfortunately, many can still relate to today. By relaying the story of each main character through their perspective, Stockett provides beautifully imagined insight into the minds of these progressive women. In knowing the history of this time period and the violence it entailed, there was and underlying sense of suspense throughout the entire story. A kind of To Kill A Mocking Bird for modern audiences, The Help is a book that demands to be read by all.
Quick reaction: SO GOOD. SO, SO GOOD. Im in love. Long reaction: Original is here:  Due to the copyandpaste, formatting has been lost. edited to add: AND I FORGOT TO MENTION! This is a starred review It is the fourth day of November and so, today, I have finally found a book that in my humble opinion surpasses The Hunger Games. Heres the thing: The Hunger Games was my ultimate favorite book. And then a little something called The Scorpio Races came along and I drowned in it. I drowned in it and I loved it. Loved it more than my favorite book. Thats right. The Scorpio Races is now my favorite book of all time. I cant tell you exactly what it is that made me fall in love with this story, because its not just one thing, but so many things that together they started to blend and blend until the only coherent thought I had was that I am in love. This book is unlike anything youll ever readit was certainly the most original thing I have ever read. There is not just character development, but plot, twists, surprises, heartbreaks, hope. They are each a mountain and you journey with the characters to the top, where the skies swarm below you and the world lies beneath your feet and all you feel is this feeling of greatness that nothing else can fulfill. In fact, it seems to me that the more I think about this book, the more this feeling of... this feeling Ive only felt with my most favorite books of all time The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, etc. bubbles up. And the thing is that I finished this book four days ago, on November 1st also happens to be a very significant day in the book!, I sat on it for four days and I still love it beyond words. In fact, to ask me why I love this story is like asking wings why they fly. Because they do. Because I do. Because there is just no other way around it. Im trying to keep this review short and succinct, so you can go ahead and get this book already. But I feel like its important that you know I have not previously read any of Maggies books. Ive heard of the Shiver trilogy and theyve been on my TBR list for a long time, but Im so overwhelmed with paranormal vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc. nowadays that I just never really felt compelled to pick it up. I will now. Right now. I need more Maggie. If there is one book you can get, get this one. Theres just nothing else I can say except this: the sunset is an explosion of colors, and this book is an explosion of beauty. Pure magical. Phenomenal. And I never say this, truly, I never do, because I didnt believe in it. But I will say it now, because it is finally true: Flawless.
My first YA book and I fell in love with it so quickly. In general I love happy endings, I crave them and consider them necessary to make me completely happy about a book. Well, read TFIOS and you will change your mind. A book can deliver the same message even when you find another type of ending. The story line is very simple: Hazel, a 16 year old girl with cancer, is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets Augustus Waters, a former basketball player who has fallen victim to cancer as well. Because of this, he is left without his leg, wearing only a prosthetic. Hazel and Augustus clicked immediately, mostly due to their passion for books. They agree to read each others favorite books and talk about them after that. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten about a cancerstricken girl named Anna. Hazel connects with the character from her book and relates to the story. Soon they start on a journey to Amsterdam, in quest for the writer of Hazels favorite book. Here they confess their love to one another and a beautiful but short love story begins. I will let you discover the characters, they are so strong and can teach you so much about life, even at their age. Hazel and Gus are mature, determined and had a rough life, that their words really sink in and are here to stay. What I loved so much about this book was its ability of putting simple words together and delivering such a strong message. The things that you learn from this books are endless in depth and many tears will be shed. After reading it, I just stared at the ceiling for 10 minuted and reflect on a common but so true fact, that life is so precious and no moment has to be taken for granted no matter what. You learn so much from 2 kids that are suffering from a terrible disease but fight in order to survive and have a normal life. Please read this book with your heart and try to understand and appreciate what you have. In the beginning,I was kind of mad at the writer for making such a sad book, but after that I realized that he had to get his message through, to prove a point, and maybe a happy outcome was not the right way of making it happen. My vision of happy endings changes once reading this book, because I understood their necessity and I wanted to learn from them as much as I could. Although not all of us realize it, being healthy is such a blessing and ables you to enjoy all that life offers. Hazel and Gus were an example of taking chances, even when all the odds were against them,but managed to have their little infinity for a short period of time. Discovering the right person, even if its too late, can give you the same satisfaction as in having her all your life. Live that moment and love intensely every day, as if there is no tomorrow. 5 stars for this truly inspiring book! For more reviews please check 
I continued my read along with TLCReadAlong by reading Cress in about 4 days. It was so good! I absolutely love this series. I cant wait to read Fairest hopefully this weekend, in anticipation for Winters release on Tuesday! I gave Cress 5 out of 5 stars. In this book, its pretty much the same set of main characters, with the addition of Cress. And I thought she was absolutely adorable. Its been a couple months since I read the first book, so my memory was a bit hazy when they introduced her. Thankfully the book explained pretty early on who she was. The book was pretty fastpaced, despite being fairly long. A 550 page book would probably usually take me over a week to read, but I couldnt put it down. I think the series does get better with each book. Cress is probably my favorite so far, and Im hoping Winter is just as good, if not better. I was absolutely riveted as I read. I love all the pairings in the book. I still want all the main male characters to be my book boyfriends. Theyre all amazing in their own ways. And I want to be friends with all the female characters. Really, I just want to live in this amazing world that Marissa Meyer has built for her fans. The whole series is based on fairy tale retellings. In this book were supposed to see some of the Rapunzel fairy tale. We do see elements: the long hair, and Cress being locked away from everyone. It wasnt as strong on the retelling aspect as some of the previous books as far as I can tell, or maybe I just dont know the true Rapunzel fairy tale well enough. I did mark down two lines from the book: He was exactly the kind of hero Cress had been dreaming about her entire life. and You were so certain that I was this other person, and I kind of liked that you saw me differently than anyone else. Part of me kept thinking that maybe youve been right all along, and its everyone else whos been wrong about me. That even Ive been wrong about me. But for the most part I was so absorbed that I didnt even think about my favorite lines. I especially love the last couple chapters of Cress, and I really cant wait for Winter to come out. I want to know what happens next! Final note: An amazing third book to the series! I am so excited for Winter to come out next week! Check out the series if you havent already. Im positive you wont regret it!
November 9 is equally based around two main characters, Fallon and Ben. Fallon meets Ben, who is an aspiring writer, the day she is planning to move from LA to New York. Their instant attraction to each other leads them to spend Fallons last day in LA together and her seemingly eventful life becomes the creative inspiration for a novel that Ben has been searching for. Over the course of several years and among many different relationships and tribulations that occur in their own separate lives, they continue to meet once a year on the day they met, November 9th, until one day Fallon becomes unsure if Ben has been telling her the truth of creating a perfect reality for the same of the ultimate plot twist. As with every Colleen Hoover novel I read, this book was not what I expected, it was much more. I dont like putting her books into just the genre of New Adult and Romance because I honestly feel that they are much more then that. I was a bit unsure about this book because of the way it is written. The beginning chapters introduce us to Fallon and Ben, giving us a bit of insight into their backgrounds and surrounding the day they meet. The book then jumps to the Second Number 9 and then the Third November 9 and so on and so forth. However, it worked great. I didnt feel as if I lost any of the character development or got to know the characters less with this type of writing. Inside each of these sections, the chapters alternate between Fallons point of view and Bens. November 9 is a fantastic book, but one I am having a hard time reviewing without giving away any spoilers. Because fans of Colleen Hoover know that there is always at least one plot twist. The ones in this book I did not see coming at all. Every time I read another of her books I think, This one is definitely my favorite. But thats a lie; at the moment its tied between November 9, Ugly Love and Maybe Someday. If you havent read any of her work, I encourage to do so immediately. This book was no different from her others; it makes me laugh, it made me cry and at the end of the book, I wished that it would continue. Happy reading!
I have had the privilege to once again Beta for the amazing RL Griffin. Let me just say that Seamless is by far my absolute favorite book from the By a Thread series. I have enjoyed this series so immensely and Im really going to miss these characters, but their story will stay with me forever. Seamless is the conclusion of Stella Murphys story. Its the end of a journey filled with love, loss ,heartbreak, fear, rejection ,friendships and of course, what would seamless be without a bit of tension. Understatement of the century. I was on edge through the entire book. It sucks you in and takes you on a journey that will not disappoint. Perfection is elusive and may truly be an illusion,but its still something everyone strives for. Stella just needs normal. A normal happy life filled with everyday mundane things, but as fate would have it, thats not in the cards for her as Jamie is still tormenting her and he is hell bent on getting her back. He is even more desperate now and his actions speak volumes as to the lengths hed go to get Stella back. What Jamie fails to realize is that Stella is sick of the threat and fear that has become her every day life. Shes ready to play Jamie at his own game. With George and the rest of her friends behind her its time to put and end to Jamie, but Stella fears for the people she loves and would rather push them away and run than let any harm come to them.  I want to be your peace, like you are for me. I want all these things and one day I will get them. I will look at you and know that we are forever and there are no devils for you to fear, because Im there. Imagine a man that is so in love with you that he will do whatever it takes to make you feel beautiful and loved even when you are covered in scars. A man that can look past the ugly and hurt and see the broken, vulnerable soul that is capable of loving and being loved. George is that man. The love, support and ultimate heart break he endures loving Stella is truly amazing. The lengths George goes through to protect Stella and their love was so touching but even he has a breaking point. Why keep putting yourself back together if youre just going to keep breaking apart? When I finished this book I was in awe, it was just that good. I think I may have actually had a bookgasim. RL Griffin is an amazing writer, I love that she manages to touch her readers with the emotion that comes through the pages. Her characters feel real and I can connect and relate to each and every single one of them in one way or another. From vox, to wine and music to my ears...shoes. When I wasnt filled with angst, I was laughing out loud and even ugly cried too. This is one book that I wish I could read again for the first time.

We believe what we want to believe. We believe what we need to believe. Maybe theres no difference between wanting and needing. I dont know. Three years ago, two teenage girls, Emma and Cass Tanner, disappeared from their home. Now, Cass has come back, but where is her sister? You may find this description a bit vague, but believe me when I say that this is a book best delved into blindly to make the most of the mystery lying at its core. So if you havent read it yet, please tread with caution  whilst I will try and stay away from spoilers, even little innocent remarks could spoil a major aspect of the plot in this convoluted tale of lies, betrayal and family dysfunction! Just as I was complaining that there havent been enough books out there lately that mess with my mind, I came across Emma in the Night and bang! I eat my words, because this is a book that has all the elements of a twisted psychological thriller. Without giving away too many clues, it is instantly obvious that Cass, the returned teenager, is a troubled soul. Can she be trusted? Have her experiences in the last three years scarred her so much that she has gone crazy, like her mother is claiming a mother, who Cass calls Mrs Martin  go figure? And what is really going on in the Martin household? These are the questions forensic psychologist Abby Winter is asking herself as she is frantically trying to untangle Cass story in a race against time to find her older sister Emma. Personality disorder and dysfunctional families feature prominently in this dark and disturbed tale, which leads the reader down a path so windy and tangled that one can never quite see the way out of the thorny thicket that is the story of Emma and Cass disappearance. Told in part in Cass own voice, and partly from the viewpoint of Dr Winter, I was never quite sure who I could believe or trust  which made the story quite intriguing for me! I admit that at times I struggled with the web of family dynamics, which are disturbing to say the least, and which carried a large part of the story. Arent I a good mother? The best mother you could ever want? With some confronting images, this is not for the faint of heart! And although the book is brimming with unlikeable characters, the authors extensive knowledge of narcissistic personality disorder presents them as threedimensional personalities, making the tale all the more chilling in its premise. Emma in the Night is a twisty and disturbing tale focusing on family dysfunction, personality disorder and the effects of childhood trauma. With many of the elements that make for a riveting psychological thriller, Walker delivers a story that will stay with you long after the final page has been turned. Highly recommended to lovers of the genre who like a story where nothing is quite as it seems. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. blog facebook instagram
In April 1999, when the attack on Columbine High School took place, I was a Senior in high school. I was in another state, 1,000 miles away, but the shooting instantly changed the way even our school operated. I remember after the attack, we starting having school shooting drills instead of fire drills. A special alarm sound was chosen that would alert us when someone with a gun was spotted on school grounds. When the alarm sounded, the teacher would lock the door to the classroom, cover the window on the door, and everyone would have to practice hiding under their desks and remaining silent. They just wanted to be prepared. Like most people, I followed the case through the news, and knew the basic facts about the case. When I read a review of Dave Cullens book, though, I realized there was a lot more to know, and I was curious. This book is intense, detailed, and chilling, drawing you into the minds of Eric and Dylan, the 2 shooters. Finally, we get a glimpse into why they decided to shoot up their school, and shockingly, its not what the media and the police told us 10 years ago. After the actual loss of life, I was most saddened and angered to hear about all the lies and coverups by the County Sheriffs department in the hours and years following the shootings. They continually lied to the media, the public, and even the families of the victims. Also, that the slow response of the police and the SWAT team eventually caused the death of one of the victims, teacher Dave Sanders, as he bled out over 3 hours in a classroom is heartbreaking to hear. Also sad to read about was that Cassie Bernalls famous She said Yes moment didnt actually happen to her. The boy who thought he heard Eric ask her the question Do you believe in God? was mistaken  he didnt ask Cassie that at all. That question, and the subsequent answer, came from a different spot in the room entirely. After shooting and injuring a girl, and then hearing her pray to God, Dylan turned around and asked her if she believed in God. SHE said yes, and Dylan spared her life. But despite the mistake, the general consensus in the public today is that it was indeed Cassie who said those words, because that is what the media spread, and the church latched on to it. It was particularly frightening to read that Eric  Dylan had planned on killing many more people that day  the only reason so many survived was because the bombs they planted failed to explode. Also, many more would have died if they had shot everyone they saw, instead of random people here and there. It seems bad to be thankful for these things, but I cant help feel this way. In the end, this book is not only about the shooting, but about the minds of the boys as they prepared for it, and the aftermath in the community, as friends, family, and victims tried to cope with the life they had left.
I read and loved Dawns debut The Dead House and I was so excited to read her next book. And wow, does this author know how to write a great YA psychological thriller. It has taken me two days to review this book something that rarely happens anymore but I seriously needed that time to wrap my head around what happened in this book and how I felt about it. There is so much about this book that I want to talk about but I dont want to spoil you on it. Suffice it to say that there is a really interesting plot here. Its not quite a mystery, not quite a psychological thriller, and not quite horror either. It combines all three though to make a story that is so compelling. There are little clues along the way and points throughout the book that come together in a big way when you reach the eventual conclusion. And what a conclusion it was. It wasnt a total surprise but it did have me reeling. It was fantastic in that way. A lot of the enjoyment of the plot and this book came from the tone and atmosphere. This is definitely a book full of confusion and suspense. I am the type of reader who likes being confused, I like not knowing what is happening so this book gave me that. There are a lot of unexpected twists too. Moments where youre not super scared but youre worried and looking around your shoulder. It made for an interesting and atmospheric read. But most of the confusion I think came from the characters. This is a book with an unreliable narrator which I typically enjoy. And I did enjoy that aspect of Silla. She has definitely been through a lot and you want to see her and her sister Nori, who was so sweet, win in the end. However at the same time you see Silla slowly lose her grip on things. It was incredibly interesting but there is just something hard about connecting with a character like that. But mostly I found it hard to connect with the romance of the book. Despite liking Gowan, the male lead, the romance just felt strange to me and I think maybe that was because of my feelings of Silla. But in general I loved the unreliable narrator and the characters were complex. And the Trees Crept in is a fast and engaging story full of mystery and suspense. If you like Dawns debut then check this out or if you are looking for a unique read that combines mystery, horror, and psychological thriller in a subtle kind of way than check this out. Its be a good introduction to these kinds of books.
I really wasnt sure if I was going to like this book. There are many 5 star reviews but the words chicklit romcom and cheesy got to me. It was also a GR Best Romance book finalist. I was caught between expecting a lot and expecting nothing. What I found was a book that made a laugh out loud, made me crave Josh and Lucys interactions both crazy and sweet, and the amount of cheese was just perfect. The author really captured that wild obsessivelike behaviour you get when you first start dating someone and start to fall for them. It really put a big smile on my face and reminded me of those good ol days. I loved how much they were all over each other from day one, using games as a way to keep their infatuation with one another, whether it be mentally noting the shirt colour choices or staring into each others eyes the Staring Game for long periods of time. The chemistry between Lucy and Josh was wonderful. Some of the best I have read in a while. When Lucy stands up for him against his asshole of a father and we really got to see the shy side of Josh I just wanted to cheer. Josh was so endearing and the character development we get from the beginning of the novel was very well written. At first he is just an asshole who most likely has a crush on Lucy. No, the readers arent fooled. He is like the little boy on the playground who pulls on the girls pigtails to show her that he likes her. But then we really get to know him, as Lucy does, and we learn about this shy sweetheart who is sometimes hurt, sometimes lonely, and he becomes so real. Their highly witty hateful banter becomes even better sexual tension that was so much fun to read. I actually really enjoyed their banter in the beginning. I know some other readers saw it as childish, and it was, but it was also so hilarious. I loved all of Lucys jabs where she insinuates that Josh is the devil, and lives close to earths core. Yes, this is chicklit. Yes, it is predictable, it is sometimes cheesy and sometimes silly, but I loved it. I had a big smile on my face at the ending. Featherbrained Books Blog  Twitter 
 spoiler alert  Oh god my heart is in pieces right now I dont think I have words at all. First of all Cassandras writing in these books are so poetic and beautiful, they flow so perfectly. She makes you dive right in, into the lives of these characters and their story. Im so in love write now and heartbroken. I have no way to mend it, not until I read the next book. I know somewhat of what will happen next since I did read the entirety of The Shadow Hunter series and the novelas. But god this book, Im lost for words. The story so far has developed into this amazing this that I really need to know more about. Its not like one of those books where I can wait to know what will happen next. With this series I wish all the information were transferred into my brain in a blink of an eye. The characters in this book are so amazing. Tess, Will, Jem, Jessie, Charlotte, Henry even Sophie. I just love them and just picturing them heartbroken breaks my heart. Will, ugh Will, I dont want to spoil anything but I just want to curl into a ball and drown in a pool of my tears. I think he has taken my heart more than anyone in this series. Mostly because he is so relatable in so many ways and I hope hell be okay in the next book because of he isnt Ill die. I said not too long ago that I shipped Jem and Tess and I havent changed my mind I do, but I also want Will to be with Tess. Like they both deserve her and she deserves both of them and this is such a horrible horrible position to be in. My heart breaks for Tess too!!!!! I think this counts as spoilers so Ill add it as that. I also love Henry and I hate how some looked down on him since the beginning of the series I thought he was an amazing lovable character as well. When Charlotte and him confessed to each other that just made me happy as hell. Jess on the other hand I love too even if she did what she did I hope shes on the other book. I think Im done for the night though, I need to get my hands on the third book ASAPPPPPP! Barnes and Nobles here I come!!!
Less Reality More Books If I had a word to describe this book, it would have to be bittersweet. Were all familiar with the story of Alice in Wonderland; whether its through the books, the many TV and movie adaptions, or just for the classic quotes that are remembered so many years on. Were all mad here, Curiouser and curiouser. I use a lot of them myself. Now Ill be honest, besides the main story, and the quotes, and the characters, I dont know a lot about Alice in Wonderland; specifically, the Queen of Hearts. All I know is she is evil, and is very fond of the phrase, Off with their head! But this is Marissa Meyer, a queen in her own right of storytelling, and this is a prequel  the start of the life of the Queen of Hearts in Wonderland, long before Alice ever makes an appearance. I couldnt wait for this book! And while its not as amazing as her Lunar Chronicles series, I really did enjoy this book, and its makes me want to read Alice in Wonderland just to get a glimpse of the true Queen of Hearts from Lewis Carroll. Once I started reading this, and I got a feeling for our heroine, Catherines character, this picture immediately came to mind: Regina from the TV show Once Upon A Time was forced to be a Queen when all she wanted was to be with her love, a lowly stable boy. Very similarly, Catherine Pinkerton has no interest in being a Queen. She has aspirations to open up a bakery with her best friend and be known as the best baker in the kingdom. Love is the last thing on her mind. However, its on the front of her parents minds, who only want the best for their daughter, which in their minds means marrying the most powerful man in the kingdom. Everyone knows that Catherines dream of opening a bakery is very unlikely; no one is willing to give her a loan and her parents refuse to give her her dowry, but Catherine remains very optimistic that her bakery will become a reality, especially when the perfect store becomes vacant. What she doesnt expect is to meet Jest, the Court Joker, and become completely enamoured by him. He has a secret, but he too is taken with Catherine, and whenever the two are together you just melt; theyre so adorable. You want them to get their happily ever after, but real life just keeps getting in the way. I wont say any more plot wise, but it was so engaging! It was so sad to see Catherines hope and optimism fade over the course of the book. Things stop going her way, and secrets are revealed, and the likelihood that Catherine is going to open her bakery become less and less likely with every chapter. She starts to lose her smile, and we see her slowly transform into the Queen of Hearts everyone is so familiar with. For not all fairy tales have an happily ever after. Fans of the Lunar Chronicles are sure to love this, but be wary of your heart. The ending may just break it.
more reviews here I have heard so many people rant and rave about this book and I couldnt wait to read it, I am now the proud reader of Divergent. I fell in love with Divergent from the first page and nobody could stop me from devouring this book. Divergent was a little different from all the other Dystopian novels I have read lately. The characters were so real and I felt like I knew them personally. The detail of it all was amazing. There arent many books that I really get into book and almost feel the pain and sadness of the characters. Beatrice is the main character and my favorite character in the book, she is strong willed, brave and like no one else I have ever read about. She took so much pain and had to make so many different decisions that would change her life. Let me explain the plot of the book. There are 5 fractions, which are like cliques of certain people; you have Abnegation, Erudite, Amity, Dauntless and Candor. When you turn 16 you have to pick one of those 5 fractions. Before you pick a fraction you take a test, make a certain decision and the test tells you what fraction you would be best in. Beatrice wasnt any of those, the test was indecisive. She was a Divergent. Divergent is dangerous, if word got out that someone was Divergent they would be instantly killed. Beatrice kept her secret and picked her fraction. Beatrice picked the Dauntless, Dauntless were willing to risk their lives in a blink of an eye, they are trained to fight, to kill if the time comes. After you were to pick your fraction you would have to undergo a test, of strength, courage and lots of pain, physically and mentally. If you dont make it past the first couple of tests you are fractionless, which pretty much means your homeless. I was on edge the whole book, I thought that relationship was Beatrice and four was sweet and I loved it. It was intense and real. Divergent was a book that has many wishing for more and hoping theres a good outcome. The whole time I was reading I was thinking about what would happen if I was in the situation as Beatrice. I would not make thats for sure. I cant wait to read Insurgent, the second book in the series
This was a great story to lose myself in because it morphed from a friendship to a love story then there was a mystery to be solved and eventually a lot of suspense. So it pretty much crossed a few genres which was quite refreshing for me because it kept me guessing. Quinn is have time out from his marriage after his wife cheated on him. They had recently been through something very sad and painful and instead of turning inwards to her husband for support and comfort, she sought it outside of her marriage. Quinn loves his wife and takes his marriage vows very seriously, however he is beginning to realise that this separation could become permanent. Sometimes we need to stop wasting time trying to mend the things in life that are beyond repair. Instead, we need to allow them to fall completely apart so we can start rebuilding them with a stronger foundation. Lacey has just arrived in town to rent a Lake House, with her dog in tow. She was widowed after her husband was tragically killed and she needed to get away from everything in her town that were constant reminders of the life she had. She wasnt expecting to meet her new landlord Quinn and was equally surprised to discover he would be living above her in his own quarters. Thus begins a really sweet friendship between two people who have both had loss in their life and have both deeply loved someone else. It is really like fate that these two meet each other, as the months pass they individually can feel themselves healing and opening up. I really loved how Quinn brought Lacey out of her shell, often pushing her boundaries. She reconstructed the pieces of my heart, day by day, little by little, piece by piece, until it was finally whole once again There is more to come though, I just wanted these two to fall in love and live HEA but there are people determined to intervene. Some people from the past have been lurking in the background some who pose a threat to the life that Lacey has created for herself. There are a lot of secrets and revelations in this story that I did not see coming and I just couldnt read fast enough to keep up with everything. Needless to say I was very drawn into this book. There was one revelation near the end that I was a bit really? about but that was just because I felt the story was already wrapped up and it was like another added thing that I didnt think was necessary, however it did not take away from my enjoyment of this story.
This is not really a new story. Its a new mystery with, basically, the same characters as Sherlock Holmes stories. I mean  oh sure, its supposedly the great, great, great, great grandchildren of the original Sherlock Holmes and Watson, and one of them is a girl  but changing the gender of one of them and making them teenagers doesnt make them magically new. They are the exact same characters, plopped into a boarding school setting in Connecticut. Charlotte is a drug using, violin playing, overly intellectual and emotionally stumped loner. James is an aspiring writer that once wanted to be a doctor, who bumbles on occasion and idolizes Holmes, and massages out the sharp edges of his companion for polite society. Dont get me wrong  I generally like the HolmesWatson duo weve all come to know in so many iterations and this pair works in many of the same ways though throw in some YA love connection. James is a perfectly wonderful narrator  warm, funny and emotional and the story moves along at a reasonable clip. The mystery is fun though I did deduce the killer ahead of time pretty much as soon as I heard that Augustus Moriarty had a fiance . And the relationship between the two characters still felt authentic and had a natural build. I think I took most issue with Charlotte herself. I didnt have a problem with her being curt or smart. But her deductive reasoning sometimes verged on psychic abilities  which is fun at first, but annoying and too much over time. And the drug use wasnt so much of an issue for me  but it was a serious issue that no one really seemed to be bothered enough to do anything about it. Sending her to a different country doesnt seem like the best way to fix that situation. Also, what is with this girl not eating? I was moderately concerned that she had an eating disorder since this came up so often and yet, she was still somehow able to fill out a dress in a later scene? Even though she was so angular in earlier ones?. Meh. Also  seriously? There was a super specific list of ways that a Watson can deal with the Holmes in their life. Including things like Dont let them cook or Just remember that it isnt your fault  which begs the question  dont people change? How many people are EXACTLY like their parents and the parents before them?! Getting miffed at this list gave me a moment to remember that this is a fictional, YA world. So keep that in mind! End result  dont overthink it, and youll have a good time with this book though be aware that some mature themes.
Hazel is 16 and dying. She may be a medical miracle and her tumours may have shrunk, but her lungs are severely damaged, she needs a constant oxygen supply and knows that her days are numbered. When she meets the gorgeous Augustus Waters at the Cancer Kid Support Group something changes in her life though. She rises out of her lethargy and embraces life and love with fresh determination. A trip to Holland to meet an adored author brings the two teenagers closer together even if the meeting with their idol is a deep disappointment. The trip also reveals that Augustus cancer has returned, and suddenly the cards in their relationship are turned around. Who knew that such a heartbreaking story could be this uplifting? John Green doesnt spare his reader in this book. From the very first page this is an emotional rollercoaster ride and it never lets up. Hazel and Augustus are the sort of characters I wished I could meet and get to know. Greens writing brings them to life to the point where I felt the need to hug and comfort them. It is not all doom and gloom though. These are two clever and insightful teenagers whose banter is as likely to make you laugh as it is to bring a tear to your eye. This is a story about teenagers with cancer in which the disease takes a backseat to the spirit of the kids. Not because the book produces miracle cures for them but because they are bigger then their illness. The illness may limit their lives in many ways, but they determine how they live with it. On a side note, I loved the descriptions of Amsterdam. It is clear that John Green spent time there and really saw and understood the place and the people who live there. I love that Hazel and Augustus gave in to their feelings in my home town, it seemed an appropriate setting. This is a brutally honest and incredibly beautiful book. A book that gave me characters that will stay in my heart and mind for a long time. A book that I should have read at a slower pace because I know I there is a lot in there that deserved more thought and attention. This is a book I will have to read again to get everything it has to offer out of it.
Wow. I loved this so much more than Scarlet, and Im pretty sure that has everything to do with Cress and Thorne and Cinder and Kai. But mostly Cress and Thorne. Oh, and lets not forget everyones favorite, lovable comic relief, Iko. First of all, can we talk about what a great character Cress is? I may be alone in my thinking, but she seems like a breath of fresh air in a market saturated with Katniss and Tris wannabes. Shes resilient and resourceful, but she acts exactly like someone who has spent most of their life in forced seclusion would act. Shes been stuck in a tiny satellite for most of her life, only dealing with one person in that entire time frame, Sybil, one of Queen Levanas elite thaumaturges, who shows up about once a month with supplies and takes a blood sample from Cress. Cress was placed there in order to aid Levana in spying on earth especially Prince Kai and to shield Levanas ships illegally entering earth. As a result, Cress has a bit of inside knowledge that makes her valuable to someone like Cinder. Not to mention Cress would do just about anything to free herself from her tiny orbiting prison. Most of the knowledge she has of earth comes from newsfeed and net dramas that shes picked up in her satellite. She has virtually no people skills and is, understandably, emotionally immature as a result. Shes naive and innocent and a little at odds with reality having had to entertain herself with made up fantasies ever since she was a child. I loved how she had to actually create fantasies for herself in order to deal with and get through terrifying and precarious situations. It seemed appropriate for a girl whose world has just grown drastically bigger in a very short amount of time. I just dont think Ive ever read a character quite like her. I can understand how some people would find her annoying, but I think she acted appropriately in all her situations for someone of her background. I mean, the girl doesnt even really know how to describe mountains for pitys sake, thats how small and secluded her world has been. I also love her relationship with Thorne and the fact that, for most of the book, it was truly a case of the blind leading the blind. We saw a lot of the main players come together at the end of Scarlet, and while they get split up again on separate adventures for a lot of Cress, it was fun to see them finally beginning to work together towards a common goal. All in all, Cress was engrossing and fun and I really cant wait for Winter this November.
AUGUST 2016 BOOK CLUB: I love historical fiction, and I teach an entire class on WWII so I was excited to read this and get another point of view that made me emotionally connected to the events Im teaching about right now. I didnt know how much France was effected during the war. I knew that France was occupied, but it was crazy to read what it was like living in your home, selling all your things, I didnt think there was a single person who was lucky because they were left behind. I thought peoples experience in Carriveau and in Paris were as frightening and torturous as people who were deported in many ways especially the constant fear everyone lived with. I personally identified a lot with Isabelle and saw a lot of myself in her. I was so tragically sad about how Isabelle died, and how she pretty much sacrificed her life for the cause of a Free France and a Europe entirely free of Nazi Germany. Also, I saw a lot of Emily my older sister in Vianne, so it was fun for me to feel like I was reading about us. After reading this book, I just had an overwhelming gratitude to be living in a time where we dont have to live through war. That poor generation who lived through both wars, or even those who just remembered the first, their lives were forever changed, their loves and their families were separated and destroyed, and there were overwhelming psychological and emotional issues an entire generation experienced where there was nothing to do but try to forget or try to remember. Im not trying to get political, but I would do anything to prevent any type of war or conflict like that from happening again. Were so lucky to be so far removed from WWII that we, and our parents, dont know firsthand about any of it. However, the danger of that is that all of us dont know how terrible war really is. I felt like The Nightingale made alive to me the reality of a war that touched almost every person in the world, whether they had anything to do with it or not. This book and its strong, selfsacrificing characters made me see the strength and power of humanity what we can really endure but also the atrocities and cruelty that a few bad decisions can create when proliferated.
book 7 in my pride month challenge I finally read George after months of wanting to. I figured pride month was the perfect time to expand the types of books I read, even when it comes to LGBT rep. George is the first middle grade book I read since...I dont know honestly, it feels like its been forever. When rating this I chose to put aside my own feelings regarding the depth of this book because its obvious that I, a twentysomething year old, need to acknowledge that this book wasnt written for me and I chose to read it knowing perfectly well the protagonist was very young. Melissa is a 910 year old girl, but everyone thinks shes a boy. In fact, they all call her George and at the beginning of the book she hasnt told anyone that the name she likes for herself is Melissa. When she auditions as Charlotte for her class play, the teacher doesnt take her seriously and the role is given to her best friend, Kelly. Kelly is the first to whom Melissa tells shes a girl, and Kelly understands her and even thinks of a ploy to have Melissa perform in the play as Charlotte so finally everyone will see that she is a girl. Well, Im not going to spoil the rest of the book, but Im so happy with how everything turned out. I like the fact that the term transgender was clearly stated, because a kid reading this might need to have a word to base their research on if they feel like researching more about this. The friendship between Melissa and Kelly was so sweet and pure and it made me a bit nostalgic of that age because to be perfectly honest everyone should have a friend like Kelly and I didnt have it. At the end of the book the paperback, but I guess all editions have it is a FAQ by the author that I found pretty useful and should probably be read by anyone regardless of them reading the book or not. What I want to add is that I hope that this book is getting into the hands of the intended target audience. Its fine for us adults to read it and review it so that more people, more parents can know about it, but if this book isnt read by kids then everything will stay the same. So I beg you, if you are a parent, consider buying this for your kid. It doesnt matter if you think your kid might be trans or not, every kid should read all different kinds of stories. Why would you allow your kid to read about dragons and magic, very entertaining aspects of fantasy worlds which I love, but forbid them to read about very real issues that real people have to deal with, in our world? I guarantee you, your child wont become trans if they read this book, but it will help them a lot if they are, and if theyre not, it will prepare them for when they meet a trans kid or a trans adult.
An amazing take on vampires, demons and other beings. Has to be the most original story line I have read in a while about these supernatural creatures. H.D. Gordon has sculpted a new world, existing alongside ours that is darker and gritty in every way possible. Alexa Montgomery is a regular teenager with some not so regular stuff happening at home. Her mother has her constantly training for fighting and is always reminding her to protect her sister Nelly. Now this makes no sense to Alexa but she goes along with it, trusting her mother though the lack of love that she receives from this abusivelike mother makes me want to slap her mother! But it all pays off when one day, Alexas home is attacked and she and her sister a thrust into another world that Alexa knows nothing about. In this new world, in a town called Two Rivers, she learns she is a Sun warrior, the last of her kind actually. She learns to fight at her new school that is for gladiatorstyle warriors. Something is off about this world though; something sinister that threatens everyone who lives there. She begins to defy authority and is determined to discover how to change things to save herself and the ones she loves. I thought this book was amazing, so imaginative, the action never stops. I feel for Alexa for she is truly alone in the world. No one else can do what she does. She is vulnerable but has a head on her shoulders. I like her sister Nelly, a true kindred spirit and the only one Alexa trusts. Alexa is also courted by many guys who all want her but I like how she realizes that the one who truly loves her for certainJacksonis the one she trusts even a little bit. I loved how she never falls head over heels for anyone and doesnt go along with what everyone does but thinks for herself and wants to know more of what really is going on in Two Rivers and is determined to not fail. I do like Kayden, he is sexy and intriguing but could probably learn to be more upfront about his feelings for Alexa than he is. Excellent original storyline that kept me interested to the end. I was a bit disappointed that H.D. Montgomery ended it the way she did, left it with so many questions unanswered. I will be reading the next book in the series; I have to find out what happens next.
Second read: November 2017 Still as amazing as the first time around. First read: September 2015 I expected to love it, I wasnt disappointed. In the acknowledgments, Bardugo said she read a book about Amsterdam to write Ketterdam, its exactly what I felt, without knowing she meant to do it that way. Being back into the Grisha world was amazing, I really had missed it, Im thinking to give the previous trilogy a reread to be honest. I really enjoyed the parts of the world we got to discover, like Ketterdam or the Ice Court in Fjerdan territory. Each character was unique in its way, I enjoyed reading about every one of them. Truly, changing points of view all the time wasnt an issue in this book. However, Im warning you: you might be a little confused in the beginning, because Bardugo talks about everyone as if we already knew them, there are SO MANY NAMES, even of secondary characters. Nevertheless, I liked she did it from the beginning, because I had to be really careful, it gripped my attention this way. I think if I had to pick a favourite, it would be Nina, shes a Grisha who loves cake, so well. There is room for so much romance in the second book, but its not really the priority for the characters right away in the next book, because some of them will be in big trouble. I ship all the ships and Im glad there will be an homosexual relationship, because it doesnt happen that often in high fantasy. The plot was much about... Plotting. The first chapter was everything. It was from a different characters perspective, I was disconcerted but it was really necessary, because you see something really important happening, I wanted to read the rest of the book straight away after that, haha. I liked to see how many backup plans the characters had, the main ones like the villains. The heist was truly amazing, it took a big part of the story because every character had a part in it in the last part, the time was written below each chapter headers, so much things happened, really. The ending was full of twists and reveals, something went bad because of a second of inattention, thats crazy. Seriously, I want the next one in my hands right now. I only have a suggestion for Leigh Bardugo: can we have Wylans chapters in the next book please?
If I had to choose only one word to write on this review, it would be wow! Alas, I have a lot of words to spare, and I also have a lot to say about this book. So please endure my super long review because I absolutely loved this book! Gosh, I just loved the authors writing style in this one. The romance was not the center of the book  life was. This one was filled with so many things that could just happen to about anyone. Its realistic, painful and gritty, and its just so true to life. Its so inspirational, but it doesnt throw the lessons at your face. It shows, instead of tells. It was just all very natural, and it made me love it more. The main character, Kate, was so real that I felt like I knew her personally, like we were friends, which is why I cried so much in the end. It was not the ugly kind of crying, but it was just sad. At the same time, I accepted what happened because it still felt right, no matter how ugly the ending was. My gosh, this is how cancer books should be done! Sorry, TFiOS fans! I really adored her character because while she is very kind and helpful, she still has some flaws, and she just felt more human and more badass to me. I felt like she wouldve made an amazing mother, and her kid would be extremely lucky to have her. I just felt so connected to her in a deep, emotional level, and I just really love her.This makes me feel like crying I also loved all the relationships of the characters in this book. The friendship was really strong, and there was so much genuine support and love going on, which I rarely see in books. There were so many different personalities here, but somehow they bonded and formed a group. And towards the ending when Gus and Keller talked? That was one of the highlights of the book and one of my favorite book moments ever. Just thinking about it makes my heart swell because of the amount of respect they gave each other. All these characters are just so amazing and I wish, with all my heart, that they are real people instead. Gosh, this book took me to an emotional roller coaster ride. It made me laugh and it made me cry. It made me love and it made me hate. Its just so full of life, and this is the sort of book that everybody should be reading. So many people are already recommending this one but still, I feel like it doesnt have enough readers yet. For such an amazing book, it definitely deserves a million and more reads! This is definitely a book worth a thousand rereads.
I guess I should start by saying I did not read the Grisha trilogy first. I should also start by saying I will be reading the Grisha trilogy next. Ill also start by saying I was pretty confused at times in the beginning just trying to acclimate myself to this new world, the characters, the language, and al that. I should also start my review... I should just start my review. Actually, here are just some random thoughts:  It did take me a little time in the beginning to get my head around what was going on, but once everything clicked I was good to go. She does a great job of letting you use context clues to figure everything out rather than explaining everything to you. First I was kinda annoyed by that, but then I was cool with it.  The pacing is fantastic, and I loved how there was so much backstory that impacted how the characters related to each other. Sometimes it was subtle and you didnt really know why until later, and sometimes a chapter was dedicated to a characters past before jumping back to the present. The cast was developed very well and they offered plenty of surprises along the way.  This thing was actionpacked! I noticed in the end when everything was going crazy that the chapters became much shorter  just another way of keeping the pages turning and the action moving along. Lots of twists and turns song the way, too. I found myself wanting to stop reading, but then counting the number of pages in the next chapter, and just saying, Alright, alright, fine! Seven more pages! Five more! OK! One more chapter! Ahhhhh, alright this one is just a few pages! Im sure you know how that goes.  I really appreciated how there was some elements of romance here, but it wasnt a super cheesy YA kind of romance, and it was kept out of the way of the main story for the most part. Im here for the heist, man! Get dat money!  I hear the next book is even better. Im excited to read it, but it might be a little while. I loved how this one ended though. Guess I will learn about these Grisha before moving on. Also, other books. There are always other books waiting to be read.  Hey, how about that midnight black border around he pages that make the book seem extra dark and aesthetically cool. I was worried at first that the book was going to look awesome and be marketed in this sexy blackness all over but ultimately not deliver as far as content goes, but it wins a fourstar rating from me in both style and substance.  Kaz is the obvious choice for favorite character, right? I thought Nina was pretty awesome. And Wylan.  I think I will open a bar called The Crow Club where we will only serve craft beer and play indie rock music and good hip hop after midnight. Thursday will be Ladies Night.
This review was done by KissinBlueKaren Wow, this book! Where should I even begin? This book has brilliant story telling, a great cast of characters, time travel, fantastic world building, pirates, romance, costumes, myths, history, and it managed to keep my attention for three straight days of reading. This book may sound similar to Passenger , but it is not. This is a unique story and worth a read if you like any of the above mentioned subjects. Nix is a timetraveler. She is at her Fathers mercy as he travels through time just trying to get back to the love of his life, Nixs mother. The rules for time travel are simple; you need a map, you can only use it once, and you have to have a navigator that can read that map. They live aboard the pirate vessel Temptation. When a wrong turn leads them to a chance at the actual map her father is looking for, Nixies whole future comes into question. The map wont work with her on the boat, and the price for the map might end up costing the whole crew their very lives. This was such a fun read. Nixs life is so interesting. If the map shows it, then it exists. So they can travel anywhere, to anytime, real or imagined, as long as it is on paper. I loved the freedom of this rule or lack thereof and how the author used it to show us myths and legends as facts. Of course, not everywhere they go is make believe, but they have collected rare good from places they go to barter when they reach port. Also, there is a heist that needs to happen in this story for the captain to get the map that he needs. The reader isnt given much detail into the how of this theft, but it was so much fun to go along as they plan and scheme. Nix was terribly conflicted. She wants to help her father, the captain, but she is sick of not being enough for him. His quest for love tears her apart, but it is the constant in their lives. Nix has a good heart and she is torn between being sick of it, and wanting to do the right thing. I saw some mood swings in her that I could relate to. She is perfectly conflicted. The crew also consists of talented thief named Kash, who steals his way through time. Nix might have a thing for Kash, but she isnt sure. Then there is the boy Blake, whom she meets at port. He might be the kind of thing that keeps her in one place forever, but time is a big problem for these two. The romance wasnt the main focus of this book, but I still shipped Nix and Kash pretty hard. The world building in this book is fantastic. We cover a lot of ground in this story and the author does a great job of weaving myth and legend into actual places. I loved that the myths and creatures of this book added so much to the world and the story itself. I especially enjoyed reading the Authors Note at the end of this story, which lent so much info for the reader. Although this book is the start to a series, this book could be read as a standalone. This was a complete story, but I cant wait to see what is next in store for Nix and the crew.
Java Girls review posted at Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews Joan and Max are such similar characters, they recognize themselves in each other. Each is able to predict what the other will do because they know what they would do in the same situation. These are two broken people who have isolated themselves from those who care about them, and who would help them. Theyve pushed everyone away, sacrificed themselves, convincing themselves theyre not worth saving, and made some very bad life choices, to a point where neither knows any other way to be. Joans survival instinct is strong, her guilt, and singleminded determination is all that she knowsits what keeps her going. I found this equally admirable and frustrating. With every lie and bad decision, each time she would push Max, and others, away, I was hoping shed relent, set aside her fears, and trust someone to help her. It made for an extremely suspenseful storyI truly didnt know how it was all going to end. Somehow, Ms. OKeefe found a way to keep each character true to him or herself and still find a believable resolution. Burn Down the Night is told in alternating first person POV, which I enjoy. It is especially effective for these two characters, neither of whom reveals much. We need to be inside their heads to understand who they really are. Their backgrounds, past experiences, longing, and especially their fears are slowly revealed to paint a complete picture of how these two desperate people arrived at this point. I was thoroughly engrossed in both their stories. Their meeting, and the time they spend together is unique and rather unorthodox, but it forces them to get to know each other in a way they couldnt, and definitely wouldnt, otherwise. The connection between Joan and Max is intense and deeply personal, truly lifechanging. On one hand, this story seems to move slowly, but in fact, its perfectly paced for what Joan and Max need. I dont want to reveal too much, but the sex scenes are creative and different; a form of extended foreplay that is intense and hot as hell. With most authors, I find they have a distinctive style. A similar voice that carries over from book to book, no matter how dissimilar the plots or characters. Ms. OKeefe has written each book in this series in a different style, with a different voice, that perfectly fits the main character or characters of each book. This is so interesting and refreshing to me. I cant imagine its an easy task for a writer. Ms. OKeefe has quickly become a favorite of mine. Im in love with her wordstheyre thoughtful, beautiful, and perfectly tailored to her characters. Review copy provided for an honest review.
I was horribly bookish, to the point of coming right out and saying it, which I knew was not socially acceptable. I particularly loved the adjective bookish, which I found other people used about as often as ramrod or chum or teetotaler.  Dash  Lilys Book of Dares This is the kind of book that reinforces my attachment to YA as a genre. I would call my love of certain books from the genre a guilty pleasure except I dont feel the least bit guilty about it. I am still very much in touch with my inner teenager dont even get me started on my inner child that I dont find it hard to connect to that mindset when Im reading. And Rachel Cohn and David Levithan are a literary match made in heaven. This electronic age has turned desire for instant gratification into norm. Though I love and value the convenience and the advantages of email writing, instant messaging etc. I often think about the sweet anticipation of the past when people had to wait weeks, sometimes months for a letter to arrive. Dash and Lilys story dances somewhere on the middle ground between the two. Christmas is right around the corner and Dash, on a voluntary exile from all things Christmas, wanders into his favorite NY bookstore, The Strand. While searching for the first edition Salinger he comes across the red moleskin notebook which holds within its pages a dare left by a girl named Lily. What follows is a fun and adventurous exchange of dares which takes our characters all over preChristmas New York City. From delightful Santa encounters to nightclub visits where a band called Sorry Rabbi, Tricks are for Yids is performing, this book will leave you wanting to participate in a notebook dare all of your own. even if you are no longer a teenager A light and an extremely entertaining read, this book focuses more on the emotional and physical journey of each of the characters more than the romance aspect of the story. With Christmas actually right around the corner for us readers, it is the perfect time to pick up this book. If youre a fan of Rachel Cohn or David Levithan, if youre a fan of Christmas, if you love sarcasm, crazy barely believable adventures or eccentricweirdunusual characters, or if youre simply in the mood for a fun, quick and engaging read, then Im positive youll like this book. These two quotes will give you a better sense of the main characters, just so you know exactly what youre getting yourself into: I love snow for the same reason I love Christmas: It brings people together while time stands still. Cozy couples lazily meandered the streets and children trudged sleds and dogs chased snowballs. No one seemed to be in a rush to experience anything other than the glory of the day, with each other, whenever and however it happened.  Lily I had always felt that mittens were a few steps back on the evolutionary scale  why, I wondered, would we want to make ourselves into a less agile version of a lobster?  Dash
Losing hope is just toooo P.E.R.F.E.C.T!! I really enjoyed the intensity, pace and romantic scenes. This is not your average romance book so please grab it NOW! Furthermore, it is from a totally gorgeous Holders POV! I cant believe that Im going gooey even though hes a fictional character! ...I cant leave here without a little preview. I continue inching toward her until my mouth grazes her lips, and I kiss her. Really! I cant empahasise how much Im falling head over with heels with Holder because hes just so freaking attractive, possessive and super sweet! I want to kiss her more than I want air. I did not feel like I was reading a repeated story but in fact the raw emotions of guy finding true love and a purpose in life. Im extremely sorry for this long paragraph but I just had to put it in! Holder is MINE! Look at me. She hesitantly lifts her face and looks at me. Sky, Im not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, Ive never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking Im not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that youre feeling every single thing that Im feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses. He makes me so crazy throughout the book with all his monologues and the way he treasures Sky. I want to be Sky so badly!! Although shes not your perfect girlfriend, she is so damn perfect for Holder! I cant even explain to you how perfect this girl is. And when I say perfect, I mean imperfect, because theres just so much wrong with her. But everything wrong with her is everything that draws me in and makes her perfect. Im not sure if its because I read hopeless a few months back or that I merely read through the book but Im still surprised at the ending. It is another PERFECT WRAPUP! I really cannot ask for more!

Monsterland has a varying blend of great characters with a great mix of horror, terror, blood, gore and violence that will keep you turning the page for more. From the first page with werewolves roaming the swamps of the Everglades to the final pages with the monsters taking control of the park you will be gripped and enthralled. A perfect read for Halloween that once I started I couldnt put down. This book will appeal to teenagers and adults as long as you are not easily offended by gruesome killings. Are you brave enough to enter Monsterland and find out if the theme park succeeds or fails?
This deleted scene was a portion of Clockwork Prince. The only exception is that instead of Will in the released scene this one features Jem. If I had read this when it was originally offered it may have had a stronger impact. Since Ive read Clockwork Prince this short snippet had nothing to offer me. Looking for more Wicked Reads review: vkwickedreads.wordpress.com Merged review: A deleted scene between Will and Jem during Clockwork Prince. I enjoyed this look from Wills point of view. I enjoy being inside his mind. This scene shows the strong bond between Will and Jem. It showcases how each would do anything for the other to find true happiness. It is a gift to have a companion for life, as the two have each other. More Wicked Reads reviews posted on: vkwickedreads.wordpress.com Merged review: Alright, I am going to act like a total fangirl, which I never do... This book was awesome, splendid, amazing, engrossing, enthralling, wicked. Okay, enough fangirl action... I have read so many books lately in the YA genre that are total garbage that ppl rave about. This book however doesnt fall into any of those traps. The characters are genuine and maintain their personality traits throughout the book. They do not act like a 50 yr old one moment and a 2 yr old the next thank goodness I think I like the storyline of the infernal devices better then the mortal instruments series. I do love the other, but the story seems to be loosing its focus. I enjoys these characters more, as well. I do know how the story unfolds. I have two theories, which I will not say as to be spoiler free. Mild Spoiler I do think it is possible to love two ppl at a time, just not in the same manner, but with equal intensity. This is not the usual triangle that YA genre employs. Usually they throw instalove at us. Here, it is based on friendship with one and chemistry with the other. I enjoyed the hell outta this part of the story! I wanna know what the hell Tessa is.... I have theories on that as well... I wanna know if I am right! I love the new additions to the institute and I cant wait to see how they reek havoc on everyone. One I believe will be a calming influence and the person who showed up on the last page will cause issues with TessJem. I cant wait for it! :  its going to be a very long wait..... :
OMG, I have no words. This book was absolutely fantastic! Action packed to a whole new level, I just couldnt put it down. Its marvelous how Marissa can portray so many different characters and have them all speak up and stand out. Wolf and Scarlet are still my favorite couple, they truly show how the inside is what matters. Learn a lesson, Levana. Cress evolved a lot I think, she really steps up and is brave enough to help the revolution in spite of being afraid. True courage there. Her relationship with Thorne was not my favorite even though I love the characters because it lacks communication and they kind frustrated me a little. I mean, just tell her you love her, dude! But all in all, it was pretty sweet. Cinder and Kai are always perfect. Cinder goes through a lot of issues in this book, she has to deal with a whole planet and trying not to let anyone down. And Kai... sighs We already met Jacin, who at the beginning of the book seems a traitor to Cinders cause, but then we realize he is just trying to survive in order to protect Princess Winter. I just adore how much he loves her and is there for her every single time she needs him. Winter reminded me of Luna Lovegood because of her oddities, her special way of talking and because she is a little crazy but in a good way. Shes so sweet, I just want to hug her. The story follows the events after Cress, but I would recommend reading Fairest before Winter to have a better picture of Levana great evil character, I love it when they think they are right and people are just mean to them. I love how the story respects a story line so the events dont jump onto one another, its really harmonic. Our heroes suffer a lot, laugh a little less expected in the middle of a war, of course but dont lose themselves. I adored the evolution of each one of the characters from day one. I already miss them...! The ending of the war and Levanas final scene were a little flat for me because Im curious and it wasnt really explained WHAT happened, it was more makebelieve. Im buying it all right, but I would have liked to know more details about how things went down. The ending was an open one for me, and I enjoyed it because it was believable and realistic. You cant fix everything over a week, so it was a good ending. I would like to see the fate of our beloved characters, but I think well get that in Stars Above. All in all, Winter was an spectacular book to end the series and I loved every bit of it. 5 out of 5 stars for this jewel!
This review is also on my blog The Little Book Affair. I was really nervous going into this book because I know theres a lot of hype. Thats why I put it off for so long, but I figured with the second book out now its time I gave it a try. I liked this book, but I had some issues with it. The Wrath  the Dawn started off a bit slow for me but it definitely picked up. The writing was amazing. The descriptions were detailed enough to appeal to all of the senses but not so detailed that I wanted to skim the page. I think the writing itself is what helped me rate this book as high as I did. I thought the changing perspectives was a nice touch to the story, as it was interesting to see how the other people in Shahrzads life are handling her being the caliphs wife. Character wise, I liked all the characters except for Khalid and Sharhrzads dad. Something about Shahrzads dad really didnt sit right with me. And, I dont know, I just feel like even though we got the reason why Khalid kills all his wives at dawn I just couldnt justify the romance between him and Shahrzad. I get that Khalid loved her but it really sort of bothered me that Shahrzad went there to avenge her best friend. and then she falls in love with him after three days. I really felt like Ahdieh wrote Shahrzad to be smarter than that. That being said, I was still interested in the king and the romance between him and Shahrzad, I just didnt particularly like it. I loved Shahrzads character. I thought she was smart and witty. A lot of what she says and does makes sense when you remember shes only sixteen. I liked Shahrzads childhood friends, Tariq and Rahim. I thought they added some slight relief to a lot of the tension, and then they added a lot of tension when things were a little too relaxed. I thought they were great touch to the story, even if Tariq does create a little bit of a love triangle. For most of the book, though, I felt kind of meh about the whole thing. I think everything could have probably been wrapped up in one book, but Im intrigued enough to read the second one. Despite the issues I had with The Wrath  the Dawn I was still able to rate the book high because the writing and the characters really made the book what it was. It was still an enjoyable read. The book also got bonus points because theres a glossary in the back that I used several times throughout the book. I probably could have also benefited from a pronunciation chart as well.
I bloodydamn loved this book! Ok, Ill leave   The Golds dance in pairs, Obsidians in threes, Grays in dozens, he told me. We dance alone, because only alone do Helldivers drill. Only alone can a boy become a man. So Red Rising was an interesting book and a start to what I feel like is going to be a good scifi series. However, I do feel like this book was a bit slow  I found that it dragged most of the way through and nothing really happens until Cassius tries to kill Darrow and Mustang saves him. This book was just a lot of world building, which is something that I can totally understand as its the first book in the series. The world that Pierce Brown has set up in this book is very complex and I am excited to explore it more in the next two books when I do eventually get to them. However, when the action is present, it is executed beautifully and some of those action sequences are absolute gold  if there is one thing to be said about Pierce Brown, it is that he can write! I found the writing style in this to be unique and descriptive and I could picture everything that was going on so vividly in my head and, like I said before, THE ACTION SEQUENCES ARE ABSOLUTE GOLD! Another thing that Pierce Brown does right is characters  I found myself loving all the characters in this book  the relationships that the main character builds with the side characters all around him are so different from one another and that really intrigued me. Some people treat him like a brother, others look up to him, another person maybe unyieldingly loyal to him, other wink wink nudge nudge find it in their best interest to flirt with him. The main character is a leader, but the way Pierce Brown writes that leadership and the way it is executed is unlike anything Ive read before. Like, I cant remember the last time I read about a leader like that, if I ever have, so that was a breath of fresh air. So now that Ive said that, let me talk about the Proctors. In the book there are twelve houses, each named after a Roman god, competing for the prize. The Proctors of each house are referred to by the name of their house, i. e. Apollo, Ceres, Mars, Diana, etc. So throughout the book, whenever one of the proctors would be mentioned, I would immediately picture the Percy Jackson versions of those gods and it was kind of weird and sometimes the scenes I was picturing in my head got really out of hand, so... Please tell me I am not alone in this. Other than that, I ended up really hating most of the proctors in this game because well, they went against Darrow and also just like cheating and I know I shouldnt get mad about that, because stuff like that happens, but well. I JUST REALLY LOVE DARROW OK! So thats that. All together, I think its safe to say that I will definitely be continuing on with this series, but, at the moment, its not very high up on my priority list. I am intreseted to see where it will go though.
What do you do when you love someone with all your heart, but have to love yourself more? This has to be the most enlightening book that I have ever read. My perception has changed and I hope that it stays that way. I no longer want to see 2020. I want to see the naked truths. Thats one of the problems in our world, that we shy away from things we dont want to hear, or feel. We ignore them. Its easy to take the worst case scenario of a bad situation and make it the standard. It protects ourselves from caring or hurting. Now I get that none of this makes sense if you havent read this book and that it doesnt clearly identify what Im talking about. I dont want it to. If I recommend a book written by Colleen, I dont tell the person what its about. Thats how I feel her books are intended to be read, to receive the message fully. To say that this book is bold is and understatement. This books is a lifeline. Its as vital as your heart beating and the inhale of your next breath. It needs to be read in schools. It needs to be taught across the country. It needs to be TALKED about. I reserve a few books a year that will make me cry. Im not a big book crier. I hate it in fact. CoHos books are always the exception. I almost made it until the Authors note. The depths that Colleen had to search in her soul to push herself to write this book astonishes me. Thank you for doing that. I have learned a lesson from each book that Ive read by her. In Ugly Love I learned what it feels like to mourn, in November 9 I learned what it means to forgive and in this book I learned that your sacrifice for the greater good is always the right answer. I was blessed to have a wonderful friend send me this book. It delights me that she wanted to send it to me just because it made her happy. Thank you Shannon. It was also blessed to read this with a group of ladies that share my love for Colleen and her amazing writing. Dont worry, no spoilers ahead, but if you have read It Ends With Us then you know that Ellen DeGeneres names comes up quite frequently. I would love to see CoHo be invited to Ellens show. Maybe not right now as the book is about to come out and we dont want people to be spoiled by it, but I would love to see this book discussed on a national platform.
AH!! So in love with this freaking book its not even funny. Where to begin... Onyx contains waaay more Daemon than Obsidian, which was awesome. Onyx is full of major surprises, that I was not expecting at all. This book honestly made me love this series even more, and left me wanting even more. The ending is complete torture, I sat there after I finished and just stared at it going, WHAT THE BLEEP!?!?! OH MY GOD THAT CAN NOT BE IT!?!?! Oh oh and theres toe socks or as Daemon calls them mittens for your feet. Have to say I was super excited that those were in there, my boyfriend kept insisting I was the only dork in the world that wore those. So there, imaginary book people wear them too!!! Katy is still honestly one of my most favorite and idolized female heroine characters ever. She spends a lot of this book thinking about how she feels, and goes through some major changes. So she is also reaching some awesomeness. Daemon was even sexier in this book. While he still had his great moments of dickdom, for the most part he the sweet, caring, awesomesauce Daemon that Katy likes so much. He also kicks some major ars in this book. Seriously, his awesomeness was completely kick waay up in this book. There is a new guy in this book. I wont give too much away by talking about him, but hes super cute. Sadly Dee wasnt in this book as much, but my favorite scene was when she lit her boobs on fire. Which I swear I was laughing so hard at that part I started crying. Favorite Quote: This quote was insanely difficult to pick. I settled with this one since I couldnt put ALL of them on here. Plus this one remind me of when I get pie. How big of a piece of cake do you want? I pulled the cake out of the freezer. How big of a piece are you willing to part with? As big as you want. I grabbed a knife out of the drawer and sized up what I thought was a suitable piece for him. Bigger. He hovered over my shoulder. I moved the knife to the side. Even bigger. I rolled my eyes and moved it a couple inches. Perfect
Actual Rating: 4.5 Stars I really enjoyed this book a lot! Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda tells the story of Simon, a Georgia high school junior who has recently acquired an anonymous pen pal hes named Blue. Simon knows that Blue attends the same school as he does, and lives in the same town. Strictly through email interactions, Simon and Blues relationship provides a safe space for them both to discuss their deepest secrets without fear of judgement. When Simons emails to Blue are accidentally discovered, the delicate balance of their friendship and Simons secrets threaten to collapse around him. I think my favorite thing about this novel is that it felt very believable. I really felt as though I was hearing teenagers converse for the most part. The dialogue was modern without feeling like the author was stumbling through google translations of teen talk. I will mention though, I did not really understand the use of Tumblr as a main info source for our characters? I mean, ok. I use Tumblr, and have for many years now. As far as I know, Tumblr originally had a Palahniukesque motto similar to First rule of Tumblr is you dont talk about Tumblr. And you arent really posting status updates on Tumblr about your life like you are on Facebook or Instagram, not unless you have a ton of followers or something like that. So using this media platform as a main source of online interaction between our characters just didnt feel right? Because I maybe know a handful of the people I interact with on Tumblr, and I guess I assumed that was the standard. And all of the characters referred to it as The Tumblr which I have also never heard anyone say, ever. Correct me if Im wrong here but I certainly dont hear people saying The Facebook and it was really awkward to see it written that way in this book. Otherwise, I can only say that I really had a wonderful time with Simon and his story. I was able to relate my own past high school experiences to his 17yearold perspective. I often found myself smiling at Simons inner monologues, because Becky Albertalli was really able to capture how deeply you feel things when you are that age. How youre constantly wondering if your emotions are valid, if your choices are right, if those around you approve. It was fun to explore how being 17 can be both fantastic and terrible and all of the things in between. Plus it is always wonderful to see a diverse main cast. Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda is one of those books that I cant recommend enough. Its a lighthearted and entertaining tale of a boy navigating his personal discovery of self and how that self relates to those around him.
Originally Reviewed At: MotherGamerWriter Rating: 4 out of 5 Controllers Review Source: Publisher  NetGalley Reviewer: Ariel Seeker is the first book in a new series by Arwen Elys Dayton. Advertised towards fans of The Hunger Games and A Song of Ice and Fire, Seeker is a unique fantasy novel, one that shows a promising start to a new series. I, myself, still have not read The Hunger Games or A Song of Fire and Ice, so I cant say if the book will actually appeal to fans of either of those series, but I certainly enjoyed it for the most part. Quin Kincaid has trained her whole life to become a Seeker, along with her third cousin Shinobu, and John, the man she loves. However, the night Quin takes her oath, she discovers that being a Seeker is not at all what she thought it would be, and the people she trusts the most are the people she should be trusting the least. Starting with the things I liked about this particular novel, the concept was something I hadnt really heard of before. Seekers use an athame, in combination with a lightning rod to travel to any specific set of coordinates they wish. In their travels, they are to help those who have been wronged and to help out people who may be weak and in need. I enjoyed the plot of the novel and I was really excited to find out what it is these Seekers do. Another thing I enjoyed was the characters. The novel is told from four different perspectives: Quin, John, Shinobu, and Maud, the Young Dread. I think multiperspectival novels are really interesting when theyre done well and confusing when theyre done poorly. This one was done well, and it was nice getting so many different takes on what was going on. I think my favorite person to hear from was Maud, who doesnt become a narrator until part two of the book, I believe. Some things that I didnt like as much... It was very difficult for me to pin down a time period for this book. When Im reading, I want a set date in my mind, or at least a general idea. I started the novel thinking it took place somewhere in the medieval times, but at one point in the book, a cell phone is mentioned, as well as electricity, so it must be a lot more modern than I had originally thought. So, that was really confusing and took away some of the enjoyment out of the read. Another issue I had was the fact that the novel felt really slow. And it made me sad, because by all accounts, it shouldnt have felt slow at all. It isnt as though things werent happening. There was definitely a lot of action going on; it just took a while to get through. Also, Quin as a character I didnt care for so much. I liked her a lot at the beginning of the novel, and then after that I just had a hard time with her as the lead. I was much more interested in the other side characters than I was in Quin. All of this being said, however, I would still give Seeker 4 out of 5 controllers. Its a unique concept with an interesting plot, and it is still just the first in the series, so Im interested to see what happens next.
Whoa. Im starting out with the last word that escaped my mouth as I read the end of The Immortal Rules. I was so blown away by the entire package that Julie Kagawa presented, that I couldnt even form a coherent thought upon finishing. Lets be honest, Im a vampire lover. Always have been, always will be. Allisons story hooked me instantly. The gritty, dystopian and vampirerun world that she introduced me to felt so real. I didnt read this book, I devoured it. Allison Sekemoto is, in a word, fierce. Living in a world where she must fight to survive, Allison isnt afraid to stand up for herself. I fell in love with her sarcasm and wit. Even before she is turned you quickly find out that this is not a girl that you want to mess with. What really drew me in though was Allisons constant internal battle over becoming a vampire. She chooses her path willingly, and yet refuses to fall headfirst into the world that she hated so blatantly beforehand. Watching Allison fight her inner demons is fascinating, and it makes her that much more likable. In case you are worrying about the rest of the characters though, I can assure you that they are all just as vivid and well fleshed out as Allison! This I loved. Hands down, Kanin was my favorite. I wont spoil at all, but lets just say that I was eager for more of him. I know that this is the first in the series, and his time is coming. Coming in a close second was Zeke, who becomes a very important part of Allisons existence. This is a boy who totally stole my heart. Its hard not to fall for the chemistry between these two. However it was also so refreshing to see that Allison could keep her own identity at the same time. Thank you so much Julie Kagawa for giving us a girl who can be in love, but still take care of herself! I could honestly go on for pages about how much I truly enjoyed this book. The Immortal Rules just proves to me that Julie Kagawa can write anything she sets her mind to. Her storytelling is fantastic. Her characters are vivid and wonderful. Even the setting comes to life on its own. I cannot say enough about how amazing it all is. This book is over 400 pages, but it is an effortless read. The story blends into such seamless chapters that youll find yourself having read well past where you meant to stop. Long story short, I am putting this book on my favorites list for the year! Definitely give this one a read.
3.5 stars Naked Truth: I dont like this book as much as most people do. I dont find the plot nor characters interesting. I do feel that this is a very important story to tell. Lily Bloom falls in love with Ryle Kincaid, a neurosurgeon. She is plagued by her past of an abusive childhood, and his main focus is work. Even though they want different things from life the drift to each other. Then, Atlas Corrigan, her teenage lover, reappears and her whole life is threatened. How exactly will Atlas effect her present? Since I already said what I think about the novel, I will go on without repeating myself. Personally, I think that everyone, at some point in their life, should read this. It is a very powerful and informative novel, but also very graphic so I wouldnt advise teens to read it I know that I sound like a hypocrite,because I read it and I am a teen, but I truly believe that I could understand it better in the future. It touches on important topics like abuse. Moving on, Id like to say that I was not okay about how it ended. I think that Lilys choice about Ryle was realistic, but the choice about Atlas? No, no, no. It isnt realistic that she would move on so easily after a divorce that she wasnt sure about for half of the novel. I think that Atlas was not the right choice. She shouldve found a totally new person, because both Ryle and Atlas hurt her in the past. I think that her choice about Ryle, though it was the correct one to make, was very rushed and she shouldve made it a few months after Emmys birth to see Ryle as a father . This is a long term story. It takes place for about three years counting the epilogue. But it dragged and I got sick of the plot for a moment. Honestly, the only time that I was genuinely interested was while reading the authors note at the end, or the very beginning when I still was getting into it. It made me appreciate the story more and care about the characters and plot. I cant help but think that it would be that much better if it was a memoir of Colleen Hoovers childhood. I did appreciate the message and the awareness that is spread through the writing, though. That is the reason this book received the rating it got. It talks about things that are skimmed over in real life. Abuse between lovers is a topic not commonly talked about, but this made me have a revelation about the real world. It happens. People should really start acting up about it too. Also, this shows that rape isnt something that is always done to people in dark alleyways, but might happen at home, which is usually considered to be a safe place. Colleen Hoovers story wasnt the best in my opinion, but the message that she spread through her writing made a great impact on me and my thoughts.
Ive had Scarlet in my possession for a long time because I absolutely loved the first book Cinder by Marissa Meyer, which was one of the most fascinating and inventive spins on the Cinderella story Ive ever seen. Scarlet is a sort of adaptation of the Little Red Riding Hood story, and unsurprisingly, takes us to France, where it originated. We also get to see hints of Cinder and whats going on with her during this time as well. Scarlets grandmother is missing and it appears that she may be hiding secrets, which is why she was abducted in the first place, and Scarlet is determined to find her. Along the way, she meets a rugged fighter named Wolf, who she finds herself drawn to in more ways than one. At the same time Cinder is trying to escape prison, and does so, with a dashing convict, Thorne, who is probably my newest favorite character in the series. These two stories finally collide at the end, and we are set up for Cress, the next installment. The best parts of the book are about Cinder, who still remains a great character with an intriguing backstory, one that we find out more in this book, as well as get introduced to the new character Thorne, who is hilarious and hot at the same time. Hes this worlds bad boy, and you cant help but love him. The writing is still great, and we also see glimpses of poor Kai as he struggles to keep his world together against the evil Levana. At the end, I definitely wanted to pick up Cress immediately! That said, I really had trouble with the Scarlet half of the story. This part for me really dragged because the whole thing could be summarized in a line or two missing Grandmother, new love interest Wolf introduced, find Grandmother. Theres really no more to her story than that until we reach the end. It definitely felt like filler, and she and Wolf werent interesting enough by themselves to carry the story. Overall, I think this book is not as compelling as the first, but is mostly important to find out Cinders backstory, which is essential. Thorne is a great addition, and Meyer is undeniably a talented author. Theres no doubt in my mind that Ill be picking up Cress to see what happens to these characters.
Check out my book blog for more reviews! First of all: If you just read that description and was put off by the whole brother and sister romance thing, please keep reading anyway. It truly is an amazing book, written in a way that makes you unsure of why incest is such a taboo subject. Of course, theres the fact that you have a big chance of having disabled children, but I personally think that you should be allowed to love whoever you want to love, and be in a relationship with them as long as the other person wants it too. Enough of my opinion on all that stuff, lets talk about the book! Forbidden is told in alternating perspectives from Lochan and Maya. Sometimes it was hard to remember whose perspective I was reading, and I found myself flipping back to the first page of the chapter to remind myself. I like my characters to be written realistically and interesting, and all of the characters in this book were like that. I loved the little siblingsKit, Tiffin, and Willaand of course, the two main characters. Their mother was awful. Not badly written, but she was just... a terrible person. I liked the way Lochan thought about Maya. Not in a Oh I Love You Lets Be Together Forever And Stuffkind of way. He always knew that it was wrong what they were doing and feeling. He was my favourite character, because he was the most developed one in the book. He has extreme social anxiety: he cant talk to anyone except for the people in his family, and he has severe flaws, which makes him more realistic and likeable. I didnt like Maya as much. She was kind of the typical teen girl, and she doesnt feel conflicted about falling in love with her brother very much, not enough at least. The writing was beautiful, very detailed and poetic. At first it kind of annoyed me because it was a little overdetailed, but after a while I got used to it. There was maybe one thing I disliked about this book: the cheesy lines. Maya keeps calling Lochan my love, which is just... Just, no. And Together, were strong. Who actually says that?! Okay, moving on. Overall, Forbidden was dark, heartbreaking, and just... really good. The plot was super original. One last thing. There are a lot of things going on in this book. It deals with child abuse and incest, and there is a sex scene in it thats pretty graphic. If youre not mature enough to deal with the sexy times, dont read it. Blog post: 
I dont even know where to begin, I always find it so hard to review the books that I absolutely loved, and this one is no exception. Im not sure how well I will be able to convey my love for this book in my review, but I will try. This is the first book that Ive read by Heather Demetrios, but I can guarantee that it wont be my last. This book completely hooked me from the very beginning and it didnt let up once until the very last page. Even then, I found myself going back and thinking about this story. The writing is so amazing and everything feels so real. Sure, the characters arent perfect, but who is? And they dont have the perfect lives, but who does? No one, and that is one reason that made me love them so much. They are flawed, and they make mistakes, but we all do. The point of making mistakes are learning from them and I feel like they do, that made them feel more real and relatable. I absolutely loved the characters in this story. Skylar was so easy to like, shes loyal, smart, creative and she knows exactly who she is, and she doesnt let anyone pressure her to be something shes not. Sure, she has flaws, but shes smart enough to not make the same mistakes twice. Josh, oh what can I say about Josh? He is a character that really has a lot going on, he just got back from Afghanistan, minus a leg, and he has a hell of a lot of baggage, but he makes it so easy to love him. I also loved the side characters as well, Dylan, Chris and Marge, they all were special in their own way and I feel like they were all there for Sky when she needed them, and that is hard to find now days. Ill Meet You There is a wonderful story about finding yourself, learning from your mistakes, and realizing that sometimes your family doesnt have to be related to you. With that said, its also a heartbreaking story and there are some dark moments when Josh narrates, but his is a story that needs to be told. What he goes through is a harsh reality of what its like for soldiers and I applaud Demetrios for taking on such a tough subject, and for doing it with such compassion. Joshs story is one that will stay with me for a long time.
I was on the fence with Undeniable, but Unbeautifully completely pushed me over the edge. Seeing the added story to Eva and Deuces time after all the Frankie mess made me appreciate the first book more as well. Rippers struggles are the kind that just tear you apart from the inside. A boy that lost everything given a chance to have a new family of brothers  then horribly damaged and wishing he had just died that night. But enter Danny. Danny is Deuces daughter. She is all things frilly and pink. But she is torn with her father who is never around, a mother that left her, Eva who is broken and having to step up to help with Ivy. She needs an escape  something to make her happy. Well hello there Ripper. Youre nothin but fuckin beauty and Im a whole lot of fuckin ugly whos already halfway to hell. But he was wrong. Everything has beauty. Even the ugly. Especially the ugly. Because without ugly, there would be no beauty. Because without beauty, we would not survive our pain, our sorrow, and our suffering. Ripper was badly scarred by Frankie, his flesh cut, torn into but there is something about him that Danny sees. She sees beyond his scars and sees him as beautiful. But with Danny being the Prez daughter she is off limits. Ripper knows that he is just asking for a bullet by messing with her but he cant seem to get her out of his head. She is not the girl that you just have sex with. She is the girl you put on your bike  the kind you make your old lady. She is not a club whore. He cant have her. But she is the only thing that makes him forget about the pain. When things get complicated he leaves. He knows she deserves better and the only way for her to move on is if he is gone. But staying gone is not always in the cards and upon his return he realizes that leaving was the biggest mistake. Not only do we get to see a tormented side of Ripper that just crushes your heart, we get a glimpse into struggle with Eva and Deuce after the Frankie bullshit and before the HEA. That little added insight really made me rethink my feelings on book one. We also see the struggle the other boys in the club. We get a piece of all of them as the story continues and each one starts to grow on you a little more than before. The ones that you overlooked in book one are suddenly brought forward in book 2 and it just makes you want to know their story even more. Even though Ripper is the most physically damaged of the group, he was beyond hot. Something about his damaged exterior made him seem so much more appealing. When left without the exterior beauty to rely on we got to see the parts of him that really matter. The lone wolf after his parents died, the brotherhood of the MC, the way he loved Danny and the way he finally saw himself.
Originally posted on Le Book Chronicles Blog So, I had heard a fair bit about this book, and it was on a lot of peoples top 10 favourites of 2015, so I figured I would give it a go. Now, I mainly read contemporary books. By mainly, I mean I solely read contemporary books. So The Martian was quite different for me considering it is a Science Fiction book. I had heard that there was a lot of sciencey stuff in it, but that it was so funny you could overlook all the science stuff. But that wasnt really true for me. I did think it was funny, and I did enjoy the book but the science aspect of it was so damn boring for me and considering about 95 of the book contained science lingo, it made the book quite a boring read. I think that for someone who is interested in Science and space, this book would be fantastic. Personally, I preferred the movie so much more. I think Matt Damon did a really good job of playing Mark Watney and everything just made so much more sense than in the book. Mark Watney was a very interesting character. I loved his sense of humour, it was very sarcastic which is kind of like me. But I also loved how he dealt with things that happened. That aspect of it was pretty entertaining to me. I also think a part of me not enjoying the books as much was because I listened to it on audio book. At the start, it was really helpful listening to it because of the science lingo stuff that was happening, but after a while when you started getting the different P.O.Vs from NASA and from the crew, it all got a bit confusing who was who. So for that part, I think reading the actual book is much better over the audiobook. I do think this is a book anyone could enjoy, however if youre like me and have no interest in the science aspect of it, maybe go for something else. It still boggles my mind how so many people who normally read contemporary have marked this as their favourite book ever. I just dont understand. Anyway, thats all I really have to say. Im interested to know if you read this and if you were like me and didnt enjoy it all that much, or if it is now one of your favourites. Let me know! Would I recommend? Yes If you are interested in reading this book but dont want to spend the money. There is actually a free version online as at the end of the book, it states that Redistribution of this ebook is permitted, so long as it is distributed for free. So there you have it. You can download the book here. Youre welcome : Overall Rating: 35
Enter to win an ARC of Cress at Scott Reads It! Cress was one of my most anticipated books of 2014 and so, I did a gleeful dance when it arrived in the mail. I really didnt know how Meyer could top the absolutely amazing Cinder and Scarlet, both of which are two of my alltime favorite books. Cress is definitely Marissa Meyers best book to date and it upsets me how there is only one more book left in this series Winter. Cress, the titular character is probably my favorite character from The Lunar Chronicles at the moment. Cress is nothing like Cinder or Scarlet: shes much more awkward, insecure, and introverted than the two aforementioned characters. Cress has a completely different character than most characters you see in YA; its rare to see a main character in YA who is extremely reserved and much rather spend time with technology. Not to mention the fact that Cress is a total fangirl for Thorne and she is so freaking adorable! Cress is a much longer novel than both Cinder and Scarlet which worried me slightly because I dont have the longest attention span. While reading Cress, I didnt feel like I was reading a book that is nearly 600 pages because I couldnt stop reading. The entire novel moves at a lightening fast speed and there arent any slowpaced sections in Cress. Marissa Meyers creative worldbuilding, witty dialogue and extremely lovable characters easily secure Cress a spot on my Favorites shelf. The romance in Cress is beyond amazing and its just what fans have been waiting for! In Scarlet, I was disappointed with the lack of CinderKai interactions and I missed everyones favorite Prince. There is so much more of a focus on Kai in Cress and I loved watching him respond to the entire Levana crisis. I also was a huge fan of Scarlet and Wolfs relationship in Cress and I really hope those two get the happy ending they deserve in Cress. In addition, I was really impressed with the way that Meyer handled the CressThorne romance angle. I really loved seeing Cresss obsession with Thorne turn into a budding romance. My love for Cress is absolutely boundless and I am extremely obsessed with this book! Despite the fact that my toread pile is mountainous, I loved Cress so much that Im thinking of rereading it soon. Cress is another mesmerizing installment in The Lunar Chronicles and its heartbreaking that I have to wait so long to read Winter. Cress is one of the best books Ive read this year by far, Marissa Meyer outdid herself once again!
Not surprisingly, One Summer: America, 1927 is a history of the various activities that were taking place around the US during the summer of that year. Key events, people and topics that Bryson covers in some detail include: Charles Lindberghs flight across the Atlantic and aviation in general, the scandalous murder trial of Judith Snyder and Judd Gray, prohibition, Herbert Hoover, Babe Ruth, Al Capone, the transition from silent to talking film and Henry Ford. I enjoy Brysons writing quite a bit, particularly his later books that deal with science and history his earlier travel books, while often amusing, seem to unfailingly degrade into a dull if persistent whine. One Summer exhibits quite a bit of painstaking research, is well written, and kept me interested throughout. Bryson makes history fun and could probably publish a phonebook in a way that would be compelling to read. Though One Summer can be favorably compared with other history books, in terms of Brysons other writing, I thought it lacked the liveliness and humor of his other work. Though hard to put my finger on Id say the major contributing factors were that the book featured less of Brysons dry wit and the fact that I just didnt find the subject matter to be particularly compelling. This might be due in part to the fact that the book lacks a strong organizing principle. Unlike some of his other work such as At Home that centers around a tour of his English home, or A Short History of Nearly Everything that examines the history of scientific discoveries, One Summer uses the relatively weak theme of events that occurred over the course of a year. But quite a lot happens within a country as large as the US in this timeframe, and most of these things are completely unrelated to one another. In order to capture these events, Bryson shifts the narrative of the book abruptly between the dissimilar topics of Ruth and Mt. Rushmore, flag pole sitting and prohibition, Coolidge and Capone, in a distracting fashion. Though Bryson attempts to ease these transitions by returning to chronicle the life of Charles Lindbergh throughout the book, this turns out to be a rather weak thread with which to bind the story. Lest I leave too negative an impression, let me say again that the book is really quite good and well worth reading. Bryson has set a high bar with his other work and this one just doesnt measure up.
I hella  HELLA  enjoyed this book. Much more than I anticipated I would. I never expected a scifi twist on the fairytale I am well familiar with would turn out to be this fantastically EPIC?! Cinder is, as stated in the synopsis, a cyborg, subjected to cruelty and unfair injustices by society and her motherstepsister. This book was so gripping, and I kept getting really excited when I found parallels between this book and the Cinderella stories the Hans Christian Andersen version, the Grimm version, and the Disney, and this is just another spin on a classic. A better spin, in my modern opinion. And that ending! It had me absolutely REELING. I cannot except it. There has to be more. NEEDS to be more. Cinder was totally badass, not gonna lie. She started off as timid and fearful, as being such a ridiculed person in her city as well as her home, and I couldnt help but feel pity for her. It was clear she worked hard and the way she was being treated honestly really pissed me off. You know those moments where you feel for the protagonist so much you want to jump into the book world and scream and swear at the other characters and you have this instinctive need to protect the protagonist?!?! Yeah thats how I felt. bUT LET ME TELL YOU CINDER DID NOT NEED PROTECTING NO SIREE SHE GOT THIS HANDLED SO FAST WOO Also Kai. Ugh, sweet, naive little Kaito. As the prince, Kai is obviously the desire of all the girls in the land. Even cyborgs. And believe me I pictured him as a less buff and more pure and innocent Taylor Lautner, and believe me I was swooning all the way home. Toward the end of the novel, my eyes were racing through the page, and honestly I had to keep going back  which pissed me off because my inability to be PATIENT  because I would be so caught up in the story and skip full lines because I had to know what on Luna was going to happen next?! GET IT OMG IM SO FUNNY And the ending did not disappoint! Honestly the plot twist at the end was sort of predictable but I mean IT WAS STILL GREAT AND MUCH NEEDED FOR THE COURSE OF THE STORY. Final Thoughts: this book is great and wonderful and an amazing initial novel for a series with such potential and promise! the premise is so unique and i highly HIGHLY recommend it for EVERYONE. go read it now ok bye.
IM INLOVE. IM TOTALLY AND ENGAGINGLY INLOVE WITH THIS BOOK. THE WAY IT HAS TWISTED MY MIND IS UNBEARABLY AND AMAZINGLY UNFORGETTABLE! This is a complicated yet creative novel in which the author theoretically depicts the reality that divides our world in the present day or in the near future. When people decide and learn that democracy and autocracy Political ideologies, Catholicism, Christianity and Islam Religion, Bourgeoisie and Proletariat Social Classes or even Japanese and Filipino Races, Languages and Culture are not the ones that cause DISRUPTION and break the UNITY in this world, it is the HUMAN behavior and attitude. So the world will simply be divided into FIVE 5 major factions: The SELFLESS, the HONEST, the PEACEFUL, the BRAVE and the INTELLIGENT and somewhere in the middle lies the faction of the DIVERGENT. And through these factions, we will learn to see the real faces of the government. The book also speaks about LEADERS and how to choose them. I found this excerpt about leaders very interesting: My father says that those who want power and get it live in terror of losing it. That is why we have to give power to those who do not want it. I was like YES!! CORRECT!! hoho. There are so many enthralling and mindboggling things about this novel that is why I cant simply put it into words. But once the excitement and the feeling of OMG, I CANT WAIT TO WRITE SO MANY THINGS ABOUT THIS NOVEL!! worms out. Ill edit this review.haha! :p Surprisingly, the book made me like its short love story. Well, its not that I dont like love stories but I usually do not appreciate romance when talking about serious issues and violence. Lol. I sometimes hate having to squeeze a romance in the novel to make the book complete. But I was there with it. I liked both characters, especially Four 3; I wanted their relationship to work out. THE FEELING I HAD WHILE READING THEIR LOVE ESCAPADE IS TOTALLY NOT ME. Haha! And for Tris, the protagonist of the story, she becomes increasingly hard, selfish and brave as the novel moves on...and that sort of made me think; A person today cannot live selflessly in a competitive world and that, though others really matter, sometimes you have to put yourself first. The only sad thing about this novel is that it didnt give the absolute significance of what a DIVERGENT is. Why is there a DIVERGENT? I get how the Divergent people get through with the initiation and simulation of factions but, isnt it too much to put focus on? Nevertheless, the novel grabbed me with a HUGE HOOK and it left me hanging.. so, I will look forward to read the INSURGENT and the LAST BOOK which will be published next year :
Less Reality More Books Short version: I loved this book. I loved the characters, the setting, the intrigue of the Grisha and their unique powers and their political standing and power within the palace. I loved our main character, Alina, and the turmoil she goes through during the story. I sat down to start this book and had it devoured three days later. It was impossible to stop reading. Long version: This is a world divided into ordinary people and those born with unique powers, called the Grisha. This story follows an exceptionally ordinary and notveryspecial girl called Alina, a map maker in the Kings First Army. Shes been an orphan her whole life, but never truly alone as she was always with her childhood best friend, Mal, who is a tracker in the Army. Everyone in the army is afraid of entering an area called the Fold, which was created centuries ago to divide certain different regions and is pitch black. There are winged creatures that live in the Fold called Volcra that hunt anyone foolish enough to enter the Fold unprepared. When the First Army has no choice but to enter the Fold, everyone is attacked by these Volcra but they are saved a miraculous beam of light that scared all the Volcra away. It turns out that Alina has had a Grisha power hidden deep inside her entire life, but it has finally been released to save herself and Mal. However, once this has been discovered, a powerful Grisha known simply as the Darkling, who is second to the King, takes Alina away from everything she knows and to the Little Palace, where she is to be trained to understand her power and help get rid of the Fold once and for all. First off, The Darkling. You get a sense straight away that he is hiding a lot of secrets but you dont care because he is the perfect antihero and they are my downfall. He was pulling some seriously shady decisions and it was impossible to know if he could truly be trusted, but that didnt stop me from falling hard for him completely. Whenever he and Alina were together I just got goose bumps and felt as confused as Alina did. Alina is a really strong, stubborn female lead who is instantly likable and great to read about. While she does experience that YA trope of ordinary girl discovers she isnt ordinary but extra super special, this was written in 2012 when that wasnt as overused, but more than that, it is written well. That makes all the difference. She was witty and relatable and just trying to get through her new life as best she can. I also loved her friendship with Genya, which felt so genuine, and I hope we see more of her in the coming books. Mal is her childhood best friend and also the boy she fell in love with at fifteen. And while he is good and kind and understands Alina like no one else and makes her feel less alone, he doesnt bring the emotion like the Darkling does. In every one of these love triangles, its always the brooding antihero that wins my heart in the end. Sorry Mal. This book attached itself to my heart in a way I havent read about in a long time, and I cannot wait to jump back into book 2 and keep reading about these fantastic characters and intriguing world. Im so moving on Six of Crows after this!
This is the debut novel of Mark Lawrence. Ive seen it on the shelves of bookstores and on Amazon for a while now, floating around my recommendation lists. I havent been that interested in it. The hooded man with sword cover has been done to death, and it sure as hell didnt shout out to me Read me, Im awesome. When the Best of 2011 lists started showing up and most had Prince of Thorns on it, I decided it should be worth my while. Boy, am I lucky I listened to myself. The setting of Prince of Thorns is a broken Empire, with everyone who has a claim competing for the throne. Its been going on for generations, with no end in sight. The story is told from the viewpoint of Prince Jorg, who, when we meet him, leads a band of criminals and highwaymen on a spree of murder and mayhem. And all that at thirteen. They rape, pillage, murder and do all the dark deeds that could be thought off. Now Jorg as a thirteen year old bloodthirsty highwayman was a cause for me to pause and groan. I hate it when the hero is basically a teenager and he is the bestest and brightest in all that he does. He does impossible things on a regular basis in the book, and it almost spoiled it for me. However, it all gets explained in quite a satisfactory way towards the end of the novel, which made me enjoy it a million times more. The story is action packed, delivering fight scenes and normal conversation with fast pacing and a bit of insanity. The setting is one I quite enjoyed. It hasnt been used to death and the setting alone promises to influence the way the story will unfold in the future. I wont spoil it for you, but that alone is worth a read. Jorg is a bastard, but the book is full of bastards and at least Jorg is a lovable bugger underneath all his faults and hurts. He even eats a heart, and I still like him. There are magic in the world, but it isnt the focus or that important in this novel. Im sure that it will be included into the story a bit more in the next installment, but I didnt miss it. The only big faults with this book? Well, I dont really care about the cover at all. And I wish Ive read it sooner. Thats about it really. Is it worth a read? Hell yes. 810
Words We Love By There are absolutely no adjectives to describe the beauty of this book. The lush, verdant, fragrant and infinitely romantic story, let me simulate falling in love again, for the first time, for the last time. And even now, days after I finished reading, it sets my heart racing to think about Khalid and Shahrzad. How improbable their story is. And so, how magnificent it was to watch these two unable to stop the super nova sized pull between them that made them go from enemies to lovers. I am a great fan of the 1001 Arabian Nights legend. Of the young girl who warded off death each dawn by telling the murderous caliph a story each night that captivated him enough to want to hear more the next evening. In this retelling, we are transported to the kingdom of Khourastan, city of Rey where a young woman, Shahrzad, with a brave heart and reckless spirit enters a lions den to avenge her best friends murder. Her nemesis a monster, a boy king who for the last few month has married a different girl every night and murdered her dawn. Shahrzad is determined to have her revenge. She leaves her childhood love, her family and marches towards her destiny with unflinching certainty in the righteousness of her cause. Khalid is a tortured young man. His suffering is great. His guilt, immeasurable. And yet, when he lays eyes on this particular young woman, who volunteered for her own demise, he is captivated by her strength, her honesty and her beauty. In her, he feels the possibility of hope and he allows himself to indulge in what he has long denied himselfhappiness. Their courtships is a clash of wills. But neither are strong enough to defy destiny. Yet, there are forces at work that will prove to be powerful foes of the couple and when this book ends, I was left feeling strangely uplifted, even though it ends with uncertainty for the young couple. It has been years since I have been so lost in a story. Ms. Ahdieh is a poet. A master wordsmith. She creates a world that you can smell, feel and taste. The writing is exquisite. I think that the setting, the fantasy allowed her to create a love so large and epic that it feels other worldly. If I could give this 500 stars, I would. My review for The Rose and the Dagger will publish at the same time as this does. I highly, highly recommend them both.This review was originally posted on Words We Love By
SO GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDD!!!!! Find more of my reviews on my blog, The Readers Antidote The Immortal Rules is the perfect combination of a dystopian, the hierarchy of vampire society, rabid zombies, and the need of survival. Kagawa is brilliant once again and has made me love her books for a whole other reason. I must admit Im a little wary of vampire books now. Ive loved Twilight and Vampire Academy, but I stay away from lesser vampire books as a general rule. Luckily, The Immortal Rules is not a lesser vampire novel. I knew I wanted to read anything that Kagawa writes from now on as soon as I finished the Iron Fey series. Her writing has really grown since the first book in her fey series came out, and The Immortal Rules is a testament to that. I was a little unsure, but once I got into this one, I didnt want to stop. There was so much heartache. Allie, our main character, starts out as a street rat, one of the few remaining unregistered humans that havent been turned rabid or used as pets by the ruling vampires. Shes a survivor, taking care of her group and herself without any adults. One day as shes scouring emptied houses for food, she stumbles upon a shack in a backyard that has a basement filled to the brim with food. But when she brings the other three members of their little gang, things dont go as planned. Allie is left on the brink of death, and a vampire that she met in a sewer the night before has offered her a different kind of death; where she can be a vampire. From here on its nothing but action. At first, Kanin, Allies sire, teaches her everything he knows about being a vampire. But when Kanin and Allie find themselves in trouble, Kanin forces Allie to leave him. Allie is still getting used to being a vampire, so when shes wandering and comes upon a couple humans, she cant help herself. Then she meets Jeb and his followers, and she finds Zeke. This is where it really picked up for me. You all know how I love my romance, so when things started changing between Zeke and Allison, I couldnt stop reading. There was so much heartbreak in this one relationship, I dont know if I can take any more. We were certainly left off wondering a lot of things. I absolutely loved The Immortal Rules. I need the next one, like now! Kagawas writing is much grittier and bleak in this book, but I think that made me love it even more. Kagawa has created a scary, troubling world where anything can happen. I cannot wait for the next one!
Well I raced through that in one sitting. As someone who lives in Connecticut  within an hour from Sandy Hook, with friends who live there  this hits particularly kind of literally close to home. It was heartbreaking and terrifying and every other synonym. I dont have words yet.  Full review: Whew, this book was not easy. I raced through it in one sitting on a Saturday night and was desperate to see how it all ended. Heartbreaking, terrifying, and real. This wont be an easy review. Im a Connecticut resident and live about an hour from Sandy Hook... plus I have a friend who is a teacher in that town. Needless to say, this book hit entirely too close to home literally. School shootings are something that really scare me more than I can express. When I was younger I read books about Columbine and in high school I read Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult. I dont know why, but these stories have always grabbed me. Maybe because it feels like your biggest fear realized. Aside from my personal connection and interest, this book was incredibly wellwritten and welldone. I sat on my couch and finished it within a couple of hours; I couldnt stop. The book centers around an hour long period, from when the shooting starts until it ends. There are four main characters whose POVs get alternated between: Sylvia, Autumn, Tomas, and Claire. I wont get too much into their relationships to each other and how they related to the shooter, but they were all definitely connected. I was nervous about all of these characters and their relationships at first, but I finally got the hang of it. Despite the constant POV changes, I really felt like I knew these characters. Maybe its because in your moments of extreme fear and turmoil, youre the most honest with yourself. They reflected on their lives and their futures while trying to deal with the terrible situation they were faced with. Even though the book was told in such a short time frame with multiple characters, I really felt their emotions and some of their personalities. Yeah, this book was heartbreaking. You know that innocent people are going to die. I obviously wish certain people didnt, but its inevitable. I wont spoil anything about the ending or characters. Regardless, I cant exactly put into words how this book made me feel. On edge, sad, terrified, heartbroken... I dont know. This story felt so real and was so wellwritten; I really cant think of a single flaw to take this rating down a notch. Id highly recommend this book if youre in the market for a more serious read. This could easily be required reading at schools although Im not sure if that would work out.
Taking a break from the series after Lover Awakened was a smart move for me. Z and Bella are one of my alltime favorite couples and their story was too emotional and beautiful, so I needed some time to gather my thoughts and emotions between books 3 and 4. It took me a while to get back to BDB, but Im glad I waited because it wasnt hard for me to get involved in Lover Revealed after the break which probably wouldnt be the case if I read them one after the other. This way, I gave it my full attention and enjoyed it very, very much. I fell in love with Butch in Dark Lover. I dont know why, but as soon as he showed up he instantly became one of my favorite characters in BDB series. In fact, he stands shoulder to shoulder with Zsadist on my personal sexytorturedcharminglovablemen throne. Maybe its the fact that he was an outsider in the vampire world, or that crazy vibe around him  I dont care, either way I love him. No need to say that Lover Revealed was a treat for me and that I enjoyed his story so, so much! I have to be honest, I agree with all those fans who were rooting for ButchVishous pairing. Those two have such a beautiful relationship and from the moment they met there was this special bond between them. I really wanted them together, but oh well... J. R. Ward obviously had other plans. Dont get me wrong, I liked Butch and Marissa together, but... Yeah, its a shame to dismiss that powerful BV chemistry. Other than that whole V thing, Butch and Marissa were great together. Ever since Butch confessed sitting in the bushes under her window in Lover Eternal, I knew they would end up together. Their whole story was lovely and I really liked how they handled everything. Their feelings were so obvious and strong from the very first time they met and I liked how sure they were about each other, against all complications with him being human and all that aristocracy stuff on her side. First sex scene was great. Well, not great, but it was realistic and well written. I liked that. Butchs abduction and everything that followed was pretty interesting. Omega finally made a big move and it was dark and dangerous and it changed a lot in BDB world. I loved that. It kept me guessing through the whole story about what will happen in the end. And the ending... Oh wow. Epic! I loved it so, so much. Maybe thats because Butch has a special place in my heart, but I think he deserves every bit of it. Its not over yet, I know, but for now, I am more than happy about his destiny. Yay! It was nice to see John Matthew again. His chapters were interesting and I am looking forward to finding more about him. This series is really great, one of my favorites. Lover revealed is a 5 star book for me, just like Lover Awakened was. V is next. Cant wait!
To the stars who listenand the dreams that are answered. OH. MY. GOODNESS. I must admit, I had the highest expectations for this novel because I was such a fan of the first novel, and Sarah J. Maas exceeded those expectations, triumphantly. From start to finish I felt a part of each and every moment. I cant believe how drastically my feelings changed for certain characters as this novel went on. I usually can predict where the author leads the story, but Sarah J. Maas surprised me with every page I turned. Each chapter I wanted more and more. I absolutely fell in love with the first novel, and I didnt think it was possible for a book to overpass those feelings and passion. But A Court of Mist and Fury, did just that. Feyre became a whole new person  Strong, independent, brave. She learned to stand up for herself, began to embrace her new form of self, and lead herself on a whole new journey with a list of freshfaced characters that absolutely stole my heart. I think I fell utterly in love with Rhysand in this novel. Spoilers may be ahead, please be warned. We learned his story, more about his character. He was vulnerable, loving, absolutely charming without a doubt. I cant express enough how much I love his and Feyres relationship, their bond. They shared so much passion and love for one another, I havent seen such a connection between two characters in awhile. I was rooting for them to be together the whole time. I remember how much I loved her and Tamlin together in the previous book. Oh, how Sarah J. Maas swayed me. Under the Mountain had changed these characters to no end. Feyre thought she wanted Tamlin, but in the end needed Rhys. It was inevitable. A Court of Mist and Fury was brilliant. From beginning to end. And can we discuss the ending for a second?! Oh, my word. The next novel has so many options for the storyline, after how it concluded in this one. Im in shock over what happened  absolutely insane, breathtaking. I still have no words. You are my salvation, Feyre. 55. I give this novel all of the stars of the Night Court. UGH, Im in love. And I will be waiting excitedly for the third book of this series. Sarah J. Maas never disappoints.
3.5 stars Ive read all of Lauren Olivers YA books except Requiem and Ive always enjoyed her books. She has such a distinct style and vibe to her books. I feel like even if her name wasnt on the cover, once I started reading the book, I could tell for sure that it was a Lauren Oliver book. I think all her books have mixed reviews and its kind of a toss up if someone will love or hate her books. I personally like her standalones way more then the Delirium series and even though I seen a lot of mixed her reviews for Vanishing Girls, I knew that Id want to it no matter what. Lauren is definitely an auto buy author for me. I definitely think Vanishing Girls was exactly what I thought it was going to be and I liked it exactly how much I thought that I would. Its hard to explain how I feel about Vanishing Girls because its very Young Adult in a way that I didnt find to have a whole of anything. I felt like the plot was all over the place and disorganized. So insanely messy. It bounced from Daras POV to Nicks. From website posts to personal messages to diary entries. From before to after. Just a whole lot of mess. I had a hard time keeping things in order in my head and towards the last half of the book, I felt really frustrated because I couldnt remember what was going on and I just really wanted to know what was happening. Every time I picked this book up, it felt like starting a tv show in the middle of season 5. The writing style was so Lauren Oliver. On one hand, it was nice to feel already comfortable with the writing style but on the other hand, I wanted something new and different. If youve read Laurens books in the past and didnt like the writing style, you wont like Vanishing Girls. The characters are fairly good. I liked Nick a lot more over Dara, just because I couldnt stand Daras attitude and I felt like she was written with the sole purpose to be disliked by the reader. I couldnt understand her reasoning for the things she did and I was frustrated with her 100 of the time. The pace was really quick. I was able to buzz though this book fairly fast. There wasnt a whole lot of boring parts but I felt like the first half was kind of slow. Overall, Vanishing Girls was a pretty good read. I enjoyed it for most part. Its not my favorite book by Lauren but I still liked it. The plot was pretty empty of substance and it was confusing at times. It actually reminded me a lot of Pretty Little Liars. Entertaining but not the most intricate.
Three years ago one of my campers recommended this book to me, and I wish I listened to her and read this sooner! This book was incredible! The writing, the characters, the messages. Everything was fantastic. I teared up so many times throughout this book, both from sadness and from being touched and happy. I love all of these characters! Auggie is such a sweetheart and I love the way he was written. While I cannot truly speak on this, I feel like it was great representation. His character isso sweet and kind, and I love his sense of humor. I also love his parents. While we dont get to see into their head, I feel as if we know them and I really felt for them as having to deal with a child that has the issues that Auggie does. Via was amazing as well. I loved being able to get into the mind of the sister of someone like Auggie. I like that we got to see her struggle with her feelings and acceptance. She seemed very real, and I truly felt for her throughout the book. Also her boyfriend Justin is a sweetheart. Jack and Summer are such great friends! I was really mad at Jack over what happened on Halloween, and so I love that we got to see his side of everything. It doesnt justify what he said, but I can understand it. Being in fifth grade is rough and it can become very important to be popular. Many people in real life make stupid decisions based on this. Im just happy that Jack was able to recognize his and fix it. Hes a good kid who made a stupid mistake, just like Auggie, I can forgive him for it. And I love that Summer was the opposite! Someone who right away said, screw it, Im going to be friends with who I want to be friends with! I also grew to love the other kids in the school, minus Julian of course. The only person besides Julian that I didnt like was Miranda. I think she seems like a terrible friend, and honestly, nothing she did redeemed her. Shes selfish, and even though I feel bad for her, I think Via deserves better. Overall this was an incredible story with an amazing message and I think everyone should read it! Famous last words, but... Im kind of excited for the movie! Lets hope they dont ruin this masterpiece!
Alright, Im a bit upset with myself. I read this thinking I wouldnt like it much, but I loved it and now I have to wait a year for the next one to come out! I havent read many books that deal with time travel  I think the last one, that I can remember, was The Time Travelers Wife and that was some time ago. When I watch movies or shows with it, sometimes it can be confusing with some concepts and Ive never been sure if its me or what Im watching. It was like this in the beginning with Passenger  a few things were confusing to me, like the idea of a person being orphaned from their timeline. By the end, though, it was explained a lot better and things finally clicked. I only wish it had started that clear. Honestly, though, besides my slight confusion in the beginning, this was a great book. I really enjoyed the story  with certain families having the ability to travel, pirates, searching for this ancient heirloom. Theres more story than action in this book, which is perfectly fine with me. Its a slower moving plot, I think its really preparing us for whats to come, but it kept me interested from start to finish. I fell in love with the characters, too. All of them. Nicholas just made my heart melt, Etta was tough and really grew throughout the story, and Sophia has a lot of layers that I really, really hope get explored in the next books. I appreciated the fact that it wasnt love at first site between Nicholas and Etta. There was attraction, yes, but it wasnt until near the end when things got serious between them. And, jeez, they just make my heart hurt because theyre adorable together. They mention two traveler couples being love matches and how its rare and it makes me wonder  is it just rare for two travelers to fall in love in general or is there more to it? Is being a love match something deeper than just falling in love with someone? I cant decide if its just uncommon or if theres going to be more to them as a couple in the future. Ive never read anything by Bracken before, so I didnt know what to expect for the writing, but I loved it. Sometimes it was a bit flowery, but I think it worked for this. And  in my opinion, though Im no expert  I think she handled racism and sexism throughout the different eras very well by being so direct about both. Despite the fact that Im going to be miserable waiting for the next book for the next long, long year, Im so glad I read this because its now one of my favorites.
The story of Peter Pan never intrigued me as a child. I was always day dreaming about what I would be, see and do when I grew up; therefore the concept of living in a realm where you could forever remain a child was not appealing. It is only in adulthood, that I understand. But even still, the story of Peter Pan is not my favorite. I say this so that you understand my love of Tiger Lily was unexpected. I cant even put my finger on what prompted me to glance at Tiger Lily, but I was a goner within the first few pages. Told from Tinker Bells point of view, we are enabled to see a broad view of the underbelly of Neverland and the host of characters that reside within the magical realm. Tiger Lillys Neverland wasnt what I imagined it would be. Its dark, lonely and dangerous. The woods are only a place to romp and play within for those that are extraordinarily brave or oblivious. The residents themselves live with a constant undercurrent of fear whether it be of their fellow villagers, pirates, wild beasts, Englanders, or most fearsome of all, change. We are also shown the characters we all recognize, though new, colorful sides of them are presented. Captain Hook, for instance, is a drunken, desolate man, who no longer recognizes himself as he was when he was a young, eager man searching for eternal youth. On the other hand, Peter Pan, is everything we have known him to be, adventureous, impulsive, and charming. However, we also learn that his playful, seemingly spontaneous actions are driven from fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of growing up and the responsibility that coincides with adulthood. But the biggest treat of all is a character barely referenced in the tale of Peter Pan, Tiger Lily. Tiger Lily is a lonesome character with a fierce will and a deep sense of compassion that she carefully keeps hidden. Adopted at infancy by the village Shaman, she is taunted and teased mercilessly. Many believe she is cursed. Her story is not a happy one. Yet it is evident from the onset that Tiger Lily has a thirst for exploration, and eagerness to discover the world and her place within it. In spite of my knowing that Peter ultimately winds up with Wendy Darling, I couldnt help but feel the wrongness of such an ending as I became immersed in their story. The characters of Tiger Lily and Peter called to one another, each possessing characteristics the other lacked, delighting in all the traits that made them the same and failing in their ability to express either. Ultimately, it was the choices of each of these characters, and those closest to them that made this book both heartbreaking and joyful. Its truly a beautiful and surprisingly haunting tale.
2.5 I know that this book is a prequel to the Parasol Protectorate series, and I think that if I had read those first I might have enjoyed this one more. Etiquette and Espionage is the first steampunk novel I have ever read, and I dont want to judge the entire genre based on this book. Ill start by saying that neither the writing, nor the characters are awful. In fact, I enjoyed the first half of the book. However, somewhere along the line I just couldnt get into the rest of the novel. Maybe it was the wordiness, or the lack of an interesting plot. Im not sure what is was, but I really wanted to enjoy the book, so I pushed myself to finish, but sadly I didnt get much out of it. The novel takes place in Victorian Era England, with an alternative twist. There are robots, werewolves, and vampires just to name a few of the interesting changes to this England. Sophronia is a fourteen year old wild child and alternative world aside, this is still Victorian England, so her wildness must be tamed. Her mother sends her to Finishing school where she hopes she will be trained in the art of being a proper lady. The school promises to do just that along with teaching her how to be a proper assassin. This all sounded really cool to me. A school under the guise of teaching young ladies to be proper, but truly teaching them how to be deadly. It was also a plus that there was a boarding school involved. I love boarding school books. However, the school itself isnt a character the way I expected it to be. I dont mean in a Hogwarts type way because nothing compares to Hogwarts. However, I wanted to read about this school and think I want to go here, and I didnt. What I did like were the characters. Sophronia is a good friend, has a personality, and is smart. Her friends each have their little quirks which make them fun to read. I also enjoyed the humor and the wittiness of the women in the novel. As for the plot, it was very standard and predictable. I lost interest towards the end and only skimmed through the last fifty pages, so I honestly I cant say how the issues were resolved. I truly think the reason I didnt enjoy this one so much was the writing style. Not to say it wasnt written well. It just wasnt my preferred style. Again maybe if I was a fan of Gail Carriger s other books then this one would have been fun for me. Iam considering reading her other series, and if I enjoy those then perhaps come back to this one. Well see. Overall it wasnt my cup of tea, but if you like steampunk and the Victorian era then this might be for you.
Six teenage outcasts are forced to work together to pull off an impossible heist. The prize is untold wealth and freedom from the brutal realities of their present circumstances. Inej is the Wraith, a seventeenyearold who is already a legend to the gangs of Ketterdam. Jesper is a sharpshooter with a gambling problem and a dangerous secret. Wylan is new to the streets, trying to earn his place in the gangs. Nina is a Grisha, but being powerful is dangerous in a city that indentures magic users. Matthias is in prison, dreaming of escaping to enact his revenge. Kaz Brekker is the criminal mastermind or thug, or boy with a tortured past who will bring the six together to try for an impossible goal. Its been WAY too long since I took the time to post reviews, which I feel really guilty about, but my delinquency does provide me with an excellent example of just how much I liked Six of Crows: immediately after finishing it I am faced with an enormous need to share it with the rest of the world. This book boldly dives into multiple points of view, switching perspectives with each new chapter. Instead of feeling annoyed and confused by this, as is often the case hello, Game of Thrones, I found myself immersed in each of the six outcast teens, who all have complicated pasts and desperate futures. Of course I had favorites, but I was astonished by how thoroughly each of the point of view characters came to life. I still have Kazs dark, sarcastic voice stuck in my head, as a matter of fact. The other really lovely aspect to the multiple POV ploy is that the reader discovers how the characters see each other, not just how each character sees himherself. This is particularly fascinating in a story about a bunch of teenage criminals, who pretty much all have reasons to hate, fear, or love each other. Each of the viewpoints is another facet of the same storylinethe book doesnt split into six different plots, just presents the same impossible heist through layers that build up, one after another, into one fastpaced plot. I love the blend of cultures Bardugo weaves into her fantasy worldbuilding. The Grisha trilogy was obviously very Russianbased; this new series is set in a Dutch culture, though since the city of Ketterdam is a center of trade, the main characters are a hodgepodge of nationalities and races. As a librarian I love to see books that are so matteroffactly multicultural especially fantasy books!. As I believe Ive previously mentioned, I am also a huge fan of Bardugos poetic writing style. Shes intensely descriptive, but in a tight, gritty way that never slows down the action. I will say this is not a book to give to anyone who likes their fantasy light and fluffy. Obviously a book about a dock gang is going to get pretty violent. Some of the characters painful pasts involve mature content as well. With that warning note out there for those who dont care for any grittiness in their fantasy, I can honestly say that this is one of the best YA fantasy novels Ive read in a very long time.
I just finished this and I have big fat ugly tears still rolling down my face as I type this. Okay so first and foremost this is advertised as Labyrinth retelling. It is NOT. Other than yes there is a Goblin King. Yes it is somewhat difficult to get where he lives a Labyrinth really feels like a stretch. The characters is definitely David Bowie inspired in looks and there are some other subtle references like poisoned peaches but that is it. So if you read this throw out your Labyrinth expectations you will be happier in the end. The story is set in the 1770s in Bavaria, Germany. Yes you can get the date based on the references to the musical composers listed and includes many of the myths and legends of the area and era. The relationship that is developed between LieslElisabeth and the Goblin King is such an amazing slow burn. The ending is not at all what I expected and is everything. It makes the book. I was actually thinking I was gonna rate this 3 stars until the last 40 pages. There are many things that I did not like about this book. 1. The main character LieslElisabeths constant nagging and complaining of her plain looks. She is jealous of her sisters looks, her brothers musical talent and just doesnt feel that she measures up. Im okay with that being a theme, however this is drilled into us, over and over and I got tired of hearing her whine and complain rather than focusing on her positives. 2. I am not a musical inclined person at all. So much of story is told through music. I really struggled to grasp and understand what the story was trying to convey. Understanding music theory and flow and composition is such a strong theme throughout the book that because I dont know anything about the musical world that I was lost. Imagine reading a book in English and a large portion is in French and you dont speak French. I felt I missed many parts of their relationship despite the author trying to explain it. 3. The beginning is super slow. The first 100 pages or so are simply setting up and explaining the main characters love of music. Despite these things I was so involved with the characters love story. Its beautiful, and painful, and amazing! I very much look forward to the next book Shadowsong. Sneak Peek at ShadowSong: 
Actual rating 4.5 stars This is the first novel from Sarah J Mass that Ive read, and I have to say I was impressed. Not being a fan of fairytale retellings, but am finding this genre to continually grow on my bookshelf  A Court of Thorns and Roses, puts an original spin on the Beauty and the Beast fable. Outstanding story telling  although there are a few moments, one at the start and one near the end, that felt a little too convenient and were made to happen for the sake of the story line and to fit into the original fairy tale mold. Which is what ultimately knocked this down half a point for me; I guess because the writing and character development had so far exceeded my expectations that these contrived plot points were glaringly contrite. But that is the worst of my criticism. It has been years since Ive gotten lost in a fantasy world. Im usually reading contemporary, science fiction or supernatural. But Maas got me hook, line and sinker... Feyre is obstinate and challenging from the first page  and we really get to believe her assumptions, know that she is right. And then it slowly gets pulled apart like a slowly unraveling jumper. I loved her fierce independence and will to stand up on what she feels is right. Feyre is the type of character that spurns me to continue reading page to page  and thats without the action and intrigue of her story. Tamlin is a great beast. Scary, complex, intelligent and handsome. Most incarnations of beasts are superficially frightening, but Tamlin is righteously terrifying in all his glory. And, as the story goes when hes softened and tamed by Belle Feyre we get to see more of his beauty. Dont think hell become any less infamous though. The adventure has only just begun. Its obvious upon completion this is not a standalone, and I am very excited and eagerly awaiting the next installment. So, in the meantime, I will catch up to many of my bookish buddies and fill in time working my way through the Throne of Glass series. A Court of Thorns and Roses left me feeling a little shellshocked by the end. We really get put through the ringer. Its fast paced adventure makes the 400 pages a breeze and Maas beautific writing style pull you into a magical world and make reading effortless. Even though we all know the story of Beauty and the Beast, this story still manages to surprise. Definitely adding this to my favorites list and it is listed in my Top 5 Favorite reads of 2015. Highly recommended, even if you are not into fantasy, this will blow your mind.
OFFICIAL RELEASE TOMORROW. BUY IT HERE I received an ARC of this book in exchange for my own, honest review WOW! This book was amazing and completely exceeded all expectations I had for it! Im going to start off by saying, youve probably never read anything like this. A lot of times when I read books I feel jaded. Same plots make for boring stories. But this plot line wasnt similar to anything Ive read before and definitely NOT boring. Im also a huge sucker for change in view points, which this book had : But, I suck at describing plots because I feel always feel like Im spoiling, so just GO READ IT! I promise well I really really hope you wont regret it : In addition to the plot, I loved the characters. There were three main characters, Neve, Romer, and Dylan. Neve, the main character, is a smart neuroscience student, whos also an aspiring artist. What I really like about Neve apart from her unique name was that she was relatable. She didnt follow the typical female character mold we see in so many books these days. Even though Neve was heartbroken over her ex, Dylan, she handled it maturely. She was just a girl trying to find her place in life, just like most of us. The next character was Romer now would be a good time to mention that Im totally Team Romer. What I really like was that Romer was that he wasnt just there to be the other love interest. Romer was heavily involved in the story. Also his bad boy personality was a great plus : And finally, there was Dylan. I kept going back and forth between hating Dylan and loving him. Like the other characters, Dylan also played an important role in the novel and . Overall I liked how all the characters were smart and independent yet still had some flaws which made them more human : And last, but definitely not least, the writing. The writing was absolutely beautiful. It was sophisticated yet easy to understand. I know the author says she never thought shed become a writer but she was obviously destined to be one : All in all, I absolutely, positively LOVED this novel and I cant wait for the next book! One more thing: I NEED to get my hands on a physical copy of this book because the cover is so gorgeous which may I add the author DREW HERSELF! insert heart eyes
This is truly one of the most original and creative books that I have ever read. After reading the synopsis for this book, I was greatly excited. I can honestly say that I did not know what to expect going into this book. I didnt really have any expectations, other than I knew that the book would be good because of the familiarity with the authors. They write extraordinary books, and so I knew this one would fit the bill. What I didnt expect was for this book to leave such an imprint on me. The first thing that you will notice about this book is the format. This book is told in an unorthodox, yet fascinating way. Coming directly from the synopsis of the book, this story is told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documentsincluding emails, maps, files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more. You may be wondering how you can possibly comprehend a story that it told in such a manner, but Kaufman and Kristoff pull it off effortlessly. They tell a story that is so effective, that I wouldnt be surprised if books in this format start popping up like mad. Not only do you comprehend the story, but you fall right into it. This story will devour you whole. It is truly a visionary piece of art. After the initial shock of not reading a traditionally structured novel, you will start to connect with the characters. These characters are going through so much trauma that you can really feel what they are feeling. While reading you come to love them and root for them. The mystery and suspense in this book are freaking amazing! Just when you think you have things figured out, BOOM! Things get shaken up and you are left with your mouth hanging open while you race through the pages to find out what happens next. I just love the way that things played out. I was certainly not expecting all the twists and turns. Kaufman and Kristoff tell a story so magical that you will be swept up and carried away. I guarantee that once you start reading this you will not be able to put it down. Even if you are skeptic about reading this because it is outside of your comfort zone, READ IT ANYWAY! Seriously, I cannot stress enough the AWESOME that is this book. I am highly and agonizingly anticipating the second part of this story in Gemina! More reviews on my blog: The Alchemy of Ink
I had no real intentions of reading this book but after seeing so many rave reviews all over the blogosphere I had to pick it up. And let me just say this book was breathtakingly amazing. I cant believe that this is a debut novel, by far one of my favorite debuts this year. Even if you dont read much high fantasy I recommend you pick it up. Bardugo is seriously one hell of a writer, she created a world so magical and freaking brilliant all I remember is opening up Shadow and Bone and getting lost in a time filled with magic, royal courts, wars, and secrets along with betrayal, love, and characters you cant help but be captivated by. The book is centered around the Fold...the Unsea, a place which at least the way I perceived from the description is one very terrifying place. Rarely does anyone make it pass the Fold, its dark and there are creatures called the Volcra in there that will kill off anything that tries to make its way through. In comes Alina, she discovers a dormant power she didnt know she had and due to that discovery her entire life is changed. She becomes part of the magical elite, the Grisha which is something she never fathomed but neither did she also ever imagine being ripped away from her childhood friend Mal and living within the perimeters of the Darkling the most powerful and feared magical being of them all. I cant began to explain how much I loved the world Bardugo created, and the characters in them especially the Grisha they were the most interesting of the bunch. They had some pretty cool powers but I do admit it took me a minute to get all the details about them down since they all had different titles based on what they could do  Corporalki, Etherealki, Materialki and they also wore different color robes as well based on what their power was. The love triangle, I liked it. I didnt expect a love triangle going in and was surprised by it but it worked well with the story. Lets just say things are definitely not what they seem and even I didnt see the twists coming. And that is all I am giving away. The Darkling I have to talk about him, he is not evil exactly but he is not good either if that makes sense. There was something about his character that I just found myself anxiously waiting for him to appear within the pages of the book constantly. Now there is also Mal the childhood friend of Alinas, he took my breath away by the end of the book, at first I figured he was just that her friend someone who even though Alina clearly had feelings for was taking her for granted figuring she would always be there and at the same time growing apart from her but Mal surprised me ... and that is all Im saying about that. Incase you havent noticed I dont want to give too much away I feel any little extra detail can ruin the book. Last but not least Alina was an amazing character. She showed so much growth throughout the book. She went from being unsure and weak to really taking control, discovering who she is and becoming one very confident and powerful girl. Overall this book was incredible and I cant stress enough about how much you should pick this up.
I feel that The Infernal Devices trilogy really shows off how far Cassandra Clare has come as a writer since her debut City of Bones. Dont get me wrong Im a huge fan of The Mortal Instruments series but I feel that The Infernal Devices is so much stronger in characters, plot, and writing. Im a sucker for well written historical fiction at the best of times but historical fiction with shadowhunters and all the paranormal creatures you can think of? Yes please! I had a feeling after reading Clockwork Angel that I could possibly come to love this series even more than The Mortal Instruments and Clockwork Prince definitely tipped me over the edge. This has to be the most romantic of all of Cassandra Clares books to date, the majority of the book focusing on the complex relationships our leading lady Tessa has with shadowhunter parabatai brothers Jem and Will. Some huge plot twists get revealed about the boys in Clockwork Prince which literally changes everything for Tessa. Both Jem and Will have been through so much and in this book you get to see the extent of that and get to know the boys so much better. There are some very hot and steamy moments and I, like Tessa, spent much of the book totally convinced I loved kind hearted, silver fox, Jem only to look into Will Herondales blueviolet eyes and be undecided all over again. I love both boys so much and I almost dont want Tessa to have to choose either of them, not if it will end up hurting the other one. Basically Cassie Clare has created the most intense love triangle Ive ever read. I love it and I dont even usually like love triangles. What I love best about The Infernal Devices are the characters. I think Tessa is such a strong, smart and likeable heroine who I connect with way more than I ever have with Clary. Then there are my lovely I mean badass cough shadowhunter boys Will and Jem. But not only that the secondary characters stand out too and are so well developed. Clockwork Prince takes a step back from the Mortmain storyline and instead focuses on lots of sub plots that are all essential to the overall story. Each character has something going on with them and the book flicks back and forth between storylines so there is constantly something exciting going down. Clockwork Prince doesnt suffer from the dreaded middle book syndrome at all and instead reveals plenty of secrets and twists whilst creating new questions setting things up for an explosive final book. Clockwork Prince blends together romance and none stop action seamlessly, Cassie Clare showing other Young Adult authors how paranormal romance is done. As for the book itself I really liked this exclusive collectors edition as it includes a letter that Will writes in Clockwork Angel and a short story Burning Bright which goes into Jems feelings during Clockwork Angel when he first meets Tessa. I was really excited to read Wills letter but surprisingly found myself enjoying Jems short story more although both were fantastic and added a little something extra that fans will really appreciate. I think this book is my favourite out of all of Cassandras books so far and I absolutely cannot wait for Clockwork Princess, the final book in this series, for what promises to be a heart stopping finale.
NEW I filmed a video review as well!!  I want to start this review by saying that I asked the publisher Thomas Dunne for an Advanced Copy and they were nice enough to send it my way! This was just amazing! So this book is written by an unknown narrator who is telling us the story of a girl named Mia and her journey through assassin school, where she wants to learn so she can avenge the death of her family. The writing in this book is by far the best part. The first 11 or so pages were done in such a beautiful way that I was instantly hooked to this book. And the writing just continuously gets better. There are footnotes in this book and honestly at first I found them completely jarring. I would get so engrossed in the story but then I would have to jump to a footnote. But the thing I loved was that the footnotes involved little snippets about Mias character or world building that I absolutely adored. It helped make the story a lot easier to read, but it didnt clog it down with info dumping. The characters are fantastic as well. Mia is a character that I related to so well. She is easily relatable and has many qualities that people will see in themselves. Her wit, sarcasm, and humour were easy to read and made her a more enjoyable character to read about and her journey and character building was fantastic. As for the side characters, I loved them all. Tric was easily my favourite character but I loved everyone, even the villains. They are all such believable characters and seem very realistic to what you imagine real assassins to be like. And the plot. Wow the plot was good. I really loved the whole idea of a school for assassins and the way the school operated and just the entire aspect of the world building. I will admit, there is a section midway through the book that I found a bit slower to read, just because it was like daily life and wasnt always super engrossing, but it was still interesting to read and absolutely key to the story. The ending of the book though, thats where things went from really good to amazing. I did NOT expect anything that happened and I, on three separate occasions, actually yelled out WHAT when I was reading. There were 2 instances at the end of the book that will make the wait for book 2 so unbearable. Overall, just an amazing fantasy story that has a great plot, great character, and amazing writing. I recommend to all the lovers of fantasy because whats not to love. And really though, its assassins.. what could go wrong?!
Reread this book and it is even better. I changed the rating to 5 stars. The ending still manages to shock me.   I enjoyed this book much more than the previous book. The bone season felt a bit overwhelming with the informationdumps in the beginning, but I had no problems with The mime order. The details are spread throughout the story and instead of being lost, I felt wrapped inside this world and its characters. Matters of the heart are quite beyond me. Hearts are frivolous things, good for nothing but pickling.  Jaxon. This book is an exciting journey. Paige managed to escape from Sheol I with other fugitives, making them the mostwanted people in London. Scion is looking for them and to keep herself covered, Paige has to return to work for her old mime lord Jaxon. I like how Paige tried to standup for herself and the truth around the danger of the Rephraite. She wasnt ready to bow to Jaxon and I found it admirable. Her life becomes even more complicated when the Underlord and his gang are murdered; the battle for the new Underlord is about to begin. What I love about the plot is the complexity, but how is refrains from becoming too dense. The political intrigue behind the Underlord and the brutal fight at the ending were exactly what I needed. That scene made my heart pound and Samantha doesnt spare her characters, so I had some frightened moments there. The twist at the end made my mouth drop and I wish the next book was already there, because its going to be hard to wait. I liked how we got more details about voyants and what happened; how the Rephraite came into the world and gained power. I think Im going to have to reread The bone season, because like I said in the introduction, the worldbuilding overwhelmed me in the beginning. I felt there was a better balance in The mime order and I want to go back to explore it again. Paige was a very strong character. She is realistic and intelligent, although sometimes a bit rash in her decisions. I warmed up for her and felt more connected to her than in The bone season. I had the same with Warden and their scenes together were great. Their romance is on the background and that gives a perfect vibe in the story. There is a tension between them and you are ready for it to explode. The secondary characters are also fleshed out, like Jaxon and his obsession with becoming the new Underlord for power and money. There is only one thing left to say: I WANT MORE.
There is no better feeling in the world for a bookworm than to reunite with a cast of characters she calls family. I have officially been ruined by The Royals and I am irrevocably addicted to their story. If you are new to this series, the first three books follow Ella and Reeds allconsuming love story. When you start one of these books, the world around you disappears! Tarnished Crown is a wonderful gift that Erin Watt gave to their fans. Its a novella that you do not want to miss if you loved Gideon and Savannah in the first three installments. Fallen Heir follows Easton Royal and Hartley Wright. You will be absolutely mesmerized by their journey from the moment you meet them! Easton Royal is about to meet his match! Hartley Wright is a mystery. Shes playing hard to get and Easton Royal is always ready for a challenge. The last thing he expected was to find what he was not looking for. A connection so strong that turns his word upside down and makes him want more in life. When these Royals fall, they fall hard and they dont look back. Fallen Heir exceeded of all my expectations! Erin Watt delivered another unputdownable reading escape that left me gasping for air! If youre not a fan of major cliffhangers, you might want to wait to read this book. The next one is releasing in January 2018 and it will be EPIC!!! I can just feel it! Im getting chills just thinking about how Fallen Heir ended! My jaw dropped to the floor and I did not know what to do with myself. Easton and Hartley compliment each other perfectly. They are perfectly imperfect and they have created a bond that completely stole my heart. Hartley put her foot down when it came to Easton. I loved Eastons flirtatious ways and how she resisted him. She accepted his friendship and that is the best thing that happened in Eastons life. Hartley was like a comforting blanket in Eastons world where he was living in blissful denial. I loved the chemistry that they shared and their addictive banter. They both have much to learn about each other and they grew so much as characters as their story evolved. It was an absolute pleasure to reunite with the entire cast of characters and to meet new characters as well. I absolutely love this series and I am so blessed to be able to read the stories that Erin Watt creates. I highly recommend this series if youre looking for your next binge read series. These Royals will absolutely ruin you!!! The struggle is real when it comes to the days that separate me from reuniting with my Royals. Is it January yet? I give, Fallen Heir, by Erin Watt, 5 addictive, intense, mindblowing, sitting at the edge of your seat stars!
Sydney has always faded into the background behind her charismatic older brother Peyton. As Peytons behavior becomes more reckless, their parents keep bailing him out of trouble. Until Peyton hits someone while driving drunk and hes sent to jail. Sydneys left wondering why shes the only one who seems concerned about the victim instead of how Peyton is coping in prison. Sydney finds herself seeking the company of the Chatham family, who own a pizza parlor and are so different from her own family. And the son, Mac, seems to see her as Sydney, not as the sister of the guy in jail. This was my first Sarah Dessen book and I really enjoyed it. I liked the characters, the writing style, the premise. Now Im wondering why it took me so long to finally crack open one of her books. It was very character driven and I found myself emphasizing with a lot of the characters. It was a book I started and just didnt want to put down. Sydney was an amazing character. I could understand her frustration at being shoved in the background but not wanting to speak up, her need to follow the rules and be seen as someone completely different than her brother, her wanting a fresh start at a new school. I liked the contrast of how she was with the friends from her old school vs the friends shed made at her new school. She just felt like a very realistic girl going through a rough time, making understandable mistakes, getting annoyed and frustrated with strict parents even though shes never been in trouble, having a hard time finding anything to talk about with her brother. Everything about her felt real. There were so many great characters in this book. I loved the Chathams, they were so warm and accepting of Sydney even as they had their own difficulties. Eric, a band mate of Macs, was funny and had a huge ego but still somehow was endearing. Mac, Sydneys love interest, was amazing. They were really cute together and I loved their banter during their pizza delivery runs and the support they gave each other. I also like how the romance was light but it added so much to the plot in terms of being what Sydney needed. I enjoyed the premise of the book as well. It was interesting to see it told from the POV of the drunk drivers sister, as opposed to the drunk driver or the victim. Both their lives changed in huge ways but this way, we got to see the subtle ways Sydneys life changed due to her brothers actions. The whole family was affected and were trying to deal with things in their own ways, and they all had to come to terms with different issues before they could begin to heal. It was a really interesting journey to read. Final thoughts: This was my first Sarah Dessen novel but it wont be my last.
TAHEREH MAFI, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY EMOTIONS?! I have no words for how awesome I think you are for writing such a masterpiece. If I had thought Shatter Me was amazing, this just blew me to pieces! JUST. WOW. This book basically picked up where Shatter Me left off. Juliette is at Omega Point with Adam and she is struggling with her powers. Meanwhile, Adam is being tested for HIS powers and why he has the ability to touch Juliette. The truth behind Adams powers was definitely a huge WOW factor for me, but Im not giving anything away. I totally loved the whole rebellion thing against the Reestablishment. Of course, then a full out war begins with them and things get pretty chaotic. And then theres WARNER. At first when I heard about Team Warner, my reaction was, Warner? The perverted, evil low life? But after reading Destroy Me and now Unravel Me, I totally understand him now. Hes such an infuriating character! I mean, Juliette and Adams love is really heartbreaking and tragic in this book, but Juliette and Warner? HOLY SHIT, thats some intense drama going on there. There were some great scenes with both guys and it was an emotional roller coaster! I also loved how Warner opened right up to Juliette in this book and let himself become vulnerable to her. I have to admit though, in some parts of this book, my hand was itching to bitch slap Juliette if she existed. There were some moments when I absolutely loathed her! She was so overdramatic with the self pitying. And Kenji. OHGAWD. I freaking loved this kid! He was just so hilarious and lovable. He definitely had his moments and without him, this book would be full of tension. Yet, he was also serious at times with Juliette and I loved how he was straightforward, didnt bullshit anyone and told Juliette the brutal truth without softening it up for her. Plus, I completely agreed with him when he was yelling at her about not trying hard enough and all that. Tahereh Mafi is seriously one of my favorite authors ever. I just love her writing style and the way she can make her words sound so poetic. And that brings us to the ending. THE SUSPENSE. I just. I cant. So, if you dont mind, Tahereh Mafi, could you please hurry up and finish writing book 3?
If I could give this book a million stars, I would. Tarryn, I hope youll read this review because you are one of the best authors out there I have ever had the pleasure to read. One could only hope to aspire to have a gift with words the way you do. Thank you for writing this beautiful and gutwrenching series. Never ever stop writing, please : Putting the spoiler warning up just in case Honestly this review wont do this book justice but all I can do is try. I laughed, I cried a lot!, I wanted to punch certain characters, but most importantly of all, I felt. Doesnt everyone want a guy like Caleb? One who will push, pull and punch his way through just to fight for you? That pretty much sums up Caleb in this book. Olivia has actually softened up a lot in this book. Shes still dealing with those demons though. Caleb doesnt care. He just knows he wants her and wants them to be together forever. Not going to give anything away since I know people are still reading but all of our questions are answered: What WAS in the box? What did happen with that woman the night Caleb and Olivia were supposed to go away together? And there are lots more surprises and twists and turns. You think you finally have the answer to something, then Tarryn throws you a punch and you find out its not true at all. Shes a master at that. I really dont think anyone will be disappointed with this book. It was everything I could have hoped for and way more. QUOTES Olivia is a piece of art. You have to know how to interpret her, how to see the beauty under the harsh lines of her personality A perfect eyebrow arches up. God. I hate it when she does that. I want to spank her She has not cussed once since I stepped through their doorwhich is the longest her mouth has ever been clean in the history of Olivia Olivia Kapsen stepped into my life, and for the first time I was dedicated to something She was mouthy, condescending and she never smiled, but I liked her. I wanted to give her something. So I missed the shot Eventually...That word is so us, isnt it? Eventually, youll tell me youre faking your amnesia. Eventually, Ill tell you that Im pretending not to know you. Eventually, well come back together, fall apart, come back together What?... What snarky little comment are you going to make? Keep your mouth shut and lets go But you are valuable enough for any and every man in your life to drop everything to protect you Life does not accommodate you, it shatters you. Love is mean, but its good. It keeps us alive. If you need her, then wait Everything thats not you feels wrong, Duchess
I was intrigued by A Darker Shade of Magic, but it wasnt really on my radar for a book I had to pick up the second it came out. I recieved a brandspankingnew fresh copy in my Owlcrate and it peeked my interest even more. I havent read anything by Schwab before this, but figured if Owlcrate was choosing to feature this book in their first book, it must be something special. Likes: I am a huge advocate for worldbuilding. When a story is set in a newly created world, I want to be able to understand what the world looks like, how society operates and how the world really works. Schwab did an amazing job creating the Londons. There is a lot of detail given to the history of the worlds, along with creating multiple Londons and characters. Kell. He stuck with you from the beginning. The beginning of the story starts with Kells jacket and you are immediately intrigued. Kell wore a very peculiar coat. It had neither one side, which would be conventional, nor two, which would be unexpected, but several, which was, of course, impossible. The first thing he did whenever he stepped out of one London and into another was take off the coat and turn it inside out once or twice or even three times until he found the side he needed. Once I met Lila, I could not get enough of her. I wanted every chapter to feature Lila and when it was just Kell, I felt like I almost wanted to rush through to get to Lila. I am not sure why I loved her character so much, but she felt like a best friend that I could go on some crazy adventures with. The whole concept of magic or the lack of magic in the Londons was really unique. I felt like it was fresh, new fantasy and enjoyed that I couldnt predict the plot. Gripes: The only thing that really frustrated me, in the beginning of the book, was that there was no real plot. I was reading about this amazing world, traveling between the Londons, meeting new people and enjoying the characters, but I felt like I was reading a story with no purpose. It was about 100 pages in when we had a clear purpose and path. I needed that. I love the characters and the worldbuilding, but I feel like I am floundering when a story doesnt have a direction. Victoria wrote this post on Twitter. As much as I agree with her, I did realize that plot was important to me. It didnt really matter what the plot in the story exactly was, but I just needed a purpose For more reviews visit A Flurry of Ponderings
Of Poseidon was another one of my most anticipated novels of 2012, and again, it was another disappointed. The cover and the synopsis totally got me excited for Of Poseidon, and the fact that it was my first mermaid novel added to that excitement. Now, I thought I would change things up with the review and basically list in pointer form what I didnt like about it: 1. Insta Love: Should I say more? If there were rallies and opposition groups for instalove I would be one of the first people to sign up. No matter what genre the book Im reading is, whether paranormal, dystopian, or fantasy, and no matter how out of the world the plot is, I STILL want a realistic love story. Instalove is the most unrealistic love plot in the history of love plots. Best friends fall in love? Yes, girl gets the bad boy and reforms him? Yes, smitten at first sight? Yes, desperate, world shaking love at first sight? NO. I really hated how the two leads, Emma and Galen somehow became head over heels in love with barely any verbal communication happening! Im sorry, I cant get over that. 2. Adding many cliched secondary characters: so, one supposedly important character in the novel gets KILLED in the second chapter. Not only was the character portrayed as important to the protagonist, the character was MEAN and just straight out rude to the protagonist. So I really felt no sympathy and no connection to the small grieving period Emma went through. Another two characters fell in the line of Girl hates guy, guy chases after her, the minute the guy turns his attention to another girl, the girl realizes she LOVES HIM REALLY? I feel like this wasnt played well, all secondary plots were too shallow for me to invest or care enough on what happens, and the girl was a diva and the guy was just desperate, which is why I just didnt care. 3. Forced plot: A couple of days ago I wrote a review about how the close proximity between the protagonist and her love interest was not forced, and I really dont like how some novels force the characters together. Well, this happened in Of Poseidon. Emmas mother thinks Emma is dating Galen so they go along with it, oh and to make it more believable they have to make out whenever they are in public! Why cant authors think of original noncliched plots to allow their characters to spend time together? And no, accidently sleeping at his house more than once is NOT one of them! Now, there is one thing I liked about this novel, and it is the ending, the last 30 pages were definitely fast paced and the ending was SO unexpected and I have to give props to the great cliffhanger. However, that really is the only thing I liked about this book, and reading it was a very slow process that took around a week, and that is way too many days for a measly 300 page novel.
I got sent this book as part of a book exchange and Im so glad I got it because it was an excellent and thought provoking read. Being Mortal is a look at aging and death from the perspective of a doctor. Atul Gawande weaves studies and facts in between the stories of his patients and at the end, the story of his father. There are several topics but I think they can be grouped into two categories: 1. How should we, as a society, handle the problem of aging? Nursing homes tend not to make their residents happy, because of the lack of autonomy and independence. But the people who chose the nursing homes tend to be the kids, who consider the question do I feel okay leaving my parent here? more than the question will my parent feel happy here? The book looks at nursing homes today and explores several alternatives, also while talking about the effects of aging. 2. How far should doctors go when trying to save a life? Medicine tends to focus on the promise of time even if its just a little more time, which may come at the expense of quality of life. But how do doctors know what balance to strike? This requires talking to the patient and understanding their needs and wants. Ask them things like how much painhow far will you accept a deteriorating quality of life in order to get some extra time? And the answer will differ from person to person. One guy said as long as I can eat chocolate icecream and watch sports on TV. Atul Gawandes father needed more, and so his ideal treatment plan would be very different from the previous guy. The idea is that by understanding what the patient means by good life, the doctors and the family making medical decisions know how far they can go. This is, obviously, a difficult conversation to have with anyone. But it is a necessary conversation to have because the patients point of view and their familys will differ. One study mentioned showed that perspective matters  if you feel the end is near, you focus more on your immediate relationships and environment. On the other hand, if you feel youve got time, youll be more willing to delay gratification for a payoff in the future. Being Mortal deals with a very uncomfortable subject, but it is a book that everyone should read. Even if we assume that old age is far away, an accident or illness may strike at any time, because death makes no distinction between the old and the young. If you like podcasts, you may want to listen to Atul Gawandes Reith Lectures, and Episode 101 Title: Minka of Reply All, which deals with the topic of nursing homes.

From Innocent Smileys Reviews I just finished Cinder five minutes ago, and I am speechless. Im at a loss of words. Really, anything said in this review cannot express how amazing and wonderful this book is. My review does no justice. Im literally going to be walking around like a limp noodle for the next few days, in a daze over THIS BOOK. This gif totally fits bwahaha But honestly, where do I begin. Obviously with forcing everyone who hasnt read Cinder to go read it now. Cinder is the story of a cyborg mechanic in a far off future where the letumosis plague is eating everyone away. Stuck with her evil stepmother and her two daughters Pearl and Peony, she manages to survive by supporting them her genius mechanical skills. Everything changes when Peony catches the illness, and Cinder is sent away for the voluntary cyborg draft, where she will be tested on to find a cure. And everyone knows no cyborg comes back from those tests. No one except for Cinder, because shes the only hope for Earth when it comes to the Lunar race, and more importantly the Lunar Queen. The moment I met Cinder, I instantly loved her, and her sarcasm. After reading so many YA books with mediocre heroines, Cinder blew me away. I really cant describe it right at the moment, nor am I emotionally capable of writing this review at the moment, but Cinder is a smart, kickass MC, who makes smart, and reasonable, decisions that arent questioned by the reader. Plus shes a cyborg, which I know is looked down upon in the book, but I personally think thats awesome. All of the minor characters were mostly or fully developed. The reason I know this? Because I fell in love with every one of them, even Adri and the Lunar Queen I dont actually love them, just the characters themselves.....blagh its hard to explain, hopefully you know what I mean? What Im trying to say is that they were done well. Iko and Peony were definitely my favorites. And PRINCE KAI! Oh I have mixed feelings about you! Especially at the end there. But I leave further judgements to the next book. This is one of the best worldbuilding I have ever read about in a YA novel. Its absolutely stunning. Everything about New Beijing is well put together. Theres no info dump, everything is gradually put on you. The context of the story gives you accurate descriptions of the environment and the new tech, like androids, hovers, IDs, etc. If an author had to learn one thing from Meyer, its that you dont just tell us what this or that is, you show show show SHOW. I am in love with this fantasy, science fiction, dystopian mix of a genre. ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE, and I really cannot contain my inner fangirlness! Im dying to read the next book. I want more! I read half of the book in one sitting and the rest just now, and I seriously need the rest of the series. Someone send me Scarlet now please!
5 stars!!!! So yeah, Colleen Hoover did it again. I fell in love with this book, and I fell in love with the amazing Ridge. Im amazed by the ability she has to create these incredible male characters in all of her stories. Really, she never disappoints. Every one of them has something unique and special that makes everything even more fantastic. In this case, Ridge is a pretty great human being. I loved every single page because of him, basically. I liked Sidney, but my favorite part of Maybe Someday was definitely Ridge. I have to congratulate Colleen Hoover and thank her for making me feel so much. I dont want to tell too much about it, just in case I give an spoiler, and this book is worth so much, I dont want to ruin it for anyone. The characters are so well developed, each one had their particular something, and it completed the story in a really good way. While you read, you can feel a lot of things, this author writes very passionate and emotional scenes, and that makes you get into the story even more deeply. I had my notebook full of fantastic quotes from this book. I wished Colleen wrote a few more steamy moments, because thats something she does so good as well my favorite book from her so far is Ugly Love, but after all, the story speaks for itself without all the smut. Its enough to make you hot and emotional at the same time. Like I said, I cant tell too much without giving everything away, but I have to say that nearly at the end of the story I was kinda uncomfortable with the way things were happening, but Im glad it ended like it did. At some point it was feeling kinda forced to me, but then it was fixed and made sense again. I love how artistic this author is, not only her, but her characters, and I wish we could know more about Sidneys major and classes. Warren was one of my favorite characters as well, but only because of the things he does at the end. And I hurt with Sidney at some point when nobody seemed to think about her feelings and empathize with her, because she was a victim too and the rest seemed to forget it and think she wasnt hurting and going through a lot of pain as well... that was something that annoyed me too, and thats also the reason why Im going to forget the fact that she couldnt stop crying at the end, and thats something I really hate about a character. Another recommendation for everyone who loves Colleen Hoover, and special and emotional stories with something different and original.
One of the most important books I have ever read. With eloquence, passion, and careful research, Michelle Alexander shows how slavery in the United States has not disappeared  it has just changed shape, into the mass incarceration of black men. Among many formidable arguments, Alexander emphasizes the importance of doing away with the notion of colorblindness and how we need to see race more than ever. A quote that highlights her point: In the era of colorblindness, it is no longer socially permissible to use race, explicitly, as a justification for discrimination, exclusion, and social contempt. So we dont. Rather than rely on race, we use our criminal justice system to label people of color criminals and then engage in all the practices we supposedly left behind. Today it is perfectly legal to discriminate against criminals in nearly all the ways that it was once legal to discriminate against African Americans. Once youre labeled a felon, the old forms of discriminationemployment discrimination, housing discrimination, denial of the right to vote, denial of educational opportunity, denial of food stamps and other public benefits, and exclusion from jury serviceare suddenly legal. As a criminal, you have scarcely more rights, and arguably less respect, than a black man living in Alabama at the height of Jim Crow. We have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it. Overall, I recommend this book to everyone. You really should read this now. Alexander does a remarkable job of revealing uncomfortable truths about the United States  mainly, that racism is well and alive  while urging us to take action, to treat each other with compassion, and to recognize that true compassion involves taking action against institutionalized forms of oppression like mass incarceration. In other words: donate to the ACLU, go out and join protests, and say that black lives matter without an ounce of hesitation. I know I have a lot of work to do  and I hope we can all fight together. I will end this brief review with some of Alexanders words, because she says everything way better than I can: Seeing race is not the problem. Refusing to care for the people we see is the problem. The fact that the meaning of race may evolve over time or lose much of its significance is hardly a reason to be struck blind. We should hope not for a colorblind society but instead for a world in which we can see each other fully, learn from each other, and do what we can to respond to each other with love. That was Kings dream  a society that is capable of seeing each of us, as we are, with love. That is a goal worth fighting for.
I loved this book. Ive read most of Kristen Ashleys books. I have my favorites in each of her series, this is my favorite Chaos book, so far. Her books can be a bit formulaic, and predictable, but what she does better than most authors, is character development. She writes characters that are real. People you would want to know, hang out with, and people you know would always be there for you, always have your back. Carson Joker Steele and Carissa Teodoro went to the same high school. And thats about all they have in common. Hes the dark, menacing loner, shes the honey blonde cheerleader dating the most popular boy in school. Carson always wanted her, but knew he was never going to be good enough for her. Carissa knew there was more to Carson than he showed, she knew he was kind, smart, and an amazing artist. But she was in love with her high school sweetheart, her life was all planned out. She was going to marry, have lots of babies and be happy. Shortly before his eighteenth birthday, Carson has had enough of living with his abusive father and takes off. Seven years later, he has put Carson Steele away, and has become Joker. He found a life hes comfortable in and a family in his motorcycle club. Doing a good deed, he stops to help a young woman and her child broken down on the side of the highway. And is completely shocked when he realizes who the woman driving the rolling wreck is. Carissa. But she doesnt recognize him. And its obvious her life has not turned out as she envisioned it. Shes divorced, struggling to make ends meet and has an eight month old son. And a ex husband who enjoys tormenting and threatening her. Joker sets things in motion to help her and her son out, all the while keeping his distance from her. And as scary as he appears, Carissa is grateful for his help, and wants to get to know him. And in typical KA fashion, the more they fight their attraction for each other, the closer they become. This was such a great story. I loved watching Joker and Carissa get to know each other, and watch their feelings deepen for each other. There are some tense moments with the MC as they continue to fight the war to keep drugs and prostitution away from their territory. Joker being healed enough to reconnect with the few positive role models he had growing up, especially the side story with his teacher, was heart warming. And the laughs were there as always. There were also lots of characters from other series showing up, some of the hot bunch and their rock chicks, all of the Dream Men and their women, and even Knight, from the Unfinished Hero series shows up late in the book. It was like a family reunion. I loved it.
The next instalment of The 5th Wave does not disappoint. After a riveting opening chapter, the first book was only the beginning. The Others have much darker plans ahead for the rest of mankind. Firstly, I was delighted by the larger narration from Ringers point of view, shes one of my favourite characters, ever. At some parts of The Infinite Sea, and from the first book too, I felt as if Yancey doesnt quite write female characters as well as the male ones  Cassie felt far more underdeveloped compared to Zombie, for instance, but Yancey was brilliant when it came to Ringer and Im glad that her character only gets more interesting. Then again, while Cassie only mildly irritated me in the first book, in this one she made want me want to tear my hair out. Honestly, its the end of the world, and all Cassie can do is get jealous over her alien boyfriend? Her naive actions make me question how she survived for so long. I wish that the entire book was written from Ringers point of view because she was by far the most interesting narrative. This book has plenty more action, suspense and twists than the first instalment, which is saying a lot. The Infinite Sea drowns the reader in fresh twists and dangers, and finally lets the characters intensively question the motives of the Others. The characters finally wonder why the Others resorted to using the waves to destroy the world, and why they left a portion of humans behind. If they have the ability to destroy 910 of the planet with a single virus, why not just eliminate them all? I like how developed the Others really get in this book, which is an issue I usually have with similar types of books where little is actually known about the motives and lives of the attacking force. Then theres Yanceys writing style, which for me was the difference between a four and a five star rating. The Infinite Sea definitely captures the intensity of such an epic plot. There are parts that are cringey typically from Cassie and her spoilt attitude and times where Im imagining the dialogue on the screen, feeling the intense weight of such actions and decisions. There are some beautiful lines in this book, as well as the first one. I only wish that they were more consistently woven throughout the novel, and that Yancey didnt keep describing characters by their bright or feverish eyes. I cannot fail to mention the sheer brilliance of Vosch. He was certainly enjoyable in the first book, but in The Infinite Wave, he advanced from being the shady badguy to a leader that sits down and plays chess while subliminally discussing his species decision to destroy humans. I wont spoil the ending, but be assured that Vosch certainly makes it as mindblowing as the rest. Most important of all, I loved this book because it made me think alongside the characters. It made me think about what the Others really are planning to do and how each character fits into the grand plan. I cant wait to get my hands on the final book in the trilogy! Im so glad that this book was just as good as the first.
 5 brilliant stars  Given that this was a story about Ty and Zane there was never any doubt, I was always going to love it! This book is a wonderful combination of fastpaced action and emotional drama. It really takes things up a notch from the previous books with real edge of your seat excitement and true emotional turmoil. Tys revelations were shattering and it was heartbreaking to watch both Ty and Zane deal with the fallout. Abi really allows us to see the pain both men are experiencing. I also love the way she allows these two tough men to express their true feelings to one another......You told me one time that ...I was your compass. I gave you direction when you were lost, Ty said, nearly choking on the words. He glanced up, eyes reflecting like liquid in the low light. Well, you were my anchor. You were something solid for me to hold onto. I wanted you to remember that. The book seemed to provide so much insight, particularly into Tys past, but still left so many questions unanswered. The ending was so bittersweet It was the first purely honest kiss theyd ever shared. And it was a kiss goodbye. it is devastating to realise we need to wait nearly 12 months for the next instalment of this compelling story. Favourite quotes.... Zane forced his eyes open and found Tys as he surrendered all control to him. He trusted him, despite everything, despite trying to convince himself he couldnt. He trusted Ty with his body. He always had. He trusted Ty with his heart. It was his very soul that Ty had the power to break. .......... I just need to be able to trust you, Ty, he whispered. You can. I swear you can. Id die for you, Zane. Zanes heart was in his throat as he studied Tys profile. I know. .......... Youre a good man, Zane said, vehement as he jerked his head up. Youre a brave man. And youre a man who loves with his whole heart and soul. Thats who you are. .......... Zane grabbed a handful of Tys hair and tugged, and when Tys head tipped back, Zane kissed him hungrily, not letting go of him. Tys laugh turned into a growl, and suddenly there was no space between them. No tears or lonely days, no secrets and no lies. Just Ty and Zane. On the floor of their row house. On a crooked rug. .......... Who are you, Ty? Ty smiled against his cheek. I was an assassin, he whispered. Im a Marine. Im that man who doesnt miss. And Im yours. Zane bit his lip on a smile. Who are you, Zane? Zane cocked his head. Im an artist. Im a geek. He felt Ty smile. I am one badass motherfucker on a motorcycle. Ty began to laugh. Zane dipped his head until they were staring into each others eyes. And Im yours. From the Calendar shoot...... Ty and Zane video....One and Only...
The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true. Well Inej, my heart is currently pointing directly at Six of Crows. Hey, friend. Do you like diverse characters? Do you like to read about characters with disabilities? Characters from different lands, with different CULTURES  characters with different languages, religions? Do you like to see that in your fantasy books? How about equally strong male and female leads? With flaws, ambitions, and fears? You bet you do. Well Six of Crows has you covered. Now, I dont really remember how I stumbled upon this book. I think it was in the wake of my last reading disappointment, which resulted in me desperately seeking a pickmeup. This turned out to be so much more than that. Because this book is smart. It is so goddamn smart, so well put together. I think I was a little in love with this story from the moment I read the premise. A loveable band of outcasts, an impossible mission. These are the things that fuel me. We learn about our band of misfits in several ways. Both through the way they are developed in the story, and through flashback scenes which are expertly interwoven into the main arc. Yeah, DELICIOUS right? Leigh Bardugo introduces memories, past experiences, little glimpses into their backgrounds, which ripple through the book but never interrupt the main thread. Just thinking about that has me drooling over my keyboard a little. The characterisation is superb. They are all so compelling, so unique and imperfect and wonderful. Just, utterly human and believable. Then theres the romance! Yes, there is romance. But dont worry, it is good romance, it is great frigging romance guys. Real feelings, REAL HUMAN EMOTION. Because love is not easy, falling into love has it challenges. Who would have thought? And I want that, I want to read about challenging love! The personalities of these characters was not in ANY WAY sacrified for the sake of a hook up! They have a past, they have flaws! Thank you Leigh Bardugo, thank you so so much for writing about human emotion in this way. Thank you for not letting romance and pairings overwhelm your story telling. This was so perfectly done, I am so happy about it. What else did I love? Oh yes. The Grisha. I havent read the Grisha trilogy so, this was my first introduction, and I LOVE it. I love it. Such a good balanced way of writing magical elements. It felt very real and it was utterly fascinating. I will simply have to read more about the Grisha. Was there anything I disliked? No. Not really. Perhaps some elements felt a bit cliche some of the twists and turns I felt were a little too easily sign posted. But others knocked me off my feet. And I really dont have a single bad word to say about this book. holds a lighter aloft NO MOURNERS. NO FUNERALS.
5 stars!  Some adventures require nothing more than a willing heart and the ability to trip over the cracks in the world. Down Among the Sticks and Bones is a delightfully creepy novella. The beautiful writing gives the story an eerie and haunting atmosphere, the twists and turns tug at readers heartstrings, and the complex characters and incredible setting make this a fascinating novel. There is blood, death, love, hate, more blood, and two sisters trying to figure themselves out and their place in the world. Seanan McGuire deserves all the praise! The writing in this is absolutely stunning and sweeps readers off their feet and into the dangerous world of the Moors. The plot is engrossing, even in its horribleness, and grasps your attention right away. The novel also has a really important message, delivered in an enchanting way: let others decide who they want to be in this world. I have no word for how much I love this entire series. It hits all the right spots for me: welldeveloped and creepy as hell worldbuilding, eerie magic, odd places, layered characters, diversity, and beautiful writing. This installment has all of that and more, and it is a fantastic read. The novella is told in multiple POVs, all done expertly well. They flow rather smoothly and all POVs sound unique, giving us insight into who and how our main characters are: Jack and Jill. Despite being twins, Jack and Jill couldnt be more different from one another. The discussion about gender roles and gender stereotypes throughout the story is so well developed and hits all the right spots. Its also so much fun reading about the twins adventure as they grow into who they are meant to be. My only complaint is that this too short! I could easily read 200 more pages of Jack and Jill going up the hill. This is a treat for everyone who loves their characters and the previous installment, Every Heart A Doorway. Down Among the Sticks and Bones is a great read for Dark Fantasy fans! It does not shy away from horror and gore, while still reading like an eerie fairy tale. It has fantastic characters, a steady pace, marvelous writing, and a little sprinkle of romance. Recommend it to everyone who loves creepiness and fantasy!  Series: 2 in the Wayward Children series. POV: Told mainly from Jack and Jills POVs. Content Warnings: Murder. Gore. Cliffhanger: No. HEA: Not... really. Up Next: Beneath the Sugar Sky
Actual Rating: 412 stars. I rounded it up because I enjoyed the plot in this book more than Cinder. This is a very good series! What I loved about this book were the new characters, and the return of a beloved character from Cinder. Thorne was a hoot. Hes so charming and funny! Scarlet is a pretty strong chick and I like her temper. And Wolf....oh, what can I say about him? Hes so lovable and quirky and strong and violent and weird. Good and bad weird Ill get back to him, I have A LOT more to say about him. What I also loved about this book were the twists. They were immediately better than the twists in Cinder. In Cinder, I saw them coming a mile away, but in Scarlet, I was surprised and didnt see what was coming until it happened. Now, wah wah, the not so enjoyable. Though I understand why Kai didnt have a HUGE part in this book, the parts we did get from him were a bit lacking, in my opinion. I feel horrible that he has SO much on his shoulders right now, which is why it may feel like hes lost his spark from Cinder. Instead of being charming, sweet, trying to get Cinder to the ball Kai, hes a young emperor, in charge of hunting down a fugitive and dealing with a horrendous crisis. Oh, and trying to prevent a war. The chapters we get from his POV are all in his office, and are of him just trying to deal with this mess. Nooooooooo, hes marrying Queen Levana, NOOOOOO! Its just a temporary solution, Kai! You fool! You selfless, courageous fool. Also, I have a slight issue with Scarlet and Wolf. Yes, I will admit, I was a bit swoony and breathless over Wolf in the beginning but by the end... I dont know if I can trust him. We all knew there was something off about him, but I was SHOCKED by the revelation that hes one of Levanas Lunar creatures! I feel like after all the lies, the ONLY thing we know about him is that he wants to protect Scarlet. I dont know how Scarlet is going to trust him 100, so soon. At that point, if I was her, Id be like lets just be friends...Even though I loved the part about her being his Alpha Female. I dont know. I like them together but not love... And I believe his loyalties to our friends are true, but still... I dont know. Im confused! Troubles aside, I really enjoyed this book. Im really enjoying this series! I have Cress, and Im looking forward to reading it soon.
I am now, and forever, claiming Jamie as MINE!! Did you hear that? HE. IS. MINE. I love him and I know that he loves me too. Ok. Now that weve cleared that up, I loved this book. Hit The Spot had me hook line and surf board from the very first page to the last. Everything from the dirty talk to the sweet talk had me swooning and I was a complete mess by the time it was over. I begged for every kiss like it was a spice cake cupcake with cream cheese frosting my favorite, btw as I fell harder and harder with every turn of the page. I watched with anxious anticipation as Jamie and Tori waded through the rough waters of a new relationship. I willed my emotions to to stay in check when the excitement of the what was to come became too much. Basically, I devoured the perfection that is Hit The Spot. This book was a delectable mix of sexy and sweet. I felt invested in these characters and spent a good bit of my time reading with knots in my stomach. I just KNEW they were destined for a HEA and I wanted so badly to show them the way. I loved Jamie when he was tossing innuendos and dirty talk. I loved him when he was funny. But when he turned on the charm and the sweet talk I was a complete goner!! His patience and devotion to Tori left me in a puddle and may have possible made him my favorite J Daniels hero to date. Tori is this damaged girl that doesnt trust easily and overthinks everything. Shes sassy and independent. On the rare occasion that she let down her walls, you get to see this side of her thats loving and kind. There were times when I found myself frustrated with her but I understood her hesitation to trust. There were times when I wanted to throttle her but I convinced myself that she just needed more time. In the end I liked her. I devoured this book! It was addictive and full of moments that melted my heart and made me wish for more. I simply couldnt put it down. For me, it was everything perfect romance should be. I laughed and smiled all the way through. This may be J Daniels best yet!!  Kimberly Anne
Winter is the princess of Luna and shes also batshit crazy. I want to say its all due to the fact that she stepmother is Queen Levana but its also because she has withheld her ability control people and its taking a toll on her. Going into this story, I wasnt sure how I was going to love her character. In the last book, she certainly seemed more crazy but something happens when Jacin and Winter are together. She almost calms down a bit and I was surprised by Jacins tenderness with her. It was a side wed never seen from him before. Their romance was one of my favorite parts of the book. However, once the action really started rolling, I felt like Jacin and Winter were pushed to the background a little bit. I was also hoping for something bigger for them at the very end. The end has come but Im actually happy about it. This series was more than a rollercoaster ride for me. There were more than just crazy highs and lows, but also plenty of backtracking as well. That was one of my pet peeves with the last book but I think I came in with the right kind of mindset with this one. I knew that Meyer wouldnt go the easy or the most efficient route and that she would like take several steps back once any of the characters made their move. I feel like once youve seen it before, its easy to get immune to it so having the several setbacks didnt bother me as much in this one. However, it didnt stop me from rewriting certain scenes in my head to make it flow a little better. I just cant seem to help it. The resolution, when it came, worked but I also thought that there would be a greater sense of satisfaction. I got the Thorne moment I was waiting for, the moment when he would realize that Cress was too good for him but that he wanted her anyways. I really enjoyed that scene but as for the Cinder and Kai and Jacin and Winter, I was expecting a little bit more. Especially after what Cinder and Kai have gone through. I also would have loved to seen more with Kinney and Iko. There were some sparks there and I think that would make for a lovely story if Meyer decided to write something extra for them. Nevertheless, WINTER was a terrific read that kept me entranced. These characters are so magnetic that you cant help but love them. I have my favorites but choosing between them is hard. Its been a long time since I cared about a group of characters as much as I do with this one and I have no doubt that Ill be remembering them for years to come. The Lunar Chronicles is definitely my favorite series this year. Favorite Quote: Despite everything, she still looked like perfection, at least to him.
This review also appears on my blog, Reading with Jenna. Im not really sure what to say about Shatter Me. Ive been looking forward to reading it because Im probably the only person at this point who hasnt picked up this trilogy... and the male love interests sounded really interesting. But after reading this first installment, Im feeling a little bit let down. My main issue with Shatter Me is that I felt like there was no plot. The story for me didnt begin until 30 pages from the end of the book and I felt like the first 300 pages were just 300 pages of nothing. I couldnt even tell you what happened because I feel like nothing did. This book follows Juliette, a girl who has a fatal touch. Shes been imprisoned for over 250 days in a dark cell but one day shes brought out of her cell in order to aid The Reestablishment in their mission... something which Juliette doesnt want to do. But even though the novel had a really great concept, I dont think it was executed to its full potential. Juliette spends most of the book either locked up in different locations like a prisoner or on the run from different people who are after her. The plot doesnt really progress and by the end of the book I felt like I was still kind of at the beginning. What this book does focus on are the relationships between the characters and the romance. But I wasnt a fan of the romance in this book, nor the developing love triangle. Even though Adam seems like a great guy, I never really warmed to him and was always suspicious of him. I felt like the romance developed slightly too quickly and it was just a bit uncomfortable for me to read. Warner was an intriguing character to me but I also felt like he was a bit of a creep. Overall, none of the characters really did it for me. I did like the world in the book. The novel has an apocalyptic setting that I found really interesting. It was interesting to read about how the weather and ecosystems are failing due to human activities, and how the people live with barely any food and are concentrated in small communities that are governed by soldiers and The Reestablishment. What I was a little bit underwhelmed by was The Reestablishment itself. I thought the book lacked description and I didnt think The Reestablishment was very well conceptualised. I had a rough idea of who they were and what they did but I thought the world building in this respect was weak. Having said that, I enjoyed the writing style. It was easy to read and I sped through the book in two sittings. It made me want to keep reading and Ill definitely be picking up the rest of the trilogy. Hopefully the next two books address some of the plot and world building issues that I had.
It was different, but I liked it. I loved Godric and his band of rogues. They may not have been conventional, but they were a family who protected their own...even one they forced into it. I look forward to more in this series.  Wicked Designs is a historical romance with elements of suspense. Emily Parr has recently been orphaned. Her uncle, Albert Parr, has charge of her and access to the money left to her by her parents. Unfortunately, Uncle Albert does not make good investments and has found himself heavily in debt to several people. He bargains away one of his debtors, Thomas Blankenship, with the promise of Emilys hand in marriage. Emily has been subjected to Blankenships pawing and is unaware of her uncles deal with the devil. She is determined to make a good match to get away from her uncle and live life on her own terms. Emilys plans to snag a generous husband are thwarted when she is abducted by the League of Rogues. Godric St. Laurent, Duke of Essex is also owed money by Albert Parr. He has decided to ruin Emily as a way to retaliate against her uncle. However, Emily is not your average wilting flower. She is courageous, smart, and resourceful. I fell in love with her character. The author writes so eloquently about her from her grief over the loss of her parents to her hopes to win Godrics heart. I immediately empathized with her and admired her determination to be the captain of her own destiny. Her escape attempts were hilarious. I rode the fence on Godrics character. There were times where I liked him, but I couldnt understand how he could ruin Emilys life for his own sense of satisfaction. I did grow to really like him and by the end of the book I was firmly in his corner. I think I turned the corner when he chased her down and brought her back to his home. The author revealed his story layer by layer and included dialogue that revealed his selftalk. I absolutely love it when authors let you peep in and see what the male characters are thinking. I wish I could do that in real life. The secondary cast of characters added depth to the story. I loved all the rogues, and I am hopeful that this is the first book in a series. There were various hints at the stories of the other rogues and possible romances, but I would like to see each one find love. You could feel their camaraderie and genuine affection for each other. This story was the best of romance, friendship, and love. It was a quick, easy read that put a smile on my face. Reviewed by Michelle for Cocktails and Books
You dont need to be gifted with a blade. You are your own best weapon. It all began with a curse, which led to a crime and will resolve with a kiss. The highly anticipated finale to the epic Winners trilogy have arrived! The author does not disappoint as she continues to take readers through a tale of the star crossed lovers, whom have found themselves amidst a war. I really did not have much expectations coming into this book beside Kestrel and Arin as an end game. Indeed it was; yet it was so much more that it blew me away with how the authors ability to spin this story. Intricate fighting scenes marked the Winners Kiss more action packed compared to the previous books. Mores at stake. True to its title, theres kissing; actually a lot of kissing. Warning you would be overwhelm with the love between Kestrel and Arin that your heart might explode. The inner fangirl inside of me jumped for joy. I have been waiting for this since my heart got broken in the Winners Crime. Their relationship turned a new leaf, especially with a psychological transformation of Kestrel. I dont want to reveal much, but it worked out well. Trust placed a strain on their love before, but now it disappeared. In its place were cute comical bickering and bantering that simply made the inner fangirl in me very giddy. Arin redeemed himself in the last book. A new side of him that charmed the heck out of me. No longer do readers get the cold hearted jerk, whom should be forgotten. In his place, a softer side of him, whom emotions. Kestrel continues to be a total badass as always. Aside from the romantic relationships, the author farther developed relations between Kestrel and her father, General Trajan. Readers do not have the fondest memories of this coldhearted father. He might be an elite general, but obviously lacking in the world greatest father department. The author skillfully weaved in how strain these two are with each other. She does not disregard the important of family even in a state of war. The Winners trilogy became one of my favorite book series with the Winners Kiss being my favorite book. Highly recommend reading this trilogy. A beautiful conclusion to an amazing trilogy. Rating: 55 stars
Prodigy exceeded my expectations by a mile. We all know the middle book syndrome but Marie Lu managed to avoid that pit. Prodigy wasnt just good, it was spectacularly written, the plot was crafty, and so much better than Legend. Prodigy had its own main plot and it didnt aimlessly go on like some middle books. The stakes are so much higher here; we have an assassination plot, finding people, trying to start a revolution against the Republics, and a lot of backstabbing. What is surprising was alliances were formed that we wouldnt have expected, not in a million years. Prodigy is also told from both Day and Junes POV. Dont go thinking there is much romance and a love triangle or square, because throughout the book, the romance was insignificant to me in comparison to the big plans going on. Yes, there is progression in the romance, some heartbreaks and a horrible cliffhanger, but for the most part Marie Lu stuck to the true meaning of the dystopian genre. I loved that Day and June spent a big portion of the novel apart because this way Lu was able to cover a big portion of the plot and more action. The direction of the plot that Lu took hooked me. The assassination plot allowed the whole book to progress in a way that kept the readers excited as well as allowed her to give us hints and here and there and create a few subplots, such as the relationship between Day and Tess. I also loved how Day and June have become celebrities in the eyes of the population and how Marie Lu used the whole revolutionary theme to free America in Prodigy. In terms of the characters, I found Day to be a tiny bit to be easily mistrustful of June and easily persuaded by the people around him. As for June, I think she out shined everyone in Prodigy. I have to admit that I wasnt the biggest fan of her in Legend but she stole my heart in Prodigy. She was kick butt, rational, logical, never lost sight of the plan and faithful. Tess, for me, was very annoying and a jealous kid throughout the whole novel and I just couldnt stand her. We also have the new Elector who I surprisingly warmed up to. All in all, I would highly recommend fans of Legend to pick up Prodigy as soon as possible, and for fans of dystopian novels who havent picked up Legend, to do so as soon as possible! This series is one of the best dystopian novels I have read!
Book: The Fault in Our Stars Author: John Green Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars This was actually the first John Green book that read and I only read it because I saw the movie trailer. It was this book that got me into John Green. Now, I know there has been a lot of negative reviews surrounding The Fault in Our Stars and I can really see why people dont like it. This book does not cover anything new nor will it be a great work of literature. It is a young adult book, plain and simple. However, it is one of those young adult books that stands out in my mind. Hazel Grace and Gus are our lead couple. They both have cancer and are attending a support group. This is how they meet. Their adventures together are so real and so much fun! You just cannot help but falling in love with them. They are real peopleor just about as real as it gets in a book. Are they prefect? No! I think this is the element that makes them real. Are you going to hate John Green for making you fall in love with his characters? Yup! Gus is so funny with all of his metaphors. For example, putting the cigarette in his mouth, but not lighting it...Um, who comes up with all of this? I also like how he tried to make everyone around him feel better, even if he wasnt feeling all that great himself. He is just full of love and life, which will draw you into his character. Hazel Grace is not supposed to be alive. She is only here because of some kind of miracle drug, which will not get rid of the cancer, but will give her a chance to live. She is only living until she meets Gus, then she starts to experience and actually enjoy life. Hello! She goes to the Netherlands to find out how a book ends! Her and Gus are such opposites and this is what makes them work! Now, the ending! Okay, when you are reading a cancer story, you just have to prepare yourself for the fact that one of the main characters is going to die orand face some kind of hardship. We do have that here. If you are reading the reviews closely, it probably has already been spoiled for you. The ending is just truly heartbreaking. Overall, a great read! I know I enjoyed it and read it in just two sittings!
What a sweet story : Full review coming soon. Full review can be found here:  Do you know what drew me to this book? WAFFLES. Short recap: Jessie is the new girl in school, having moved in with her dad. Shortly after starting at her new school, she starts receiving emails from Somebody Nobody. SN offers to help Jessie get to know her new school and something she needs: a friend. This was a fun story to read. Jessies character felt real as she was both frustrating and genuine. She was also naive but charming and you couldnt help but like her. I enjoyed how she questioned everything but wanted to believe the best in people. Sounds like I would be friends with her in real life. The super fun part of this story is trying to figure out who SN could possibly be. Is it a sweet guy that wants to catch Jessies eye? Liam? Caleb? Ethan? I liked all three of these guys! Liam and Ethan were musicians, while Caleb and Liam were good friends. There is a reason for any of these boys to be SN but the mystery is not revealed until the end and I was so excited when SN was revealed! It was just who I wanted it to be. heart eye emoji Do know that this is not just a book about a mysterious SN emailing Jessie wanting to be her friend. This always deals with friendships, families, and grief. This is just just about a boy with a crush. There are some heavier topics and I think Buxbaum did a great job with all of it. She wrote about how important friends and family really are. Nobodys family is perfect so we all have to do our best to make it great. I felt that between Jessie and her dad. Their bond really made me smile. I wish more books had great dads like hers. The way Buxbaum also handled the loss of a parent was well done. That is never an easy topic and one authors normally shy away from, but it was covered in a very tasteful and appropriate way. Well done, Julie. I enjoyed this so much more than I thought I would. I tore through this and was sort of sad when I was finished. I almost wanted my own SN to email me. Ignore the negative reviews and give this one a try. Make your own judgement on it but know that I thought it was adorable and cannot wait to ready Buxbaums next novel.
The Girl On The Train is the debut novel from author Paula Hawkins and when it first came out early last year there was a lot of hype surrounding it. Of course, Im a bit of a sucker for hype and I knew I had to read it to check out what the fuss was all about. I do get a teensy bit annoyed like some other bloggers Im sure when a book is declared the next insert name of very popular book here, in this case it was The next Gone Girl, because I didnt really feel it had too many similarities with Gone Girl to be honest! The book stands on its own as a great psychological thriller, a story with an edge and multiple twists that is exciting to read and intricately plotted leaving me in glorious anticipation over what the author may do next. My favourite thing about this book and where I think it is most comparable to Gone Girl is the number of unreliable narrators. We mainly hear from Rachel who is divorced, a bit overweight and incredibly unhappy. She has a very shaky relationship with her exhusband, relies a smidge too much on alcohol to see her through each day  to the point where she has actually lost her job. Too ashamed to tell anyone, which might actually lead to her having to face her problems she continues to get the same train into work each day, manages to fill each day randomly which usually involves drinking then gets the train home again when her working day should have officially ended. Her train route passes by her old house which her exhusband now shares with his new wife, Anna and their baby girl, tellingly something that Rachel herself was unable to give him. However, it is a house close to her old homestead that catches her eye whilst on the train. Every morning she watches a couple breakfasting together on their terrace and soon begins to fantasise about their fairytale life together, even naming them Jess and Jason. One particular day, when looking for her favourite couple, she witnesses something that shocks her to her core. Unable to rest until she gets to the bottom of what has occurred, Rachel drags herself into the couples life which leads to her forming a separate link to her exhusband and his wife again. Prone to blackouts from her drinking benders, can Rachels accounts ever be trusted? And what of our other unreliable narrators Anna and Megan the female half of the couple Rachel views from the train? Im not going to spoil why theyre unreliable, I think the less you know going into this novel, the better but believe me, youll be scratching your head to unravel the convoluted plot that Paula Hawkins has magically woven. This is a truly thrilling story for fans of the genre, is certainly one Ill be revisiting in the future and Im already eagerly awaiting the authors next novel.

I think this is the first time Ive ever said this: the TV show is better. It may not be entirely fair to judge a book based on a TV show that I started first, but when a book is made into a TV show or a movie, I expect it to be a more interesting than The 100 was. What is so disappointing about this book is that it could have and should have been amazing. The premise of sending convicted teens to Earth, a place that has been uninhabited for centuries and a place that may or may not still be radioactive from a war, is something I can get behind. After watching the show and having things I didnt like, I wanted to see what they changed from the book. Answer: A LOT. Basically, everything I like about the show ArkerGrounder budding friendships, relationships, and alliances is not at all in The 100. I understand now, after finishing the book, why it was made into a show. Its because the book is basically a blank slate. The summary of the book tells almost as much as what the book tells you. There was a problem with telling in this book. We were told about what happened on Earth in the past and what is happening on the station. Were not shown how Earth has changed on account of the radiation. The background behind the characters actions was blank. They could have been in an empty room for all they cared. This is a world that could have been so interesting. I was really disappointed it wasnt. The reason it wasnt is because instead of a dystopian novel with a little bit of romance, we were given a romance novel with a teensytiny bit of dystopia. The summary makes this book sound like an epic survival story: Confronted with a savage land and haunted by secrets from their pasts, the hundred well, sort of. Just the four that the POVs are in must fight to survive. Um, sure...I guess theres one character who goes hunting for the others. One deer and a few odd smaller animals is good enough for almost 100 people, right? They were never meant to be heroes, but they may be mankinds last hope. If theyre mankinds last hope, I dont really hold out hope for mankind. The characters were whiny and idiotic and didnt act at all as if they were on a planet that was dangerous. If I were in their situation, Id be a little more concerned about how I was going to survive over a cute boy. The only character who was marginally smart was Bellamy; Wells, Clarke, and Glass were more concerned with their romance prospects. The characters are bland and boring, world building doesnt exist, theres only a small blip of action, and the way that time passes is strange. Have they been on Earth one day? Five? A few months? Theres no mention at all of time passing. I do not recommend this book at all. If youre interested, check out the show. It expands the world considerably.
I am giving this four stars to reflect that as a book, I can see that there are some issues, possibly enough to push it down into three star territory, but that as a reader, John Green hits me in all the right places so my personal experience with this story is five stars. A teen romance in which Hazel and Gus meet in a support group for victims of pediatric cancer! What can possibly go wrong? I read this in nearly one sitting on purpose, why wouldnt you luxuriate in a good sob fest when the opportunity presents itself?. Okay, so the things that mmmmm, maybe lazy on the part of Mr. Green. What is UP with Hazels favorite book being about a teenager with cancer? This feels like such a plot device to me, because everything else about Hazel convinces me that her favorite book should be about ANYTHING other than illness. It was completely predictable maybe another issue that it eventually turns out that the one adult who is actively mean to Hazel ends up having his own personally sad backstory, and this felt backwards to me  that in order to bring this type of character in, the favorite book was chosen to have a convenient way to bring in this particular voice. The other thing is both a problem, bookwise, and why I enjoyed it so much  and that is that as always, Greens characters are way too good to be true. Hazel and Augustus are completely awesome! All the time! Even when theyre supposed to have flaws, their flaws are better than your own teenage flaws. I understand so much why this bothers people about I think just about all of John Greens books. But man alive, it works for me every time. I like reading about the teenagers that I want to believe I could have been if only I hadnt spent my teenage years getting in my own way all the time. Of course thats inherently a delusion; the things that you think are stopping you from being the person you are in your own head are actually what makes you your true person, but I like indulging in the fantasy that my Own True Self is not so mundane and engages in witty conversation all the time. Just in case anyone wants to commiserate, its hard to pick ONE tragic moment in this story, but maybe the worst was the scene at the gas station. JESUS.
Originally posted at OMFG!Books Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Heartbreaking. Authentic. These worlds immediately sprung to mind the second I finished The Last Time We Say Goodbye. I absolutely loved Cynthias Unearthly series so I had a feeling that I would love this book too. And yeah, I did. More than I loved Unearthly, even. Lexs brother died. He committed suicide and it turned Lexs world upside down as it would anyone. Before she had her family together, a boyfriend, and like the synopsis said, friends who didnt look at her like she might break down at any moment. First, let me start with the writing. It was beautiful, absolutely. I loved that we were able to see Lexs present but also what lead up to Tys death. We got to know Ty  through Lexs journal that her therapist told her to write in  to see him and what he went through and what led to his suicide. While I dont personally know anyone who has committed suicide, I know people with mental health issues and who have attempted. I know what its like to have depression and I know how hard it is to get through it sometimes. Cynthia captured it perfectly: the turmoil of the person that committed suicide themselves and the lives of those left behind. Lexs pain and grief jumped out of the page at me, it felt so raw and so real. She blamed herself. She couldnt cry, she couldnt let it out, because no one knew just how deep her pain and blame went. She feels like shes going crazy because she keeps seeing Ty everywhere, what she thinks is his ghost, and she begins to fracture even more. That is such a real thing, such a normal thing, but she cant believe that and thinks shes losing it. I loved seeing Lexs friends. All of their reactions are so normal to a death by suicide. They see their friend fragile too, like at any moment Lex could break so they treat her with a tender touch but Lex doesnt see it that way. This is so normal, for anyone who knows someone that died. They dont know how to react and all of Lexs friends reactions in the book are so normal. The Last Time We Say Goodbye is a book that is going to stay with me. Its one of those reads that Ill carry around with me and think about from time to time. Its as much haunting as it is beautiful. It is about grief and loss and learning to accept it. It is about moving on as much as it is about mental illness and suicide. It was so, so good.
I have been waiting for this book for MONTHS! It came out last week and I devoured it in a few hours. I just could not put this baby down! All of the rave reviews Ive been reading everywhere are well deserved, and I find myself agreeing with the reviewers that said this book is as good as The Hunger Games. Yeah, I said it. I know thats a lot to live up to, but I was that impressed. And as much as I hate to compare books that really are very different, this book has inevitably been compared to HG because a. Dystopia. Duh. and b. it features a kickass female heroine. But thats pretty much where the similarity ends. This book is good because its good, not because its anything like the Hunger Games. Its awesome. Just awesome. The story is unique, compelling, fastpaced. The characters are crisp and complex. Emotional depth is packed high from start to finish and the writing is wonderful. The love story is secondary to the actual plot, and I totally dug it. In fact, I find that most YA books that I really LOVE feature issues that dont revolve who is going to take the heroine to the prom, but instead focus on deeper, more meaningful struggles, like who the heroine wants to be. This book accomplishes that with flying colors. Also? Veronica Roth is only 22 years old. TWENTY TWO years old, people! I had that in the back of my mind the entire time I was reading this book and let me tell you, you should too. Her writing is clean and mature, and I really had a hard time believing that this was a debut novel. Many kudos to you, Ms. Roth. Really quick, let me tell you a little bit about the concept: Society has collapsed and been rebuilt. The remaining people in this case, living in Chicago have been divided into different factions based on their dominant personality traits. For example, people who value peaces are sorted into Amity; people who are selfless are sorted into Abnegations; and so on. However, people who show more than one dominant personality trait are labeled Divergent, and thats where this book begins. Its action packed and exciting, just an absolute treat to read, and I KNOW that yall are going to love it. I am SO going to be recommending this book to everyone I know.
5 rating. First and foremost I am grateful. Grateful to find out that I am not the cynical snobreader I thought I was turning into, who couldnt feel a flicker of emotion through the past dozen books prior to this one. It was just the wrong books. Most young adult books out there are not worth reading and if you do not care about the characters  not even if they live or die  its probably not due to a personality fault in you. This novel is an entirely different category. This book deserves a place in my hall of hallowed books. Its a very long hall with very few books. Of the thousands of books I have read far more than are registered on goodreads maybe two dozen books are shelved here and the fault in our stars is the latest addition. I cannot do this book the justice it deserves with a review  my words are measly by its lofty standard  but I will try. I loved this book, I loved the characters and I bawled my eyes out for at least half of it. I have never read a book that deals so gently and profoundly with mortality. Memento mori. Except wed rather not. Every human would prefer to think theyre immortal, that there will never be a time when oblivion and nonexistence stands before our door. Its particularly unfair when that time comes before youve really had a chance to live, as is the case with the main character in this book. Hazel, age 16, terminal stage IV cancer. I wont give a synopsis  there is so little I could say without revealing spoilers. However, Hazel is forced to a cancer support group and there she meets someone new  a gorgeous, handsome teenage boy  Augustus  who cant stop staring at her. Their story is not at all predictable. If you give a damn about fictional characters, if words come to life for you  then read this book. Forget cancer and teenage love. That is not what this book is about. It is about life. Love, yes  but not puppy love. Our human smallness in the vastness of the universe. Of time, who is a slut that screws us all, to paraphrase a line from the book. Read it. There never was a story that deserved to be read as much as this one.
Im going to start off by saying that I Absolutely Loved this book it has become one of my top favorites of 2015. Melissa once again outdid herself with this story, I was so taken by the MCs that I, at times forgot I was reading and they werent actual real life people. Melissa hit on a subject that was so sensitive and some might want to push it under the rug and forget that it ever happened but the way the writing in this story was done so brilliantly, I felt myself feeling every single emotion that these two men were going through, I laughed with them and I also cried with them I wanted to reach in and hug them and reassure both Liam and Parker that everything will be ok. Liam Davis is hiding a very troubled past which he has worked so hard all his life to hide and try to move on. Liam has been working as a mechanic for ten years now after been given a chance in life as a young teen that saved his life. Parker Ryan a very well know high profile lawyer who has been working at his fathers law firm and to see him everyone would say.. he is a Man that has it al but as we all know looks can be deceiving. A chance meeting happens when Parker walks into the shop needing help with his car, the attraction between these two is immediate with neither knowing if the other is Gay. Liam sees Parker as a rich stuck up snob but sexy as hl. Parker realizes he made a bad impression so he kicks up his charm trying to work his charm on Liam, but... Liam has trust issues so its not such an easy task getting him to open up and the journey that transpires between Parker and Liam is one that you will not want to miss. I also was amazed at how Melissa wrote in the secondary characters and how much of an impact they made in this story and with Parker and Liam. If you keep thinking about all the reasons its not going to work, chances are it wont. After briefly pressing his lips against mine, quickly stealing a second kiss, he said, But youre lucky Im very persistent. Ill be right there to show you all the reasons itll be worth the try. Trust me? And yes you will see that Parker is very determined and persistent. Ok Ill stop here because I can keep going on and on but I do not want to ruin this beautiful story for anyone so please Go One Click This Beauty Now!!
Can we just talk for a minute about how much I loved North and South?! I was introduced to Elizabeth Gaskell through my aesthetician. Because doesnt everyone talk classic literature while getting their nails done? We had discovered our shared love of Jane Austen and all things Brit lit. The woman asks me if Ive ever read North and South, and my immediate reaction is  the book by John Jakes about the American Civil War? She laughs and says, no  the book by the Victorian writer Elizabeth Gaskell! Id never heard of her before! She then told me that I absolutely HAD TO read North and South. Her recommendation to me in reading this book was the following: Jane Austen was never married, so she probably never had sex either. Elizabeth Gaskell was married to a man that she deeply loved  and it TOTALLY SHOWS in this book. I was a bit taken aback because  lets be real  Victorian literature is usually known for its restraint in that department. But I figured I would give it a go. All I can say is that she was SO RIGHT. What Elizabeth Gaskell does with words in this book is amazing. Unlike most romance fiction of today, where the love is thrown in your face and is very hard to believe, the love story in North and South is nuanced and grows quietly. There is so much beauty and grace in all the little moments between Margaret Hale and John Thornton. I literally felt the love grow between them as the story progressed. I was SO invested in these characters!! Also, when Margaret experiences deep loss and suffering in the book, the way in which these scenes were written was so authentic. Again, I feel like Gaskell writes from real experience, and so everything Margaret and John go through seems that much more relatable and true. If it were possible, John Thornton now ranks higher in my book of fictional, male protagonist crushes than anyone else. If I met a John Thorntonesque guy on the street today, I would marry him in a second. No joke. But aside from the masterful writing and brilliant character development, this book also touches on the tensions between masters and workers during the Industrial Revolution. You cant help but love Higgins and some of the other mill workers that Margaret befriends. Margaret is one step removed from the labor conflict between the other parties, so you get to see different ideas and thoughts bounced around in a more balanced way through her perspective. Its been a long time since I sat up reading into the wee hours of the morning in a book dubbed a classic. I love classics, and I enjoy reading them, but they dont often pull me in with such force! North and South is brilliant on so many levels!
Words cannot express how much I love Clockwork Princess and every book Cassandra Clare has written. I have a hard time reviewing books in general, but when it is a book such as this one, my words become jumbled and my thoughts swirl around in my head because there is SO much to say. I cannot imagine a better ending to this series. Cassie is such an extraordinary author; her writing not only inspires me, but sets the bar to limitless heights and I can only pray that one day I will be able to touch the edges of what she has mastered as an author. There is a reason she is my very favorite author and that her stories and writing have compelled me to read and reread her amazing novels. Clockwork Princess wraps up the Infernal Devices series beautifully. Cassie could not have possibly satisfied her readers, whether they wished Tessa to end up with Will or Jem, any more then she has done with this amazing book. I am in awe and heartbroken, and overjoyed, and sad that the series is over, and ecstatic that Cassie ripped our hearts out just enough for it to hurt, but then mended the peices back together a few times over. I cant help but gush and gush about her writing, but she deserves every praise she has ever received to the higher power of a million. So, I think it is safe to ask: Cassie, if you are reading this; I love you! Will you marry me? Hahaha On a more serious note, as I have already stated, I am in complete awe of how this series was wrapped up. Among my happiness lies hope that my most favorite series The Mortal Instruments will end in the same manner and that Cassie will not dissapoint her loyal followers. Not, I might add, that I hold little faith in her ability, just that sometimes she can be cruel... coughMaxcough! There will be no summarizing of this book from me, not that is a big suprise for any of you who have ever read my reviews. I just needed to jot down the emotions and thoughts that reading Clockwork Princess has filled me with. I have about a thousand books that I have yet to read and the only thing I want to do right now is curl up and either reread this series or reread The Mortal Instruments series. And for those of you who figured out who Brother Zachariah was while reading City of Lost Souls, you are fanfreakingtastic. I love being right, and then wrong, and then right again. Cassie definitely keeps us guessing! I love her I love her I love her!
Aelin Galathynius, Queen of Terrasen, knew the time would soon come to prove just how much shed bleed for Erilea. Stars Out of 10: This book made its own scale entirely, its so good it doesnt even apply to it Overall Thoughts: Oh my ever loving gods, THIS BOOK! I waited so long for this book, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Yes, it took me a whole month to finish this book, and yes it has been a long long while since a book has actively taken me this long to finish, but that was just because I didnt want the waiting to begin, didnt want to lose one of my favorite series tied with ACOTAR again for another year. Every single thing in this book surprised me in the best way possible. Everything has begun to come full circle, and all this build up from the series is starting to mean something. This book made me love almost every character more for many various reasons, and the world was revealed to us in a million more stories and flashbacks, and I am so ready to see where this all leads. Sarah J Maas is, without a doubt, my favorite author of all time, and this book only solidified that position. SPOILERS BEGIN HERE The Good: Everything, everything, everything. Since I do explain more in depth below, Im not gonna go too specific in those characters though. Something that definitely goes into this category is just how Maas writes in general. She balances emotion and fact, and has mastered the art of keeping me interested even if the scene isnt necessarily exciting. I love how she writes all varieties of scenes, from emotional, to action, to tactical, to romantic. The Bad: The fact that I need to wait a year for the next book with an ending like that torturing me!!! The Characters: I did not think it was possibly to love these characters more than I did. Im amazed with how skilled and tactical Aelin has grown, and how much she has matured over this series. I love the bonds we see between her and everyone, from Rowan to Lysandra to Aedion to basically everyone. I also loved all the old characters we saw again, especially from the prequel book. I also absolutely fell in love with Lysandra, and the strength we see from her in this book. And just the sea dragon she became!! The Plot: I loved both the plot of just this book, and how the entire plot of the series has progressed! We see every single thing Aelin has done come back to build her empire, from Ansel and the Silent Assassins, to Rolfe, to Galan, and to every other little thing. She is no longer the scared of power Celaena we saw in TOG and COM, but has evolved into a strong and tactical queen, ready to sacrifice everything. She was smart, planning every step and every move, The Favorite Character: Can I actually just put everyone? Because basically everyone was amazing except you know Maeve and the evil guys that I would rather put in a hole in the ground than anywhere near this category! :  Buy it, Borrow it, or Bin it: Buy it! and everything by Sarah J. Maas in general This review can also be found on my blog: 
Id rather die on an adventure than live standing still. This book was completely fascinating. It was a cocktail of Harry Potter, the Firebird series and to a certain degree, Mortal Instruments. A recipe of parallel worlds and magic can either result to a tasteless disaster or a tale cooked to perfection given the right portions of each. Fortunately, The Darker Shade of Magic was the latter. I was treated to a unique plot and a cornucopia of very captivating characters. Three parallel worlds  or possibly 4 . First, there is White London, with a despotic and ruthless pair of royal siblings at the helm. Then Gray London, where magic has all but disappeared, and from where our heroine wishes to escape. Red London with the good fortune of having kind monarchs and what seems to be a flourishing world. And lastly, Black London, believed to have been completely extinguished by greed and lust for magical power. Kell is an enigmatic necromancer, adopted by the royal family of Red London and tasked with traveling to parallel worlds to deliver correspondences. While Lila is a cross dressing thief from Gray London, who thirsted for adventure. The two are thrown together by a black magic stone, and embark on a quest to return it to Black London where it belongs. Throughout their journey, they engage Athos and Astrid, the ruthless rulers of White London, and their Antari, Holland. All seeking to control the powerful magic that comes from the stone, with the end vision of conquering all the parallel worlds. In the process, Kell and Lilas bond grow even stronger, but not without sacrifice. I loved that the story revolved around the adventure more than the romance. Though judging from how the relationship between Kell and Lila has evolved, I would not be surprised if the sequel starts delving into it. The idea of traversing parallel worlds is just utterly fascinating, but it can also be very confusing and hard to keep track of, so we rely heavily on the author to bring these worlds to life. I must say that V.E. Schwab did such a fine job of it. Not only was each world so vividly described, even the transitions from one world to the other were done seamlessly. I always knew which world I was living vicariously in, through her words. Though the build up was a bit slow on the uptake, I still thoroughly enjoyed it, and I am looking forward to the sequel. I am almost certain the second installment brings with it the blossoming of Kell and Lilas love story, as well as the awakening of the heroines magical powers, hinted at in the first book. I definitely cannot wait to get started on it.
THIS BOOK, GUYS. THIS BOOK. Im always wary of going into books with a lot of hype surrounding them because its so easy to end up disappointed. I cant count how many times Ive seen this book praised on my Twitter feed, so I was very curious to start reading. And let me tell you, it did not let me down. The story follows Simon, a high school pupil who has started talking to a fellow gay student at the same school online. But Simon doesnt know who the other boy is. They both communicate via false names, Jacques and Blue. Through all of their emails, Simon has gotten to know Blue without actually meeting him in person, and as the story progresses, he is desperate to find out Blues true identity. Reading this book so late after its publication, Im pretty proud of myself that I was still able to go into it without having Blues character spoiled! It drove me insane in the best kind of way. That element of mystery, the constant search for clues, it all helped make this book such an excited read. Another thing that makes this book so great is the characters. Simon himself has just the right amount of wit and edge to him that makes him interesting to follow. His thoughts and feelings are written well enough to put the reader in his shoes and see things from his pointofview. I appreciated the scenes with his friends and the way Simon viewed the difference in his friendships. A character who had me torn throughout this book was Martin. His way of treating Simon made me angry, but the way his story is resolved is an important one. The relationship between Simon and Blue was just adorable. Honestly, I didnt know how Id feel about the relationship being built purely through email, but because of the way their emails were written, it worked so perfectly. I couldnt help but root for them. The way they slowly revealed more about their lives and their feelings through their messages was beautiful. I was about as nervous as Simon was when it came to finding out Blues identity! I did figure who he really was a few chapters before the end thanks to the clues throughout the book, so I had my little moment of triumph when it was revealed. This story is just full of fun moments and exciting characters, but it also touches upon some more serious and relatable topics as well. There was some particularly great commentary from Simon when he realised that straight and white shouldnt be the default, and I really appreciated little moments like that. Im so glad I finally got a chance to read this one, and Im beyond excited for the upcoming movie!
As most of you know, this book is Hopeless told from Holders POV. I absolutely LOVED Hopeless. In my opinion, it was superior to Slammed  I also realize Im in the minority here. Everything about Hopeless had me sucked in like a black hole in space. The story was heartbreaking but also beautiful. So of course I was dying to see it from the males POV. I believe I have said it before, but I ALWAYS enjoy the guys side a little more. So I have to thank Colleen Hoover for writing this book because everything I thought I felt in Hopeless is amplified by 390287645 in Losing Hope. Losing Hope starts off in quite the heartbreaking manner. We get more of a back story into what made Holder who he was when he met SkyHope again. Reliving his experiences is even more emotional than anything we read in Hopeless. Even though were led to believe this is the same story, it really isnt. There is so much more than we ever knew and Im so blown away by this book. I loved getting into Holders head and learning what made him tick. All those moments we had to guess at what he was thinking are now answered. I have to applaud Colleen because I wasnt sure this could be better than Hopeless. Whatever you thought you knew and felt about him before is nothing. If you loved him before, you will fall in live with him all over again. I guarantee it. Some of my favorite things: 1. The notebook  Holy heart clenches! There were so many entries that had me crying. Amazingly powerful. 2. The humor. Daniel is by far one of the funniest characters! I absolutely LOLd at his names for everyone. Not to mention his performance in the cafeteria. It definitely made some of the depressing aspects easier to swallow. 3. Getting the rest of the story. We missed out on so much when we read from Skys POV. Things that seemed douchey at the time are explained. You will fully appreciate every decision he made. 4. Watching him fall in love. Oh, Holder! This book catapulted him into top 10 BBF status. He always manages to say the perfect things exactly when theyre needed. One of my favorite lines from the book came from him: I wonder if its possible for people to fall in love with a person one characteristic at a time, or if you fall for the entire person at once. And then to have them list each item as he fell in love with it... sigh Losing Hope is now one of my favorite books I have read this year. Colleen Hoover has truly outdone herself with this one. I literally started reading and found myself taking breaks just to prolong its greatness. You realize early on that this one is special. Losing Hope is a little bit of perfection. I adored it and would rate it 10 stars!
Addison Coleman is a divergent, or the more accustomed to term Clairvoyant. She lives inside a compound with other people with powers like her. That is the para world she has always known. However when her parents drop the bomb that is any childs nightmare, a divorce, she has to decide who she is going to live with. Her mother, in the para world, or her father, who will be moving to the Norm world. Which is the world where us normal little beings live in right now. So what does Addie do? she uses her power whenever she is faced with a hard decision, this one in particular she looks 6 weeks ahead into the outcomes of both paths. This plot.. this genius plot, in my opinion, allowed Kasie West to create a dual and parallel timewise reality where the chapters interchange between the Para and Norm world and follow Addie. I honestly felt like I was reading two novels.. one that is purely contemporary Norm world while the other is contemporary with a hint of paranormal Para world. I loved how they were mostly independent of each other, but you still get glimpses of both worlds when the schools play against each other and you meet characters and see them through the eyes of the other world. In terms of world building and just what is more appealing to me, I preferred the Norm world. If you ever pick up the book youll know why in the end, but from the beginning that was the reality I preferred. We have Trevor, the sweeter than honey oh yea I went there cowboy who was the star quarterback of his school until his injury, as well as the group of friends he hangs out with and Addie gets introduced to. I just loved Trevor and found him to be a great and layered character. As for the Para world, Addie starts hanging out with Duke, the cocky quarterback at her school; her life no different than it really was before. She has her best friend to hang out with, and now, the all mighty, Duke. In terms of character depth and world building, I believe the Norm world was superior over the Para world. Now, you are probably wondering what is the whole point of this book? well, what I can say is that the decision that Addie will make, moving to the Norm or staying in the Para world, could result in dangerous situations, one more dangerous and lethal than the other. I kept on reading this book nonstop because I couldnt put it down, not because of this decision she has to make. I was sucked into both worlds and enjoyed every minute of it. Addie, was a great female protagonist; She was independent, confident, and just fun to read about. I squealed when I found out that there is a sequel to this novel and I cant wait for it. I just need to point out how beautiful the cover is. I need this book in my life for the writing youre awesome Kasie and also for this beautiful cover. goes off to buy a copy at the bookstore
I have read a lot of books and this is the first time I have ever, ever woke up in the morning with my eyes swollen from all the crying I did the night before, because of a book! If you are not in the mood to have a very emotional cry, I dont mean a few tears, I mean an ugly, nose blowing, tears streaming cry then you should not read this book. If you are looking for a book that will reach into your soul and touch you in a way not many books do then read away. This book grabbed me in the very first chapter and never let me go. Kate grew up in a small town next door to her best friend Beau, whom she secretly loved. She never expected her world to be torn apart on what should have been a typical Friday night. After that night, Kate changes and pushes everyone away. The only person who wont leave is Beau but she still wont let him in. Then it is time for Beau to leave for collage and he lays his heart on the line for Kate. She still loves him but feels she can never be the person he needs or deserves, she is too broken. After Beau leaves Asher walks into Kates life. She never expects to get out of the dark hole that is her life but Asher helps lift her up and see that she can be happy again. Beau is running from his own secrets, but they find something in each other that can finally heal the pain they both have. Kate falls in love, she never wants to hurt Beau but she cannot deny what she feels for Asher and she only ever promised Beau friendship. Kate finally believes she has found her happiness to discover Asher has another secret one that will probably destroy her. I dont want to give too much away but I will say this book is full of love and all the characters are great. I loved Asher and Kate. I also love Beau. I felt badly for Beau but there is no cheating and every love in this book is pure. It is heart warming and heart breaking. Even though your heart breaks in this book I was pleased with the ending and would like to hear more about his couple in the future.
Cath lives in the world of Simon and Baz. Fantasy characters from the bestselling Simon Snow series. She has written countless fan fiction stories, and is striving to finish her novel length fic before the final book in the series comes out. She is starting her first year of college at UNL with her twin sister Wren, who is pushing away from Cath with the intentions of starting her own life. All this change is far too much for Cath to handle. Due to her social anxiety and fears she tries to close in on herself even more, but her big personality roommate Regan, and Regans friend Levi wont let her. They have, much against Caths insistence, decided to make her their friend project. Though Levi means it in every nice way imaginable. Cath tries her best at balancing her fandom and her personal life, but wonders, can she do it all on her own? Though I did not have any immediate interest in this book, Im a guy and come on, the cover and title didnt exactly make me want to read this my love for Rowells other works made me pick this up and I really did enjoy it. Cath is wonderful character who I could see a bit of myself in, and her social anxieties and fears make her one of the most endearing characters I have read in YA fiction. I have commended Rowell on her characterization skills before, and they really do shine. She is amazing at building relatable, likable characters, that you legitimately care for and she seems like the type of author that really insets pieces of her life into the story. I also loved how Rowell gives her characters parents and family. Too many times characters act as if they are completely alone and reference their parents little. Cath and Wrens relationship with their father was nice to see and Rowell shows that families are always a little screwed up, but thats what makes it so much more real. Caths romance was handled with deft skill and realism, proving that yes, I do enjoy a good romance on occasion. I, being from Lincoln, loved how all of the story was set locally. The University of Nebraska Campus is portrayed perfectly and every place referenced was somewhere I have been. For me, the local setting made the story even more special and I think other readers from Lincoln will feel this way also. If you havent read Rainbow Rowells books before, find one. You will not be disappointed.
A TOP SHELF review, originally published in the August 29, 2013 edition of The Monitor In 1960, author Harper Lee published her first and only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, to unexpected public and critical acclaim. The book won the Pulitzer Prize that year and became an Oscarwinning film. Taught in schools across the nation, translated into dozens of languages, selling more than 30 million copies, the book is cited by many as lifealtering. The plot is straightforward and somewhat episodic. In the small town of Maycomb, Ala., at the height of the Great Depression, a poor white woman accuses a black man of rape. The court appoints lawyer Atticus Finch to defend the man, and he endeavors to do so with a quiet dignity, courage and love for humanity that cannot fail to inspire the reader. Atticus, a widower, has two children: his son, Jeremy Atticus Jem, and his daughter, Jean Louise Scout Finch, the narrator of the novel, whose puckish innocence and precocious intelligence inform the dark exploration of smalltown racism in a voice that is at turns delightfully amusing and devastatingly moving. The siblings and their friend Dill spend a couple of summers learning the disturbing secrets behind the Maycombs gentle exterior, and as the trial nears and the towns turns against Atticus with greater aggression, they come to admire his strength in not compromising his ethics. When the verdict is handed down and consequences spin out of control, Scout will learn to see the world through the eyes of others, to climb inside of their skin and walk around in it. For an author transmitting such an intense moral message, Lee manages never to be heavyhanded or moralistic. There is considerable humor and very cinematic suspense, and the lessons learned are often couched in the ironic, gleeful drawl of Southern sensibility. Even the hero of the book, Atticus  easily one of the most admirable creations in American letters  is not some idealistic warrior for race relations: he retains a black cook, Calpurnia, whom he treats as a member of the family, but he largely acts toward AfricanAmericans as a good, responsible adult does toward innocent children. They are human in his eyes, deserving of respect, but he arguably doesnt see them as his intellectual equals. Rather than fault Lee for this flaw in her hero, I welcome it. Like all of us, Atticus struggles day to day to be a better man and improve others as well. The story of his daughters realization of her fathers true nature is heartwrenchingly real. Harper Lee never wrote another novel, but she didnt need to, really. As she reportedly quipped a few years ago, I have said what I wanted to say, and I will not say it again.
It is going to be oh so difficult to be able to write a coherent review because this book literally chewed up and spit me out. It took everything out of me but made sure to give it right back. Im smiling like a damn loon because of how incredibly amazing this book was. It lived up to its hype and then some. To be honest, I wasnt sure if I wanted to read this right away. The format was what kind of threw me. Having an entire story be told through emails, chat logs and other such things, I thought for sure I wouldnt like it. I felt like I would be missing a lot of the story and things would just get way too confusing. I was wrong. Oh god, was I wrong. Having the story written this way made it much more dynamic. I felt like I was living each of those moments with each of those characters. I loved the relationship between Kady and Ezra, even when they were barely speaking. Kady is such a badass. I love that she is good with computers. It helps to normalize that women can be into computers and its completely okay. She knows who she is and she isnt going to apologize for it. She is strong and takes no nonsense from anybody. But I loved how she showed weakness and emotion. My heart bled for her during the rough parts. I cheered for her during the victories. Ezra was awesome too. He knew when he messed up and owned up to it. He was the first to apologize and he actually listened to Kady! The chat logs between those two just made me laugh. They are both so damn sassy, strong willed and stubborn. I loved it! ADIAN was creepy to me but in a strange weird way, I liked it. I know that a lot of people really liked him but man, he was something else. I guess I liked him. He made me like him. Ive never had a character force me to like him when all instinct told me not too. I liked how his part of the story was told. The black pages and white lettering was a really cool effect. The way the wording was all over the page was pretty sweet as well. I even liked all the garbled code. It made him really come alive as a robot...AI....whatever the hell he is. I just cant get over how cool this book was. It was like nothing I have ever read. I hope that my review made some sort of sense. I really did try to focus my excitement into something cohesive. I very most highly recommend this. Dont let the formatting of this book scare you away. I promise, it is worth it. Be prepared to have your heart ripped out, stomped on and thrown right back at you. Your emotions will be at edge the entire time. But I promise. It is worth it.
This book was a deception and Im giving 03 stars taking in consideration the whole series. I was expecting more, at least to have answers for my questions; instead, I ended up with even more questions. This book ruined the series for me. There are a lot of holes and unexplained topics. I still cant understand how the powers work, the author tried to explain so many times but only made more confusing and no sense. The plot wasnt very well developed, it was repetitive and confusing. It took me forever to read the book because I felt like I was stuck on the same part of the story. Some stuff didnt make sense. My first problem with the book started at the name of the place. She could choose any other place, but she chose no name key. First I was thinking Mara was so drugged and confused that she didnt even know the name of the place she was when she already did, if I didnt remember that I saw that name somewhere and that the author grew up in Florida and she used real places names on the previews books, I would be confused for longer. Then there is the scene where they are trying to escape from the facility , and sometimes it bothered me that Mara seemed to enjoy some parts when she had to hurt people, I saw that as a change on her personality. Also, Jamie seemed so afraid of everything, that I want him gone already. I dont like the fact that they spent a long time looking for a way out and then suddenly next chapter they are outside of the facility. . Once they are outside on the beach trying to get some ride to cross waters I got irritated because she used the wrong character to swim until the guys to convince them to help them. It didnt make any sense instead of using the one with persuasion power Jamie , she used another one Stella, because Jamie was afraid of sharks . The whole book has a lot of flaws, it didnt make sense that , out of nowhere, on the middle of a search for answers, Mara find her brother looking for answers too. The explanation for him to be there was weak, and the time he appeared and the way it happened was too convenient and made no sense. And if that isnt enough, there is the dierevivedierevivepart. That was annoying, not well explained, confusing and again, made no sense and I couldnt understand the whole process or make sense of the procedure. I dont think it should be that way, one of the character should die there. At the end, what could save the book, by taking the right decision, it turns out to be the most selfish decision I saw. The whole world, somehow in the middle of the not well explained reasons, is in danger if the wrong decision is made, but Mara instead of leaving, decided to stay with Noah even if that will ruin him and put the whole world in danger. . , and that for me, it was a perfect way to show her change of personality wasnt for better, but for worse. The book wasnt good enough, I had too much expectations because the first book was amazing, and the second left me with a cliffhanger, but It was a deception to finish the book with more questions than I had when I started.
THIS REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED ON WHAT A NERD GIRL SAYS This is the strongest book in the trilogy, easily. Weve had the world established in the first novel. We know Katniss and Peeta and the world they live. We understand the cruelty of the Capitol and the heads of Panem, and President Snow and the Gamemakers. We know all this. The Hunger Games is a great book, something that grabbed me from the very first page. But Catching Fire takes it to a whole new level. For one thing, the entirety of Panem grows in this novel, which opens our eyes even more to the cruelty of President Snow and his government. The Victory Tour shows us all the various different districts, and I love that. I think that this is where Katniss really begins to see what effect she had, and that her effect isnt necessarily a bad thing. All shes ever known is District 12 and the small amount of time she spent in the Capitol. Seeing the other districts only fires her up more. I also love that we meet so many new important characters in this novel too like Johanna and Finnick and Plutarch, and people like that. Not only does it open us up to new victors besides Haymitch, but we see how the Games have effected other people as well. Plus its good to meet characters that you can get attached to like Katniss and Peeta. My favorite character in the entire series is Finnick Odair and hes introduced in this novel. The Games! The Games in this novel just takes it to a whole new level too. It was scary enough in the first book, but at least Katniss seemed to feel almost at home. She knows woods; she cant hunt and she can take care of herself. Not only is she in the unfamiliar territory of the jungle but the arena also has that clock twist to it, which is awful! A new horror every hour? No thank you! Crazy killer monkeys, jabberjays that sound like your loved ones being tortured and poisonous fog? Its insanity. I think the most important part of this book though is Katniss transformation. She goes from being focused only on herself, her familiy and her own survival which is NOT a bad thing at all to being concerned about so much more. She becomes concerned with Peeta, and Haymitch, and her prep team, and Cinna. She even begins to be concerned about the other tributes, even though theyre trying to kill her. Remember who the real enemy is. Lastly, I think this book has one of the BEST cliffhangers ever. I remember reading it and wanting to throw the book across the room. How could this possibly be happening? What? What?! WHAT? I couldnt handle it. Luckily enough for me, Mockingjay was coming out within a month, and I didnt have to wait too long to find out. But an epic cliffhanger, and they nailed the cliffhanger in the movie, just an FYI.
GOD I LOVED THIS BOOK LOVED LOVED this book...... what a start,what a middle and what a flipping end! Anything and everything form Colleen is AMAZING.....I cant wait to write my review so you all can just hear how much I love it and how much you will too!! : I think this is one of the few books that I cried more then once in and I love that about a book and its the most tabbed book I have ever read as well!.........Ugh when is it time to PIMP this book... LOL Be back with more!! HUGE book hangover and I LOVE IT.. I still think about this book over a month later!! 3 3 3  So let me add a little more to my review because I think it deserves more! LOL Ok I only have ONE thing I was not happy about with this book and thats something I am not sure I can say much about because it will give away the twist in this one! But if you have read it I did not like how she gave up so easy and did not tell that person, NO thanks I got this and figured it out. I did when I was in that same situation. But to each their own. Besides that everything about this book was amazing from the prologue that had you baling like a baby and pull at your heart to catch a breath to the end, like the last page!

That could be fate, you know Preorder this bad boy....Amazon:  BN: Promise its worth more then they are selling it for!! :D
3.5 out of 5 stars As seen on Impression Blend My relationship with fairy tale retellings as well as YA books in general lately has been a rocky one, but Im happy to tell you I have hope for the genre again. Cinder is a science fiction retelling of Cinderella, in which the main character is a cyborg and a mechanic. It takes place in New Beijing, while the country is being ravaged by a plague for which there is no cure. The book has the standard Cinderella elements: the mean stepmother, two stepsisters, a prince, a ball, and some romance. However, there are plenty of unique addictions as well, which made this book very interesting to read for me. First of all, I was very intrigued by the Lunarspeople living on the moon, most of whom possess special powers, ruled by an evil queen. I thought they were a really interesting addition, and I cant wait to find out more about them. The flip side of this is that I thought there wasnt enough about the Lunars and what their deal was, which is probably something that will get discussed more in the other books in the series, but at this point I was definitely left wishing for more information. Second, while were on the topic of wishing for more information, I really wanted the author to go further into the discussion of who Cinder is. Does she have artificial intelligence? Is she human? How much of her being a cyborg and her brain wiring actually effect her personality, emotions, and feelings? How much programming is involved since we know there is some? All of these questions were left unanswered, and I thought there could be a very interesting discussion had there. Something that I really appreciated about Cinder was that not everyone in the family was mean to the main character. First of all, one of the stepsisters was very friendly and kind, which I thought was a great change from the original story. I also loved IkoCinders android friend, she was adorable. Something I was pleasantly surprised by was Kai, the prince in this story. I always thought that the Cinderella prince lacked any kind of development and personality, and Kai is a huge improvementhes an actual human being, hes pretty relatable, and his character development is interesting to follow. Im actually excited to see what his life will be like after this book! My biggest issue with Cinder was its predictability. Of course, a fairy tale retelling comes with a certain level of predictability, but this was on a whole different level. Every plot twist was obvious way before it actually happened, and like most people I was able to predict how things were going to go down very early on. This is ultimately what made me take the rating down from 4 to 3.5 stars, because despite the faults I still really enjoyed Cinder, and I burned through it pretty quickly. Overall, I think this is definitely a book worth reading, and I will be continuing with The Lunar Chronicles series very soon I already bought the next two books. I hope the rest of the series is just as fun, but a little less predictable, because this scifi setting is really working for me.
All the hype that weve seen for this book for the last couple of months has totally lived up to all that I expected. It Ends With Us is clearly one of the much awaited, most anticipated books of the entire year, not only from the author alone, but from the entire book universe. And guess whatit definitely warrants those titles. I dove into this book ready, prepared and knowing that my heart will suffer and swell again just like any other books of Colleen Hoover that Ive read in the past. But this one is quite different. It holds a more realistic and very empowering side to it that would knock you sideways and pull at your heartstrings even more. So here I am, yet again, still staring at the ceiling, letting everything I just read sink in to me. To say that this story is beautifully heartbreaking would be a vast understatement. And thats not even over exaggerating it. It deserves a much bigger and bolder word to perfectly encompass how much this book has affected me. This story drove a knife straight through my heart, twisted it, pulled it back out and then patched it up with all the bandaids in the world. The neurosurgeon, the florist and the homeless boythese three have taken me to heights Im not sure I ever want to get down from. But thats all youll get from me about the story. Theres no discussing or even giving an overview because I want you to experience this book the way I didwithout any spoilers, mostly blind and fully eager to navigate my own way through until the end. I laughed and smiled as much as I cried and had my heart in a tangled mess of shattered and jagged pieces. There couldnt have been a better ending than that. I loved where and how the story went. It was hard and painful, yes, but isnt that what life really is all about though? That in the end, after everything you go through, you still get even the tiniest of rewards that could repaint that smile on your face even in the slightest? That days arent always dark and gloomy, but it also passes and a better, brighter day comes along? This book is just about LIFE and LOVE and so much more. I couldnt put to words enough how much this book changed me. Theres just no way and this is the best I can do without throwing in any spoilers. Want to hear a naked truth, Colleen? Your author note in the end actually made sob even harder, spill even more tears compared to the whole book. I needed that. It was so heartfelt and absolutely moving. Thank you. My heart will never be the same. I want to have that same strength and willpower that you have. I want to be you when I grow up.
An Advanced readers copy was provided in return for an honest review This book is going to get tongues wagging everywhere it goes. A female psychopath with a taste for young boys was certainly a brave subject to base a debut novel on. In a similar style to The End of Alice by A.M Holmes Alissa takes us inside the mind of a sexual predator. When I got into this book I remember thinking They had sex....so what. Then I realised that it was my reaction to the situation is what was really shocking. Would I be saying the same If it had been a male teacher seducing a young female? I doubt it. I would have been utterly disgusted as I was when reading The End of Alice. When a boy loses his virginity its seen as milestone in life, something to celebrate no matter when it happens. A girls virginity is treated as a fragile gem, only to be given up to the most worthy in only a certain set of circumstances mainly her being of legal age. I was bikini clad, lounging on the hood of a spots car, my blond hair fanned back in the wind. If you were a teenage male, the commentator began, pointing a leering finger back at the photo, would you call a sexual experience with her abuse? I stopped and read that scentence at least 4 times and I have to admit that if I asked any young male I know the same question, the answer would be No. So then does it come down to age and looks? If Celeste had been an older less attractive woman would it be considered abuse? I guess it really comes down to consent, but even thats not straight forward. Was he sorry that it happened? His smile said it all. Had he enjoyed our time together? Before an objection could even be made. hed already begun nodding enthusiastically. If you enjoy something and willingly consent to it, can it be called abuse? Again in this situation I would say no. Again if the roles were reversed would I have the same opinion? If it were a girl I would more than likely say shes so young, she didnt know what she was doing. He should have known better. Because he is male it makes his decisions automatically valid. These are the opinions of a twenty something female. I can imagine the mother of a young teen boy will have a much sharper, more negative opinion. This is why I look forward to reading other reviews on this book. Opinions will certainly be diverse.
I absolutely loved the My True Love Gave to Me collection of holiday stories, but this one seemed really depressing in comparison. Too many stories were about getting over breakups, death, depression, andor lives that were falling apart. Not really the fluffy, lighthearted summer read I was expecting. There was also a weird amount of carnivals  demons? Anyways, my average rating was around a 3, but there were a few stories that really stood out! Heres the breakdown: Head, Scales, Tongue, Tail by Leigh Bardugo: 5 stars This had such an awesome creepy fairy tale feeling to it  I just love everything Leigh Bardugo writes. Id love for this to be a full novel or a movie! The End of Love by Nina LaCour: 4 stars A short, sweet romance that really worked. Last Stand at the Cinegore by Libba Bray: 3 stars Went in a really odd direction. Horror movies arent really my thing, so I wasnt too into it. But it was still well written! Sick Pleasure by Francesca Lia Block: 1 star Boring, incredibly depressing, and didnt read easily. In Ninety Minutes Turn North by Stephanie Perkins: 3.5 stars I LOVED Marigold and Norths story in the last book, so it was mostly just fun to see these characters again. But most of the story was a bit depressing and unclear about why they had even broken up in the first place. Souvenirs by Tim Federle: 1.5 stars Kind of annoying... didnt really get into it or like the characters very much. And I also hate when characters with food allergies end their storygrowth by deciding to take the risk of eating that food because theyve decided to finally live. Like no... it does not work like that. Were not restricting ourselves because were afraid to live. Kind of the opposite. Ugh Inertia by Veronica Roth: 3.5 stars I didnt really connect with the characters, but this one really stood out for its super creative concept. It had kind of a scifi feeling that could easily fit into a longer dystopian book. Love is the Last Resort by Jon Skovron: 2.5 stars I loved the resort setting and how many characters there were, but was this like a retelling of something I didnt catch or why did was the dialogue so awkward? Good Luck and Farewell by Brandy Colbert: 2.5 stars This one was another pretty depressing story, but yay for the diversity. Brand New Attraction by Cassandra Clare: 1.5 stars The setting was ok, but the rest was boring  weird. Also, WHAT IS WITH THIS AUTHORS FIXATION ON BORDERLINEINCEST INSTALOVE?! Oh, and demons? A Thousand Ways this Could All Go Wrong by Jennifer E. Smith: 5 stars This one was definitely my favorite!! The romance actually worked, everything was cute, and I loved the characters. Its nice to see more realistic representations of autism too. This was the main one I really wished couldve been a full novel. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things by Lev Grossman: 5 stars Ok this one was seriously awesome. The day keeps repeating itself so these 2 characters go around making a map of all the perfect things that they can return to each day like a cool cloud, a bird catching a fish, etc. Really uplifting, unique, and weirdly inspirational.
WARNING: This review will be full of gushing and nothing but admiration for this book and for Angie Thomas. There isnt a single thing I didnt absolutely love about this book and Im not afraid to share it. Well, thats not true actually, I do hate that there is a reason we need books like this in our lives and in the hands of our young adults. I hate that there is a reason for us to still be shoving tolerance down everyones throat like it isnt something that comes naturally as part of being a human. I hate that even though this book is fiction there are still people being treated this exact way, and people are dying. But I love Angie for being the amazing human she is and writing this book that I hope is read worldwide and people truly listen to the story and grow from it. Okay, now Ill get to the review part. This. Book. I cannot stress this enough. This book is nothing short of amazing. It is intelligent and important. Witty and painful. There is a darkness inside this book but there is also so much light. Starrs pain is heavy, and its so easy to feel through Angies writing. But its not just Starrs story, its a story that we all need to read, to hear, to witness, and most importantly its a story we need to learn from. I am always trying to do the right thing and I truly believe the most important thing I can do is listen and offer empathy. Im constantly learning how to be a better human, and this book taught me so much while also solidifying beliefs I already have. Heaviness aside, because this book will make it feel like there is a truck parked on your chest, this book is also full of all the things we love about YA contemporary fiction. Theres all kinds of pop culture references, friendship, love, loss, heartbreak, togetherness, nostalgia, and yes even some humor thrown in. Starrs relationship with her friends at her private school is dramatic and her relationship with her boyfriend Chris is totally cute. So its not just a 400 page book about protests and riots, which Im afraid some people might think it will be, there is so much to love about this book that the only way I can prove that to you is by encouraging you to pick it up! This book is so important. Its on a long list of important books sprouting up in todays YA world, and I hope hope hope these books are getting into the hands of teens who really need them. I hope THUG can teach people empathy while also giving others like Starr a story to relate and reflect upon. I know we still have a long way to go, but the people I surround myself with on social media in the book world, and in real life, are advocates for diversity in books, tv, movies, and life in general. I know Im super naive at times, but I just cant understand why Im 2017 we are still having these issues. People are people, and we should love each other because we are all in this world together. The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas hits shelves on February 28th. 11 MORE DAYS! Dont miss out on this one, I promise you wont regret it!
Edit: This is how I imagine Tucker  Favourite Quote: He seems to gaze right into me, like hes seeing me for who I truly am. And in that moment, I want to tell him the truth. Crazy, I know. Stupid. Wrong. I try to take a step back, but my foot slips and I almost go headfirst into the river but he catches me. Wow! Surprisingly I loved it! I have been having a bad run with angel books lately. But this is exactly what I have been looking for. Unearthly has an original plot, interesting characters, swoon worthy crush and overall is a pleasure to read. Cynthia Hands writing was just easy to read. Before I knew it I had read 300 pages. The plot wasnt filled with action but rather mystery. Never did venture down the predictable path. This is probably the most interesting angel concept I have read. There was a little bit of good angel vs fallen angel but for a change it didnt have anything to do with the love interests. The vision and purpose element is what made this so different. Sometimes with angel concepts the history can be complex and hard to understand but this was effortless to follow. Now to my favourite part of this book, the characters and that is what drives this story. Clara is sweet, sometimes funny, believable and made smart choices. Tucker swoons, sorry but every time he is mentioned that happens is a crush worthy male character. A true gentleman, witty, gorgeous, and a cowboy swoons again sorry I am in lurve again. I adored the playful banter aka flirting between Clara and Tucker swoons, it provided plenty of awwww moments. Christian, well he was okay. At first I thought I knew his type  typical, popular, gorgeous, nice guy that every girl is crushing on but in the end was more than I expected. I know that I have just mentioned two guys so therefore it equals love triangle but do not fear. This love triangle was subtle although I do think that it might be brewing for the next book. Clara is pretty certain of her choice and doesnt go back and forth. The ending, no cliffhanger here, yay! There are a few questions but it ends in the right place for more but still leaving readers satisfied. Overall, I highly recommend this book, it had all the right elements. An outstanding debut. Thanks to Netgalley and HarperTeen for providing me with a copy. I have already preordered my own copy.
 spoiler alert  Let me first say that I chose to read this book despite the controversy surrounding Lees willingness for it to be published. Its possible that she never intended for us to see this book, but I wasnt going to deprive myself of the chance to experience more of her brilliance simply because she may or may not have desired its publication. If Margaret Atwood left the novel she intends to be published 100 years from now in my keeping with a stern warning to respect her wishes...I wouldnt. Im sorry, but Im a greedy reader. Though I usually take forever to finish a book, I read this one at breakneck speed, partially because I could not put it down, and partially because I wanted to form my own opinions about it instead of depending on critics and bloggers to tell me what to think. From the reviews Ive since read, most people are reluctant to accept this book because of the new revelations about Atticuss character. We all love Atticus Finch, and its hard to think of him as anything but the embodiment of social justice. However, thats the entire point; sometimes heroes subscribe to terrible ideology, and its important that we acknowledge that men, no matter how great, cannot be looked to for infallible judgment. We must be our own watchmen and not blindly take for gospel the word of those we idolize. Many of the reviews that I have come across seem to dismiss the novel due to some vague fear that it has a racist message. I can admit that while reading, I sometimes questioned in which direction the story was heading. This novel is more complex than its predecessor, and its message is a harder pill to swallow. Instead of a black and white fable to indicate right from wrong, this work tells us that men can be both good and evil by degrees, and that we cannot dismiss them based on their faulty morality. Instead, we have to find a way to live with them. We can struggle with them, and we can disagree with them, but if we run from them, what progress will they make? When To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960, the nation was not ready for its message, which is why it was so important. 55 years later, and Harper Lee is still educating us about tolerance, and just as before, we may not be ready for her wisdom. In 2015, with prejudiced authority figures, ignorant culture preservationists, and elitists who enjoy special privileges while being blithely unaware that the scales are tipped in their favor, its easy to wish we could wash our hands of the lot of them and have done. Yet, Lees newly revealed manuscript calls us to an even tougher mission than its prequel did. Instead of simply confronting and naming injustice, Lee asks us to bear it, to educate against it, to love those who perpetrate it, but above all things, she asks us not to run away, and to always, always stay in the fight.
5 stars for Butch and Vishous, true? They made this book for me. To be honest, they saved this book from being a 3 stars. When I first started this one, I was excited for Butchs story. I didnt really like him in the first book but he grew on me in book 2  3. I had no idea what to expect except from what I read in the synopsis. Butch was going to be in some major life or death trouble, and Marissa was needed to help bring him back. What transpired among Butch, the Brotherhood, the lessers TOTALLY. BLEW. MY. MIND. Didnt even see that one coming. Butch and Vishous... MY BOYS!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM. There was such a deep bond between them and we get to find out why. Heck, their connection was stronger than what I felt between Butch and Marissa. Marissa, on the other hand... not so much. Shes the only heroine so far in this series that I didnt feel a connection to or relate to. She got some issues and insecurities, which is fine but I felt like she held Butch back too often. And I hated that she made him hurt and doubt his worthiness of her. I was frustrated with her for the first twothirds of the book and was only able to tolerate her for the last part, only because Butch loves her! I still think he deserves better. Butch, though, is one of a kind. Not only is he part of the Brotherhood, hes also the only HUMAN male accepted into the vampire world. Butch had always felt like hes drifting along in his world. There was nothing to live for. He did whatever he wanted as a cop but there was no purpose to it. Until he fallen into the vampire world where he felt like he belonged but didnt know why. And as the book progresses, theres more to him that makes him special as more things get revealed. I like to be a participant in a book, trying to guess and foreshadow certain pieces. With this one, I stopped trying to predict whats going on and just went along for the ride. And what a ride it was! Even to the end, it was one bombshell after another. My jaw dropped and loud gasps happened on several occasions. Now Im going to jump right into Vishouss book. I hope I can root for his romance more.
Okay I am totally addicted to this series and this author. Onyx is the second book in the Lux Series and brings not only more Daemon Black but also explosive butt kicking alien mojo. New characters are introduced, more questions arise, strange unexplainable things start happening to Katy and you are inexplicably hooked once again. I am usually a huge fan of books where the male lead tries to win the girl over and this was no exception. The way this is portrayed in this novel fills you with the warm and fuzzies and doesnt turn the novel into a tedious love fest. I always liked you. From the moment you first flipped me off. Im not sure if I can fault any part of this book. Those seeds of doubt are planted in the plot but you still dont see the big twists coming until they smack you in the face. The main characters suffer some emotionally crippling loses but also gain something they have been chasing and mourning more than anything else. You receive closure and its really beautiful. As the reader, you watch this all unfold and you feel as though you are part of the alien clan pack group? Thats the funny thing about trying to escape. You never really can. Maybe temporarily, but not completely. The ending to Onyx is a total cliff hanger, yes I am warning you! It completely knocks you over. The ending builds up to something amazing, rips it away from you and stealthily places it back within reach. I love how the relationship between Katy and Daemon has developed and whilst it is this epic forbidden love, you can just sense how extraordinary their feelings are for each other. Daemon pressed his forehead against mine.Oh, I still want to strangle you. But Im insane. Youre crazy. Maybe thats why. We just make crazy together. As Katy changes and morphs into the unknown, I couldnt help but cheer for both Daemon and Katys relationship and cross my fingers and toes for them. This novel sees them overcome some massive obstacles and battle with rampant jealousy from both past and new characters. This novel sees us delving further into the Luxen world and understanding their powers, the other dangerous forces and of course, more action from the evil aliens. The more that is uncovered the more you get addicted to the story. Air punched out of my lungs. I held her tight, and I knew right then I would burn down the whole universe for her if I had to. I would do anything to keep her safe. Kill. Heal. Die. Anything. Because she was my everything. Opal is the next book in this series. The epic cliff hanger in this book has left me no choice but to carry on. Who am I kidding, Im super excited to carry on with this series. Review on Confessions of a Book Blogger!
Every once and a while, a book garners such commercial and critical acclaim that it becomes a kind of phenomena. Since its release, I have heard nothing but praise for The Help. As is often the case, I put the book on my list of books to read, and there it has sat. With the movie adaptation of the novel receiving award recognition, I finally got my hands on a copy of the book and decided to see what all the talk was about. The story opens with a narrative by Aiblileen, a black maid maid working for a young, white family in Jackson, Mississippi, 1962. She carries a sense of wisdom, as she raises the young daughter of the family, her seventeenth white baby. Despite the loss of her son, he couldnt get the proper care in the colored hospital, Aibileen finds a kind of solace through her job, her faith, and her best friend Minny. Minny is also a maid. While she is praised for her cooking skills, her sassy mouth has gotten her in trouble with previous employers, and finds her with no job and a husband who beats her regularly. Eugenia Phealan, Skeeter, is a fresh out of college, 22 year old white woman, who has returned home, to her mothers dismay, without a husband. We learn that Skeeter has always had trouble fitting in with what society, and her mother, expect of her. Upon her return home, she is shocked to learn that the maid who raised her, Constantine, has left the family home, and no one seems to want to tell Skeeter what happened to her. Saddened by the loss of her childhood companion and eager to get a job at a big publishing company, Skeeter decides to write something important. After a chance encounter with Aibileen, Skeeter enlists her and her friends to tell their stories of being, The Help to white families. I found this to be an unputdownable read, that perfectly mixed lighthearted fiction with the horrors of racism in the south during the 1960s. It is fascinating to read about three strong women who are forced to deal with problems that, unfortunately, many can still relate to today. By relaying the story of each main character through their perspective, Stockett provides beautifully imagined insight into the minds of these progressive women. In knowing the history of this time period and the violence it entailed, there was and underlying sense of suspense throughout the entire story. A kind of To Kill A Mocking Bird for modern audiences, The Help is a book that demands to be read by all.
4.5 stars You cant see a song. You feel a song, you hear a song, you move to it. Just like I cant see you, but I feel you, and I move toward you. When youre with me, I feel like I glimpse a David nobody else knows is there. Its the Song of David, and nobody else can hear it but me. I finished reading this book at 3AM and was crying like a baby. It doesnt take much to get me tearyeyed but some books just make me ugly cry like crazy!! This book was one of them. I did the same with The Law of Moses! Hes the yes. Im the heart. Hes the hands, and Im the head. The writing in this book is different than I am used to. Its told from David and Moses POV. David is telling his story and how he met and fell in love with Millie. It was beautiful and heartbreaking to see how David was struggling with certain things. Moses played a big role in this book and we saw a lot of his POV which I loved. Moses is one of my favorite characters EVER and just loved reading about him and seeing what he was up to. Whenever ou start feeling trapped or helpless, just close your eyes, and you have more space than youll ever need. Millie was such a great character. I loved how her relationship developed with David over time. They started as friends and became more. They both complemented each other. I thought they were the perfect couple. They both grew as individuals and as a couple. I also adored Millies younger brother Henry, he added something special to the story. I enjoyed David and Henrys conversations, a couple of them were funny while others were heartbreaking and sad. The most intimate thing we can do is to allow the people we love most to see us at our worst. At our lowest. At our weakest. True intimacy happens when nothing is perfect. I appreciate the way Amy ended this book. I am so glad she decided to write Davids story because he deserved it to be told. Moses and Davids friendship is one of a kind and so beautiful, theyve been through so much. If you are looking for a very emotional tearjerker then look no further because you found it!
Originally read an advance readers copy in December 2014 Reread in May 16May24, 2015 This book was still as fantastic the second time around as it was the first. It still holds up, and when I reread it a third time later on when the sequel is about to come out, I have a feeling its going to age like a fiiiiine wine. The hype for this book is huge right now, and obviously Im not helping by just adding my review talking about how great it is. Im not sorry. The world building that Sabaa Tahir does is fantastic. This is a very beautifully written book, and I could see scenes play out so clearly in my head. I would pause and reread many passages just for the way that things were described. There was at least one scene that stuck out to me as being incomplete, where a character is on a ledge, her means of getting back down crashes to the ground, and then another character comes out, sees the first character up high, gapes, then leaves. How does she get back down?? I dont know. Unless Ive misread it, then someone please correct me! If you want to see a friendship between a boy and a girl done well, look no further than Elias and Helene. Okay, so they do circle around the idea of romance between the two, but there is a clear and strongly founded comradery between the two. Its friendship first and friendship last, but what happens in the grey zone is for you to find out as you read! Make no mistake though, this book isnt all about the romance. Any element of romance comes second to the main plot lines. It is neither gratuitously unnecessary, nor fundamentally important, but just an added layer that makes for a wellrounded story. Trigger warning: Rape  Right now, theres also an interesting conversation in the fiction community about the inclusion of rape and sexism into high fantasy books. While none of the MCs in this book get raped, there are some close calls, and the threat of it is always present. Where do I stand on this? I think for the world of EMBER it works. I believe the problem arises when rape is clearly done and not discussed further or even considered rape, or when rape is done for the significant catalyst of a characters development. Because then, the message can be seen as being something like: without the rape, this character would have never gotten from A to B in their arc. In EMBER, it is this hovering constant threat for the female characters and I think that speaks to what its like to be a girl out in our world, and have that in the back of our minds. Thoughts on this? All in all, I love this book. Absolutely and whole heartedly, and I cant wait to dive back into the world once the sequel is written!
4.5 Stars Originally posted on www.upallnightbookblog.com In Searching for Moore, I was instantly caught up in Schooners and Mias story and after the way SFM ended I was definitely in need of Moore to Lose to take me off that cliff that I was left on. I love Julies writing style and found myself again completely involved with Mia and Schooner in Moore to Lose. After SFM, I was ready to jump headfirst into the next chapter of Mia and Schooner. I fully expected Moore to Lose to be that but really, it was so much more than that. It was Mias story. In my mind, its the perfect transition between book 1 and what I fully anticipate hope? will happen in book 3. Julie shows us all that Mia goes through from the time she leaves Schooner at college until they meet again. As difficult as it may be to see Mias life and those she surrounds herself with after leaving Schooner, those were moment of growth and learning. Mia is hanging on by a thread and hasnt really dealt with some of her issues from book 1. Moore to Lose is an opportunity to see her grow and come to terms with all that has happened. As someone that is similar in age to Mia when she and Schooner reconnect, MTL was real and emotional and reminded me how all those who are part of our lives make an impact. A few of those people in MTL were Seth, Tom, and Michael. I wont spoil anything but there is one part of this story that hit me very hard and had me sobbing for Mia dammit  doing it again even thinking about it!. Julie Richman knows how to touch on a spectrum of emotions and her character development is spot on as we see Mias growth. I was quite a bit frustrated with Schooner throughout part of this book so Ill be impatiently waiting to see what happens in book 3. Overall, I was immediately drawn in to Moore to Lose and found myself finishing in 2 sittings not 1 because I couldnt keep the eyes open any more!. Julie Richman delivered a book that had my feelings right at the surface and Ill certainly jump on book 3 the moment its available! Oh, yeah, theres a slight cliff on this one too... Copy provided by author for honest review.
While Im gone, dream me the world. Something new for every night. I feel like I just woke up from a dream. Slightly disoriented, like I cant separate reality from fiction. Like I cant remember the exact context of this bizarre dream but I can recollect scattered images and emotions. Bliss. Anger. Agony. Pain. Love. For this series and its raw, complicated and real characters. It was mint and memories and the past and the future and she felt as if shed done this before and already she longed to do it again. The Dream Thieves is more focused on Ronans history, his past, his secrets and his terrifying ability of pulling things out of his dreams. At the same time, Adam struggles to come to terms with the sacrifice he made, Gansey continues his relentless search of the long dead Welsh king and Blue realizes that heart is a traitorous thing and you cant choose who you fall in love with. When a mysterious man appears and stranger paranormal activity strikes their little town, Blue and her raven boys must solve the riddles of their abilities and the ley lines and discover what theyre looking for before it is too late. Before someone else does. All of us have secrets in our lives. Were keepers or keptfrom, players or played. Secrets and cockroaches  thats what will be left at the end of it all. I loved The Dream Thieves, but not as much as The Raven Boys. I was overwhelmed with a constant restlessness, I almost skipped sentences and pages because I wanted something more, something else to happen but I cant pinpoint what that was. Perhaps I got tired from the frequent switch between dreams and reality, and I ended up a tad unsatisfied. In that moment, Blue was a little in love with all of them. Their magic. Their quest. Their awfulness and strangeness. Her raven boys. Despite this uneasy feeling though, Maggie Stiefvaters writing didnt lose its mystical and seductive touch. This books greatest asset was that it explored more thoroughly the relationships between the characters and their personalities, their inner battles and desires and needs. It explained Ronans hatred against the world, it uncovered the secrets he safeguarded for so long and I fell for his wounded, more vulnerable side. Adam on the contrary became more unpredictable. I cant shake the notion that he is jealous of Gansey and thats the source of his bitterness. He is changing, I can see that hes changing and I hope that hell understand how awful he has been to Gansey who only wanted to help him. My sweet, dear Gansey, whose wilder, boyish side is equally intriguing with his scholarly one. I wish you could be kissed, Jane, he said. Because I would beg just one off you. Under all this. He flailed an arm toward the stars. There is no doubt my love, their love will hurt. But their connection, their stolen moments, the longing, they made my toes curl and my heart beat rapidly, sending warmth to every single cell of my body. I am scared and excited at the same time, but I hope, hope, hope. Rex corvus. Parate regis corvi. The Raven Cycle is a bewitching tale, and Im off to start Blue Lily, Lily Blue, because staying away from Blue and her raven boys is impossible. When I end this series, Ill probably need therapy.
This review will also appear on A Leisure Moment Area motherfreaking 51. I didnt know if I should laugh or cry. Just when I thought all things might work out for once, the Luxens and hybrids attempt at rescuing Beth and Chris from Daedaluss secret facility proved futile. Daemon and Katy being together is an important aspect to this series, but at the beginning of Origin, they werent together. Katy was stuck with Daedalus, while Daemon was doing whatever he had to do to rescue her. Whats the plus side, you ask because there is one? Origin is told in dual perspective! Getting inside Daemons head might have been the best part about this book. Up until this point, Katy had always been the sole narrator, but without Daemons side of things, I wouldnt have known how hard he worked to get to her. If youve read Opalwhich I recommend reading before Origin and after Obsidian and OnyxDaemon not being able to express his feeling verbally played as an underlying, mundane issue. Instead of having to wait for him to announce his undying love for Katybecause, I mean, really?I knew it before she did. Well, not all of the time, but Daemons character, as well as his unique personality, came to the forefront of things. I had a fear that the first half of the book would be a waiting area, possible like in New Moon when Bella was waiting on Edward, because thats all she did was wait. Katy Swartz, while she was waiting for someone to come rescue her, kept thinking positively, even in the worst situations. Thats not to say all of her thoughts were about beautiful sunsets and happyeverafters; she was practical, too. Her characters development rested highly on whether or not she still had some good left in her after all of the things that she had done, things such as killing and not being too kind about it. Without someone there to define that gray areas, she had to rely on what she knew to be true when she didnt know if she could be trusted. Its impossible to talk about these books without talking about the steamy bits between Daemon and Katy, but Origin shifted their relationship. Since the bond, there was a deeper connection, albeit the initial attraction the one Daemon had to convince Katy of was still there. In the first three books, they dont go long without seeing or being near one anotherthey are neighbors, after all. Going without each other was part of it, but going without that deep connection with someone that understood them was another. They arent contingent, per se, but they do make up two halves of a whole. Katy can hold her own without Daemon, but you know what they saytwo are better than one. Throughout this series, Ive enjoyed figuring out what the titles meant. Obsidian for the weapon against the Arum; Onyx for the Luxens weakness; and Opal for the thing that increases a Luxens power. Discovering why Armentrout titled the book Origin kept me on my toes, and once I knewyeah, I didnt really know what to say. Start this series. If youve already read it, go you! I understand why Ive heard about it for a long, long, long time. Ive finally discovered the world of Daemon Black and the Luxen, and I love it.
5 rating. First and foremost I am grateful. Grateful to find out that I am not the cynical snobreader I thought I was turning into, who couldnt feel a flicker of emotion through the past dozen books prior to this one. It was just the wrong books. Most young adult books out there are not worth reading and if you do not care about the characters  not even if they live or die  its probably not due to a personality fault in you. This novel is an entirely different category. This book deserves a place in my hall of hallowed books. Its a very long hall with very few books. Of the thousands of books I have read far more than are registered on goodreads maybe two dozen books are shelved here and the fault in our stars is the latest addition. I cannot do this book the justice it deserves with a review  my words are measly by its lofty standard  but I will try. I loved this book, I loved the characters and I bawled my eyes out for at least half of it. I have never read a book that deals so gently and profoundly with mortality. Memento mori. Except wed rather not. Every human would prefer to think theyre immortal, that there will never be a time when oblivion and nonexistence stands before our door. Its particularly unfair when that time comes before youve really had a chance to live, as is the case with the main character in this book. Hazel, age 16, terminal stage IV cancer. I wont give a synopsis  there is so little I could say without revealing spoilers. However, Hazel is forced to a cancer support group and there she meets someone new  a gorgeous, handsome teenage boy  Augustus  who cant stop staring at her. Their story is not at all predictable. If you give a damn about fictional characters, if words come to life for you  then read this book. Forget cancer and teenage love. That is not what this book is about. It is about life. Love, yes  but not puppy love. Our human smallness in the vastness of the universe. Of time, who is a slut that screws us all, to paraphrase a line from the book. Read it. There never was a story that deserved to be read as much as this one.
It took me a while to write this booktalk, the first book was enthralling which was why I jumped to the first chance of reading the sequel once it came to my knowledge that there was a sequel after all. Honestly I was still very much hooked with Will and Lous story that subconsciously I was hoping for more in this sequel. Well, of course I didnt get that, the past is the past, time doesnt stop there and instead what I got was a story of the ones left behind, clenched with grief and devoid of any strong will to move on after him. It took me a while to actually fall for this book, the smooth and easy writing of the author really helped me a lot in getting by, but still it was not what I wanted to read, but I kept on reading, because of the characters in the book are so familiar and so natural, I can perfectly picture The Clarkes chattering in their cramped house, the friendly bickering, the silly discussion over the essential of leg and underarm shaving to a happy marriage, and Treena mentally slapping Lou for being too much of a drama and rejecting opportunities she wasnt so lucky to get herself. They are such familiar taste, an easy bite! The story opens with Lou losing her purpose over time. Now she had the money and liberty to spread her wings and go places, shes still stuck with shitty jobs and her still mourning heart cursed to him over and over for even slightly thinking that he had given her an opportunity to take on life in a greater scale without him by her side, what a jerk! She cried....Until a fatal accident brought Lou home and with it a bunch of new people walked into her life. Someone from Wills past who decided to show up at her doorstep demanding her right, a therapy group sharing their horrible experience of losing loved ones who did not help much at first and a potential new crush who she simply saw as also a potential new lost... In the end, this is a proper sequel to Me Before You. I enjoyed it and would recommend you to read it if you feel like the first book didnt end as you hoped for. But I wouldnt compare this with the first book, to me it tells an aftermath of a sweet, solid and unforgettable love story of Will and Lou, a decent complement book of recovery.
In short: I felt that Clockwork Princess by Cassandra Clare was the perfect ending to an amazing series and its beloved characters. Overpowering happiness and emotional devastation  is it possible to feel such entirely different emotions over the ending of a series? Because with Clockwork Princess, the final book in one of my most favourite and beloved series, I sure felt that way. Clockwork Princess was a mixed bag of thrills and laughs, anguish and dread. I felt much the same about Clockwork Angel and Clockwork Prince, but Clockwork Princess kicks it up a notch definitely. I could not think of a more perfect outcome and ending for this amazing series and its beloved characters. The same thing that I have always said about Cassandra Clares characters holds true: they are some of the most engaging, endearing, and interesting characters I have come across. Every character, whether main or side, has their own unique personality and backstory and I have SUCH fondness for them all! Which makes it all the worse when they inevitably have to deal with ALL THE CRAP as Cassandra Clare systematically goes through each and every one of them and bestows drama and anguish and shite on them all. Cassandra Clare has proven time and time again that she has no problem playing with her readers emotions and I suspect she in fact enjoys seeing us fall madly and deeply in love with her characters only to reduce us to puddles of despair and heartbreak by torturing them. Damn her! Works. Every. Time. How could three people who cared for one another so much cause one another so much pain? pg.175 One of the main sources of this heartbreak is of course the love triangle. But it is a love triangle that actually WORKS. I am still kind of in awe of Cassandra Clares ability to craft a love triangle that does NOT make me want to cut somebody. But there it is: a TRUE love triangle in which everyone involved feels an equal amount of affection and respect for each other and in which no one comes out of the affair looking bad. Something of a rarity for love triangles. And I love that Cassandra Clare gave Will and Jems bromance as much emphasis as she gave to the main romantic relationships. For the first time ever, I feel as though a love triangle has been handled effectively and gracefully. And I am so thankful of that. I dont think Clockwork Princess was technically perfect; I had some minor, passing issues. But what do they matter when this finale affected me so profoundly and emotionally? I was very much saddened to have to say goodbye to this series and its cherished characters though as we have come to expect from Cassandra Clare, this is not necessarily the case. I think Cassandra Clare came up with a practically perfect ending for The Infernal Devices that will hopefully satisfy the majority of readers  it did for me, anyways.
The magic lives on. 19 years later. I was ecstatic when I got my hands on a copy of this book. Ive read this for less than a day. It seemed somehow disconnected with the classic Harry Potter series. It doesnt seem like the 8th book at all. I mean, it isnt, not really. Its a script book for the play of the same name by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, and John Tiffany. But I did love reading it! I wish to see this play live on stage. The old characters are very different. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco  I cant imagine their generation continuing to live like that. Way back when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was finished, I yearned and searched for more details about what happened to the characters after the war. Harry and Ron are supposed to be having a fancy job at the ministry, right? But in this book, Ron took care of the Weasley joke shop. His character was not I expected it to be too. Yes hes funny, but in this book his funny and joking side seemed a little bit overboard. Also, Hermione is the Minister for Magic. Its like everything I believed in back then about the epilogue was shattered. I am Slytherin and theres nothing wrong with Albus Severus Potter being sorted into Slytherin. When Albus was sorted I was so happy, because I was rooting for him to be there. People should know that Slytherin is not the source of evil! Look at Andromeda Tonks nee Black, Shes the mother of Nymphadora Tonks. Shes Slytherin and she has a golden heart. And of course, look at Snape. Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy and Albus Severus Potter! I ship them so hard. SCORBUS! It was so glaringly obvious that they love each other. I love how Scorpius is a bit of a nerd. He loves to read books so much. Hes so sweet. The Scorpion King. Albus Potter seemed like the darker character to me. Who would have thought? I feel a bit sorry for Harry when he was pushed away by his own son. I love to see more of James Sirius and Lily Luna. Scorpius and Rose is a big NO! I dont like that ship at all. And whats up with her name? Rose GrangerWeasley  Shouldnt it be just Rose Weasley? I was so annoyed by her character. I really loved the flow of the story. It is unique. I was again reminded of some of the adventures that took place during the previous Harry Potter books. I loved how they use the expression Thank Dumbledore. The story got retrospectively dark as it goes on to show the flashbacks. I felt so nostalgic after reading this. Its great to be back in the Wizarding World.
Half lost 4.75 non spoiler ... I cant really say that much because this is the three book in the series. But I can say that I was a bit skeptical on how this book was going to end because the book was much smaller than the other but its quality not quantity and quality definitely won in this book. As always I loved Sally Greens writing style and I would definitely recommend this book series to anyone who wants a refreshing read. Im also thinking of doing a whole series review on my blog nonspoiler and spoiler so I will link it here if i post it Spoiler This book starts off with a lot of anger towards Annalise which I loved. I really did need that especially with what went down in the second book. I loved discovering Nathens new powers and just seeing Nathen and Gabriel together in the woods was nice. I did feel like the story was going a bit slow and not really getting to the plot but I might have felt that way because I did read it over a very long period. Now that I think about it I wish I had read it over the span of a week instead of taking an extremely long break from it. I was so happy when Gabriel and Nathen finally got together. The maps on the wall was a really nice scene it felt so magical especially with Gabriel there. I just loved the story itself. The last battle was so intense but the scene with the glass pyramid was great. Im so glad that everyone who I wanted to die died expect for Annalise. But honestly I dont really mind Annalise not dying mainly because Nathen didnt, but at the end Nathens love for Gabriel held a high place in his heart than the hate for Annalise. The ending was so sad. Gabriels death was tragic but it does gives you a perspective of wars and that not everyone survives. We might already know this concept but seeing it effect characters we love just give off another greater perspective. Seeing the PTSD was heart breaking and Nathen imagining Gabriel was so hard, I honestly thought he had survived when Nathen started to talk about him. It was hard seeing Nathen isolate himself but it was for the best. Celias part at the end was so beautiful. I know that most people hated Gabriels death so do I but it really does make this series leave a mark on you, it makes it more unique and I just loved how everything was wrapped up. This book series was so refreshing and it is interesting seeing a main character whos nature is to isolate himself, instead of all the same plot that is used in YA books that are repeated.
Wow so I found this book by reading the jacket on the book in the story. This blurb given there was so cryptic it intrigued me. Now that Ive read it I know why the blurb was so cryptic as this book is hard to make a summary for. It has so much in it. Creatures never seen before, angels, magic, giant puppets, fallen, and war. It had love and hardship, it had friendship and morals, and the meaning of values and how they shape people. Taylor did an incredible job making the characters have internal conflicts. She twisted an amazing tale of love that lasts through the ages even after death. It mixes magic with the ethereal and absolutely entrances you from the very first page. This book is about a girl named Karou who was raised by chimera. She knows shes not ordinary and in the beginning thats all she wants. Her family use peoples teeth to grant wishes and she helps them collect those teeth. When shes not doing that she goes to an art school in Prague where she shows still lifes of Brimstone, Issa, and other chimera but people think are just her imagination. All of that changes when scorched hand prints start showing up a doors all around the world signaling that the war fought between seraphim and chimera for centurys has found its way into their world. Karou is faced with her past and who she really is. She meets a seraphim named Akiva that she feels she knows but just doesnt know how she knows him. He hold the key to her past but if she remembers will she still love him or will that love turn to hatred? She must decide if her love for the enemy or her love for her family is more important. The imagery in this book was spectacular. You felt like you were standing there in Prague or India or where ever. The characters were phenomenally written. The plot was original and intriguing. The world was beautiful and creepy at the same time and Taylor did a great job portraying that. This book and its characters were so unique I honestly had no idea what was going to happen. It was unpredictable and it kept you riveted from the very first sentence. I could not put this book down. The characters were so deep and vivid it was hard not to completely love all of them. Karou is strongwilled, bold, but also has an innocence to her that makes her totally intriguing. She was naive and a little childish but she learned and grew and I loved watching her do it. Her heart was pure, but strong like the heart of a lion and she was not afraid to be herself in all things...most of the time. Akiva was wow. He was so heartbroken and tormented that when he finally finds her again would cant help but rejoice for him. He is standoffish and has a no nonsense attitude but thats what I love about him. I recommend this book for everyone. There were some places that were slow but the imagery and the world made even thoughs parts completely intriguing.
3.5 to 4 stars. Im so glad I read this! I had given up on finding a book similar to The Hunger Games but this came very close. happy sigh. Thank you David for giving me an ebook copy of Moon Dwellers in exchange for an honest review. Hmm, where do I start? Oh, right. Another cliffhanger!! Why?! And just when I had free time too. : I need to get my hands on Star Dwellers. sigh I barely had time to read this but...I made sure to have time to do it. Whether it was during my break or in the middle of the night, I found myself reading it, wanting to know what was going to happen next. The action never ceased to exist in the book so it was interesting although some parts were a teeny weeny bit draggy and then some parts were too short. Other than that, I really enjoyed the book. But I was quite upset because for most of the book, Adele and Tristan werent together so there wasnt much romance and i am a romance book junkie. Although they were constantly thinking about each other. Another thing I like about this book is the switching POVs. Whenever I find out that a book has switching POVs I become super happy because I wont have to figure out whats going on in the other characters head and i can understand both characters more. Although for some books, its better that way. Anyway, I really liked the characters in the book. If a heroine can kick ass, Im all for it because its fun. Its not like books where the heroine is all weak and waits for her knight in shining armour to protect herthe damsel in distress. Not that I dont like those kind of books. I do but for books where theres a lot of action and war going on, I expect the heroine to at least know how to throw a punch or two and not wait for her hero to rescue her. It gets boring when shes just an observer and doing nothing but watch the others fend for her. Luckily, Adele is not one of those dainty heroines who dont like to get their hands dirty. In fact, she actually does a pretty good job at fighting. And she was also not one of those bratty teenage girls. That I am thankful for. Now, I liked Tristan a lot. It was actually funny at times because of him and Roc. I enjoyed reading about their playful banter and was touched by their close bond. Tristan is not one of those snobbish rich dudes whos all I am mighty and youre not worthy so bow before your highness. If he was that kind of character, Id be royally pissed and would probably loathe him which would be a shame considering how much I liked Moon Dwellers. I think this was a good read. Moon Dwellers is a book for people who like action with a dash of romance set in a dystopian place. I would suggest anyone who likes Hunger Games to just give this a try.
Me Before You is centered around the main character of Lou Clark. Lou knows how many footsteps there are from her bus stop to her home and she knows she really enjoys her job working in the Buttered Bun cafe. Lou also knows that she might not really be in love with her long term boyfriend Patrick. What Lou doesnt know is that she is about to lose her job and she likes knowing what is coming. The second character this book is centered around is Will Traynor, who after being involved in a motor cycle accident, has lost his desire to live. Will knows that everything in his life now feels out of his control and everything seems very small and joyless and he wants to put a stop to it. But when Lou comes bursting into Wills life, neither of them will ever be the same. Me Before You surprised me in more than a few ways. Sometimes really hyped books like this I am a bit weary of, however, I have to say that this book is most certainly worth the hype. I am not used to British writing, so that was a nice surprise, although there were a few phrases I had to look up. I really enjoyed the authors writing and I really enjoyed the characters themselves. Lou is very colorful and has her own distinctive personality and I really enjoyed getting to know her. Although she has problems of her own and a past that haunts her at times, she seems to have a cheerful way about her, even if its forced. Wills character is also well developed and I found him to be really funny as well. Both Will and Lous families are both very well developed and I could picture both of their parents and homes very well through the authors descriptions. Patrick, Lous boyfriend, was probably my least favorite character, but I think that is perhaps what the author had in mind. This is one of those books I have a hard time reviewing because there is so much I want to say, but I cant without giving away spoilers, which I never do. This book was not what I expected and it did not end how I expected. I kept trying to guess which way the ending was going to go and I never figured it out until the last chapters. This book made me laugh, it made me smile and it made me cry. I really enjoyed it. After reading the synopsis and reviews for the sequel, After You I dont know that I am going to read it right away. I will someday, but I am afraid it might diminish my feeling for this book. If you havent read this book, I highly recommend you do. And dont you dare go see the movie first or instead of reading the book! Happy reading!
Upon coming across the summary of Side Effects May Vary, I was immediately hooked. I mean, fine, it sounded a little cliched, but the synopsis made Alice sound like a sweet, charming girl who was about to fall for her adorable best friend. I guess I was wrong. Alice was one of the worst heroines I have ever come across. Shes not horrible in the way that others are which is usually because theyre too weak, clingy or just plain annoying, but because she was such a bitch to everyone and used other people to get what she wanted. She was a manipulative, insensitive asshole who didnt deserve all the love and care other people gave her. There were a few times where she redeemed herself like in the ending, but overall I did not appreciate her character and hope not to turn out like her when I grow up. Here is a quote by someone who was talking to Alice: And indeed she was. I wouldve liked it better if Alice were a petty, attentionseeking bitch rather than a heartless and cold manipulator. Oh wait! She was a petty, attentionseeking bitch as well! Which brings me to another problem regarding Alice: she was so friggin moody. One minute, she would cling to Harvey as if he were a magnet and she were a piece of metal, and in the next instant she would be flirting with another guy and completely ignoring Harvey! It was perfect except that she was dying and I was living and I didnt know how we could do both at the same time. Harvey Oh dear, sweet Harvey. I could do nothing the entire book but pity him. He kept chasing after Alice despite knowing that she was only using him. I couldnt even think he was sweet or nice, because all I could think about was how bad I felt for him! If only he were a bit smarter with his choices, then I wouldve really liked Harveys character, since he portrayed the kindbestfriendinlove, which I usually swooned over. The story itself was a bit cliche but rather endearing. A girl with cancer asks her amazing exbest friend to help her fulfill her odd bucket list. The chapters alternated not really between then and now chapters which gave us two perspectives to considerthe time when she was horridly sick, and the time when she was free mostly of her illness. I liked some cute scenes here and there, but nothing was particularly unique about the novel or its premise. If youre a fan of John Green or A.S. King, I would still recommend that you give this one a shot.
Im still mulling over how to rate this book. I finished it in less than 24hours, which speaks to how compelling the story was for me, but Im struggling with this novel as a retelling of 1001 Nights.  In this retelling of Arabian Nights, Shahrzad volunteers to marry the murderous king in order to get close to him to avenge the death of her best friend. To spare her life long enough to find the kings weakness, she tells him stories well into the dawn. As she works to stay her execution, she involuntarily comes to know her new husband and realizes theres much more to the story than just a murderous man using his power to terrorize his people. I stayed up all night reading this! It was so compelling!! The slow characterization was woven into the story, and Shazi was such a strong and interesting character. Ahdieh allowed her readers to experience the conflict Shazi was feeling as she warred between her loyalty to her lost friend and her emerging feelings for her new husband. Rating this as simply a YA fantasy novel, Id give it an enthusiastic four stars maybe five if you asked me after coffee. It was compelling. I loved the characters, particularly the female friendship between Shazi and her handmaiden. The feelings that developed between Shazi and Khalid were very subtly done and in such a way that it was believable that she could develop feelings for her enemy. I do think Ahdieh couldve done much more with the tension Shazi is feeling. There are quite a few moments, specifically when they consummate the marriage that she couldve really focused on what Shazi is thinking and what a sacrifice this is for her. Also, for a girl hellbent on revenge, Shahrzad had no real plan for killing the king, and she had several opportunities. My biggest problem comes in with this story as a reimagining of Arabian Nights. This book really misses the mark when it comes to that fight for her life Scheherazade faces. Its a very intense and empowering, and its really missing in this book. There is a lot of men talking and battling, and very little of that fight albeit in a different way we see in the Scheherazade of the original. The other element missing is the power of storytelling. The storiestosaveherlife theme lasts all of two? nights, which is disappointing because that is one of my favorite parts of the original.
AUDIOBOOK REVIEW: 4,5 STARS I love being a blogger but it sometimes the schedule is between you and the new books you want to read so much. This is what happened with me and Confess. I couldnt squeeze the schedule in order to read or listen to Confess. But, its never to late, right? Confess is a beautiful story about confessions, coincidences, happenstances, and fate. This is the story of Auburn and Owen. Auburn suffered the loss of her boyfriend at a young age and that loss left a mark in her heart, her soul and her life for ever. Five years later shes back in the city where her boyfriend died, and she feels more alone than ever in her life. Thats when she meets Owen. Hes a talented artist who finds inspiration in the confessions of anonymous people who leaves them in his gallery. Just like Auburn, he has a past that has made him build walls to protect himself, and sadly these walls isolate him for everyone. Is it a coincidence that the day Auburn decided to get a new job is the same day that Owen needed help in his gallery? Is it a happenstance that she and only she can make Owen smiles? Is it fate that they both find exactly in each other what they needed to move on from their pasts? I loved Auburn. She loved endlessly and measureless. All of her actions were thinking of what was best for the future of the ones she loved the most, and her only selfish act was exactly what helped her to get what she wanted the most. And I loved Owen the most. He was just amazing. I loved his brain, how he analyzed everything, how he was so selfish one moment but the next he sacrificed himself for the ones he loved. Every time he compared feelings with colors I fell more and more in love with him. Their confessions were so shocking. I never expected them. Not for one second. This was one of the best thing about this book. Its unexpected. Its original. Its unique. The narrations of Elizabeth Louise, Sebastian York were perfect. I have to be honest, after almost 100 hours of listening Elizabeth as Tessa in the After Series Audiobooks, it kinda set my mind to think of Elizabeths voice only for Tessa, but when I was in the 10 of this audiobook I didnt think of Tessa anymore and Elizabeths voice was only Auburn for me. Her voice is as sweet, fragile, strong and determined as Auburn. I was a little worried about Sebastians performance because Owen is in his early twenties and Sebastians voice is for someone in his thirties, but Sebastians narration was PERFECT! I always love Elizabeths and Sebastians voices for the secondary characters, they knows how to put the personalities in their voices.
Yes. YES. YEEEEES. Finally! A book that deals with euthanasiaauthorized suicide! I think I havent come across a book with such complicated matters and that delves into a very sensitive issue this well. I hope for hope that people who will read this book can understand the message of the story. I hope that somehow, this book made people a little bit more open to the issue of mercy killing because as said in the book, an ablebodied person can never wholly understand how difficult it is to live in such a limited way. Being a physiotherapist, myself, I love how well the author was able to give readers a picture of how it really is to live with and care for someone with such a difficult condition such as a spinal cord injury. Everything was on point, even autonomic dysreflexiaa very challenging consequence to having SCI was mention and explained well. There was just one fact that was overlooked about the C1112 spinal cord level of injury which I dont know if it was just some typo or an honest mistake because spinal cord injury in the cervicalC level only reaches up to C8. Anyway, the book was so good. It was intense and somewhat grandiose, given that Will, one of the main characters is extremely welloff financially. And it definitely made his suffering a tiny bit easierfor lack of a better term compared to those who arent that much fortunate, since his family did not have to worry about the costs of his medical requirements. But still, it does not mean that the family did not encounter any troubles and challenges along the way. In this book, we see each characters personalities, the way they cope with things that are burdening them. We see how they grow and change. We see the struggles and pain they had to endure. And what made me love it even better is that we get to see the story in both perspective. We were given the insight of the one with the spinal condition, how he fight against the consequences and effects of his disabilty,and at the same time, we see the views of the people who cares for him, how Wills condition affected them as well. In that way, we see a clear picture of how it truly is to manage disabilities caused by accidents. I only had a bit of a problem with the part of the story where the characters somehow think that just because one is content to live in a comfortable way and not an adventurous one, that its already a boring life. I mean, people are different from each other. You cannot just shove your way of life in their faces, judging them that they are not living their lives as exciting and heartpounding as yours. You cannot pressume that your lifestyle is suitable for everyone. Its so insensitive to tell others that they lived their lives uselessly. Its a matter of choice and opinion. Anyway, I have to reiterate this fact: This is definitely NOT a love story. This is a story of life, of its importance and of how it means for different people to live the way they want. It is such an unforgettable story, one I will treasure for a long time.
A little mermaid retelling with a ff romance? I loved the concept of this book! It was an enjoyable light read that I rushed through because I was eager to see the ending. My biggest criticism of the book and the reason I didnt rate it higher is because I wasnt too big on the writing style and I wished a lot of things were fleshed out more. Ersel, our protagonist, is your typical little mermaid; she collects human objects from sunken ships and dreams of leaving the merfolks fortress and its confining roles for women. Ersels story begins when after a ship crashes into the fortress, she discovers Ragna, the sole survivor. The two quickly become friends and develop into more! as Ersel helps Ragna survive. Problems arrive from Havamals, her best friend, interference and Ersels attempts to bargain with Loki. I must say that for a retelling, I was surprised by some of the twists! Im happy to say that I tried to predict some of the events and was totally wrong. I tend to think that an author is doing a good job when readers arent able to predict twists. Of course the biggest thing I adored about this book was the romance between Ersel  Ragna. Their interactions were cute and charming. I only had one minor issue with it and that was that I felt their relationship got really intimate too quickly towards the end. Now my biggest issue with the book was the writing. I felt that it was too sparse with details. Multiple times a character would speak without being introduced or previously mentioned in a scene. Additionally I felt that a lot of actionsevents were underwritten. I would have to repeatedly go back and reread them because the actions were often written so laconically that I didnt even realize they happened. But when it came to Ersels feelings and inner thoughts, the author told us so much! I felt that these two areas needed a better balance. For such a short book 212 pages I felt that the author did a good job of world building. She slowly released details throughout the story instead of doing a big tell all at the beginning. It was great to see that she thought a lot about the different aspects of the mermaid culture. I really wished that she had fleshed out her characters more though. I wanted to know more of why Havamal joined the Kings guard. I wanted to know more of what happened to Ragna when she wasnt present in the book. I really wanted to see more of the King. The King was such a stereotypical tyrant and one dimension character. Were told hes cruel for a good part of the book but rarely do we see him interact with the characters or do anything. I felt that this weakened the book since his character became so important later on. My overall opinion was that it was a decent read but it needed more layers. I would recommend it if youre looking for a short read and a Little Mermaid retelling though.
Edit: Rereading the book has made me love Gansey a tad bit more than I did before. Actual Review I am guilty of reading this book because of the pretty cover. It took me a while to get to this though because at first I was really excited and then I kept on reading the synopsis again and again until I wasnt whether I should read it or not. I hadnt read any books by Maggie before this and well although people said Shiver was great, it didnt sound like my kind of book I went on to read it later and loved it. So I went into this book really hoping it would be good. I think its the kind of books that captivates you at the beginning and then slowly becomes more interesting. The prologue and the first chapter were both amazing but then after that things became a little slow. In most books I would have given up, but somehow Maggie kept me interested. She slowly revealed its and bits about what was going on and she built on everything. I loved how she focused on the characters, building on their relationships. I loved every single one. I loved Blues relationship with her aunts and with her mother. I loved the friendship between the boys and how they opened up to Blue slowly. I also loved how Maggie explored each individual character. Some may say that Ronan wasnt explored enough but I think she did that on purpose. It plays with the mysteriousness of his character. He is the dark brooding boy and I loved Maggies approach on this kind of character. Ronan is so different from the cliche brooding guys and thats why I love him. Then we also have Gansey. I wish there were more guys like Gansey in modern YA because I loved his determination. I loved how he messed up and he wasnt always sure how to act around people like with Blue in the beginning but he always cared about his friends. Adam. Adam was a rather interesting character because even though most people say he is a sweet boy. He isnt. I love how Maggie makes him seem more real because no one can be completely nice. Everyone has a dark side and so does Adam. Noah the last boy in their group is one of my favorites. I find him cute. How he is always petting Blues hair because it is always messed up. I wish we would get to know a little bit more about him. Now for our female lead Blue, I like her. From the summary you would think that all she did is swoon over the guys. Its actually the last thing she does. She is pretty involved in the whole research and even though there is something going on between her and Adam it isnt focused on because there is something a lot bigger going on. I liked Blues character as well, she was determined and stubborn. I really cannot wait for the next book because even though this book is concluded rather well there are a lot of questions hanging around and I havent even talked about some of the other things going on in this book because well I could go on and on about it. This book is pretty complex and I know that quite a few people have trouble with the slowness of the book but hold on because it is worth it.
Thank the heavens for the day I found my first Taylor Jenkins Reid novel. This one, as well as all her others just burrows right into you. This novel is simple, yet poignant at the same time. Lauren and Ryan have been together for 11 years and they have let the little issues and resentments snowball into a marriage they do not recognize. A marriage they do not enjoy. They decide to go for a year long break, yes they can date around and no they cannot have any contact. The novel does give you progressive scenes from when they meet, and I must say that A. How he goes about asking her out is one of my favorites, seriously swoony! B. I loved that she did those scenes, tiny little moments along the way that were just enough to show you how they got to where they are. And just enough to break your heart that they got to such a point. I enjoyed it I really did yet it lacked the depth I have come to expect from a Reid novel. This almost seemed like a cliff notes version, nearly every scene could have been expanded into more if you ask me just so many things were left out. Or perhaps I am just overly obsessed with Reid and I will simply never be pleased no matter how much she gives me? THE EMAILS KILLED ME He hates me as much as he loves me. I hate these letters as much as I love them. The pain and the joy are locked together, tightly bound. I read the letters over and over again, hoping to separate one from the other, hoping to discern whether love or hate wins out in the end. But its like pulling on the ends of Chinese finger trap. The more I try the tighter they cling to each other. I seriously was flipping through pages at times just to see how much longer I had to read before I got to another email! Those were the most raw parts of this book. Got to all my feelers. Plus its really the only insight we are given into Ryan. A bummer if you ask me this novel could have used a bit more of him. Just such an interesting read, there are so many different perspectives on love and romance. By the time I finished reading I realized it is not possible there is only one right way. The ending has its cheesy moments, it was indeed predictable but neither of these things stopped me from happy tears! Its a cute read, it is definitely an introspective read. Taylor Jenkins Reid has a knack for that, I read her novels and see nooks and craneys in my marriage I didnt know were there before and I quite like that. Isnt it nice ... once youve outgrown the ideas of what life should be and you just enjoy what it is. I wish I was the sort of person who doesnt need her pain to be heard. I want to be the typer of person who can keep it to herself and spare the feelings of others. But in not that person. My anger has to take flight. It has to be set free and allowed to bounce off the walls and into the ears of the person I could hurt the most.
Immediate reaction: Oh my gosh. 1: why didnt I read this sooner. 2: Josh Fucking Bennett 3: I have tears in my eyes 4: I loved this. So much. Originally posted on: Book Scents How do I write this review? This is one of those books that I know Im going to want to reread. Im sitting here, wondering how to put into words how amazing this book was. I feel like nothing I say can adequately express just how much I adored it and how amazing it is. Nastya and Josh. The story is told in their alternating POVs, showing us how each of them have had a pretty tragic past. Well, in Nastyas case, we know something huge happened but dont get the whole story right away. Nastya is a brusque character. She dresses all in black, purposefully dresses inappropriately and turns her Idareyoutosaysomething face to the world. Despite her prickly exterior, I came to LOVE her. Read it and youll understand. Josh. Josh Fucking Bennett. This boy!! Every single person he has loved has been taken away from him. I mean, that alone broke my heart!! He doesnt let that consume him though. He reaches out to Nastya when everything she projects screams for people to leave her be. But its with him that she finds a bit of peace and he sees her underneath the heavy makeup. They find solace in his garage as he makes beautiful furniture and wood pieces and Nastya helps him sand. It sounds boring but no! Every single thing they do is written so well and each time theyre together is amazing. Josh has so many awesome quotes that I adored and I dog earred that book to death. I never used to be a dog earer but when my emotions overwhelm me, dogearring happens. I really dont know how to put into words how much I loved these two and seeing them together. There are books when the writing is so beautiful and brilliant that the characters come to life and this is one of them. Even the secondary characters are amazing and I LOVED them too. Drew made me laugh so much and Clay  a minor character and yet just as real as the main ones! In Short... I may be the last person ever to finally read this but if Im not  dont be like me. Dont wait. Go. Buy. Read. The Sea of Tranquility is an achingly beautiful story about two people with tragic pasts that come together and start to heal. This book made me laugh but it also broke my heart. It pulled me in and it branded these characters onto my heart. And the ending? The ABSOLUTE best. I cried. And I loved it. Read it, read it, read it!
I kept waiting for this book to get annoying or repetitive but it only got better as it went along. Sydney wasnt happy, even though she couldnt complain. She had a caring boyfriend hunter and best friend for a roommate Tori , but all that changes when she finds out that Hunter has been cheating on her with Tori, the whole time. Broken hearted and to embarrassed to call her parents she has no where to go, until her neighbor offers her a place to stay. But of course it couldnt just be ANY neighbor! It had to be a hot guitar playing neighbor, who also happens to have a girlfriend dramaaa . Right about now theres a HUGE plot twist which basically changes the entire book and actually makes it worth reading. There were some serious issues with this book thought. Like the Prologue really had no business being there, it served no purpose other than to confuse us. Not too mention the freaking repetition, when I got about halfway through I was just passing pages because it was the same sappy crap over and over. Also Ridge has a brother called Brennan who he talks about frequently but we never get to actually meet him for more than 2 sentences. But it also had a bunch of amazing things likeee its own soundtrack! We actually get to hear the songs Ridge and Sydney are creating which makes it so special. The characters are likable, like Ridges roommates Warren and Bridgette. They were both sassy and full of snide remarks that makes me cross my fingers for a book about just them. Maybe, Someday is original and adorable without being to sappy or to repetitive Favorite Quotes There isnt a doubt in my mind that we could be perfect for each others life, Sydney, Its our lives that arent perfect for us He failed to protect her from the harsh truth that people dont get to choose who they fall in love with. They only get to choose who they stay in love with Today is a really bad day, Syd. A really really bad day. Sometimes in life we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective Ive done nothing but try to be to hero who protects her. The problem? Heroines dont need protecting.
www.shelfnotes.com review Dear Reader, I enjoyed this book so much, even right after reading Cinder. I know I was a little harsh with Cinder but this series is growing on me and is starting to meet my expectations of what I want from a book. This one follows the story of Little Red Riding Hood, but completely twists it around. I think the Author did a much better job staying away from that linear approach she followed with the first book. Yes, the main character Scarlet has Riding Hood written all over her and she is searching for a lost Grandmother, plus she meets a guy nicknamed Wolf who might be connected to the missing Grandmother. However, you get a completely different story, she twisted it so much that the only recognizable things had to do with the characters themselves. I loved that. Scarlet is also set in France, which I found a little more comfort in. I dont know why but when reading Cinder, I didnt connect with the setting at ALL. Where was Cinder located? I almost felt like it was an alien planet. The setting brought me back to more of a futuristic Earth which is what I think the Author was going for. My friend told me recently Hi Marsha that the Author used these countries China for Cinder and France for Scarlet because that is where the origin of the fairy tale originated. I thought that was pretty neat and clever. This book also feels a little more rough, almost like a mystery splashed with western but set in a futuristic land, space cowboy? I was digging it. We have rebels, outlaws, gangs, kidnapping but it all tied down to the cliffhanger in Cinder perfectly. I liked how the Author connected two very different storylines and characters but made it feel very believable. I was also happy to see that Cinder got quite a bit of page time in this one  the cyborg is not forgotten! I cant wait to see what happens next but after all the books I took home from BEA and all the ARCs that have been backing up on my Kindle... I need to take a break and come back to this. I hope it doesnt ruin it for me but Id also love to finish the last half of the series in one giant chunk sometime when Winter comes out. Happy Reading, AmberBug
Shadows review posted on Guilty Pleasures 3 Stars Oh Come All Ye Kinky is aptly namedthis is a collection of almost entirely samesex couples involved in BDSM activities at Christmas time. Some of the stories are hot, all are emotional, and some really explore the harsher aspects of BDSM, including knife play, wax play with feathers!, suspension bondage and more. In Tree, Topper by Jane Davitt, Martin and Stan are a relatively new couple who care for each other, but who are uncertain in their roles. Martin, especially is unsure of his ability to be the Dom Stan needs. By talking everything out, they come to terms with their relationship. Twas the Night by Ava March is set in London in 1820 and Percy is desperately ashamed, not only of his homosexuality, but also of his submissive nature. Can Dom Michael ease his mind by forcing him to ask for what he wants? Kate Porters Fireworks features Emma and Rachel in their last session before Rachel heads to Tokyo for two years. Rachel always bails on people before they can leave her, but will her connection to Emma enable her to change? Candy Caning by L.A. Witt tells the story of submissive Nate and his Dom, Stephen as they prepare for Christmas dinner with Nates disapproving family. Stephens Christmas gift to him convinces Nate to forego a miserable evening to spend time with his lover. In Submissive Angel, by Joey W. Hill, Dom Robert explores a relationship with the man he rescued outside his toy shop, Ange. Open Return by Elyan Smith is about a seriously messed up guy who was born a girl, but has undergone surgery to remove his breasts and is now known as Zach. Comments such as Zach felt his pussy get wet, are a bit disconcerting. Even more, Zach had a relationship with a heterosexual couple in high school and wants to return to them. Alexa Snows Ring Out the Old and Ring in the New explores how Dom Russell can help his Sub, Evan, recover from a mugging that left him scarred both emotionally and physically. His Very Last Chance is about Dom Kingsley letting his sub, Drew, know how he really feels about him. As with any anthology, some of the stories were better than others, but all were pretty complete within themselves and contained lots of emotion. They were well edited and as long as you are into mm, ff, and mff, it was an interesting book. Review copy provided for an honest review.
I love the cover of Since Youve Been Gone and I have read quite a few raving reviews, so I had to get my hands on it. I had a 5 gift card from my Bing Rewards, so I think it was the perfect investment. I didnt really have any idea what the story was about, but I was quickly addicted to finding out. Likes: This book is a neat little package wrapped up in a bow. You slowly pull it apart and cannot wait to see what is inside, but the wrapping is so pretty you want to do it delicately. I love this whole book. I didnt want to go to sleep, I wanted to read. I wanted to hide away with this book and keep it a secret from the world. The book was so wellpaced, all the sudden I looked down and an hour had past and I was over halfway done with the book. I was sucked into the worldbuilding and Emilys life. I wanted to be part of the list and wished that my friends and I would have done something like that with each other. I especially love the lists Sloane would write for Emily when she was going on vacation. I know I say I can relate with so many characters, but Emily and I were so on the same page. I had a friend like Sloane and I was her shadow. She was a bright bulb and people really just new me as her friend. I was along for the ride, not enjoying the ride. Once my parents divorced and I had to start at a new school, I had to force myself out of my comfort zone like Emily did. Sloane was so neat, I cant help but wish we got more of her in this story. I think Morgan Matson should write this story, but from Sloanes POV. I have a new book boyfriend! I have the hugest book crush on Frank. Oh boy, I think he is at the top of my list now! Gripes: The only thing would be wanting more Sloane, as I have already mentioned. Favorite Quote: I knew the answer to that immediately. It was like swimming under the stars, like sleeping outside, like climbing a tree in the dark, and seeing the view. It was scary and safe and peaceful and exciting all at the same time. It was the way I felt when I was with him. Like a wellordered universe. For more reviews visit A Flurry of Ponderings
This and other reviews can be found on  I was sent this for review by Sourcebooks Fire. This in no way has impacted my review; all opinions are my own. Fun fact: I actually read this last holiday season, back in 2014! I really enjoyed Stephanie Perkins past works as well as several authors who wrote a short story for this. Im not going to go into detail for each short story but here are some things that I liked and disliked. Liked: perfect for holidays, especially NovemberJanuary! hilarious titles, such as What the Hell Have you done, Sophie Roth? and my favorite Beer buckets and Baby Jesus! very diverse, holidayreligionwise, racewise, sexualitywise. In terms of holidays, there was Hanukkah, of course Christmas, and even winter solstice! There is also a gay and interracial couple so that was really cool. My favorite was probably Its a Yuletide Miracle, Charlie Brown by Stephanie Perkins because it was so cute and one of those holidayfantasy type of short stories! This is the one with the winter solstice celebration :. In fact, this whole collection was a series of holiday fantasies. Each story was very warming and many, if not all characters did the best that they could in their situation. I think this would be perfect for reading oneaday 12 days before Christmas! The cover! It is super cute and honestly one of my favorite illustrated covers. I liked guessing which couple was who as I read it. Disliked: Some stories were meh and I ended up even skipping some pages just to get to the end. Because it is a collection of short stories, some of the stories and endings were nice but I wasnt hit with the feels, except for in Its a Yuletide Miracle, Charlie Brown In the end... I suggest picking this up during or before the holiday season. I actually wished I did the Read one a day, 12 days before Christmas thing; I think it wouldve made the experience sweeter. My True Love Gave to Me is the type of book that you read cuddled up in blankets next to the fireplace. You know, the bookstagramTumblr type of pictures you see. Also, when you are reading this, dont feel bad on skipping some stories if you didnt like the authors past work or you just arent feeling the story! In fact, I think starting next year, it is going to be a tradition to read Its a Yuletide Miracle, Charlie Brown every Christmas because I liked it that much.
PHEW.. I feel rung out right now. I just sat down and read this book cover to cover in just a few hours. My sisterinlaw lent me the book after raving about Colleen Hoover and all of her books. I can tell you that this book was not what I expected at all. I thought I was going to read a flowery book about a love triangle. Despite the back of the book, this is not what it is. Spoilers to follow.  This is a novel about domestic violence. This topic always pierces my heart because I got the horror of watching it happen to my mother with one of her boyfriends when I was younger. I very much appreciate the realistic way that Lily is shown falling into the trap of excusing abusive behavior from her perfect significant other. Atlas is important to the story line because he is the catalyst in a lot of their altercations. Ryle is aggressively jealous of Atlas and the idea that she could be cheating on him or hiding something from him. The most we actually see from Atlas is flashbacks in the form of letters to Ellen where you get to see a 15 year old fall in love with a homeless boy who has tried everything to get help and is just trying to graduate high school. He does pop up at significant moments ie., the first time Ryle meets Lilys mom. However, most of this happens from the perceived threat that Ryle feels. Atlas gives Lily his number in case she ever needs out very early on, and Ryle finds it months later which causes one of their altercations. All of these characters are brilliantly developed and I would be hardpressed to say who my favorite is. It could be Lilys mom for being brave enough to tell Lily to get out and not to repeat her mistakes, it could be Atlas who does pull himself up by his Marine bootstraps and make something of himself while waiting to save a woman he knew was in an abusive relationship. It could be Alyssa for her unending support of Lily despite Ryle being her brother. Finally, there is Lily. Lily who grew up in a house that was filled with domestic abuse and promised to never be her mother. Lily who found herself in the same position and then found the strength to leave when it wasnt easy. Lily who learned some hard adult truths about her parents and could respect and love them despite their flaws. Lily, who broke the cycle.
Visit Stay Bookish for more book reviews! Theres something about sad beautiful hopeful books that I can never shake off Jasmine Wargas debut novel, being one of them. Maybe its because it somehow makes me think about life and humanity among many other things. Maybe its because the characters and the words crawl into my heart, light it up with a spark and remind me that it isnt a black hole after all. Sometimes, for me, it feels like my grief is eating me alive. I always thought the hardest moments would be when I remember things about her, but thats not true. The hardest moments are when I miss her in the future. For a contemporary novel, My Heart And Other Black Holes is dark, delving on issues like depression and suicide. Aysel and her suicide partner, Frozen RobotRoman, both are haunted by their tragic lives and the people lost to them. Both own unbearable grief that vibrated through the pages and I kept thinking to myself while I was reading how much I wish I could take away their pain. In several ways, I really felt their hurt and their sadness. I think a large part of that was because Aysels narrative and voice was so genuine. As the main character, I connected with her a lot and I loved her Physics geek personality and her dark sense of humour. Moreover, the growth and development I saw in Aysel was very inspiring. I once read in my physics book that the universe begs to be observed, that energy travels and transfers when people pay attention. Maybe thats what love really boils down to having someone who cares enough to pay attention so that youre encouraged to travel and transfer, to make your potential energy spark into kinetic energy. While My Heart And Other Black Holes leaves a heavy feeling to the reader, I really really loved how Jasmine kept everything so honest not once disguising the characters melancholy thoughts or romanticizing suicide. That said, there is romance in the book. As Aysel and Roman plan the end of their lives together, they grow a connection so strong and exquisite. All through out the story, I was amazed by how their relationship and their feelings for each other became more solid and definitive. It honestly had me crying at 3am but I regret nothing. He squeezes my hand so tight, I cant feel it anymore. I wish someone would do that to my heart. I firmly believe it takes guts to write a novel like this one and I admire Jasmine so much for carrying it out brilliantly with her elegant and thoughtprovoking writing. As it pierced through my heart completely, I can attest that My Heart And Other Black Holes is poignant and moving and worth the read.
I remember seeing Poison Study on the shelves when it first came out, but passed it up several times because of, yes, I admit it, the cover. It was this older mass market paperback cover and not the lovely new trade paperback one. The girl on the old cover looked just a little too haughtily seductive for me. And I knew that Luna was the fantasy division of Harlequin and so I was suspicious it was a romance thinly disguised as fantasy. So when the new trade paperback came out, I went and read a few dozen more reviews just to make sure and decided to go ahead and give it a shot. Im so glad I did. Youd think Id have learned by now not to judge a book by its cover. Archangel, anyone? Poison Study opens with a young woman named Yelena imprisoned for murder. A murder she freely admits to committing. When a pair of guards yank her from the dank dungeon shes languished in for almost a year, Yelena is certain she faces imminent death. She even welcomes it in light of the hell her life has become in the past few years. More to come on that bit of nastiness later, we learn. But instead of the gallows, she finds herself in the office of Valek, the chief of national security i.e. the Commanders Personal Assassin being offered a choice. To be hung by the neck until dead or to become the Commanders Personal Food Taster. The last one having recently died on the job. Yelena chooses life and immediately begins a crash course in the art of poison detection. To complicate matters, Valek slips Yelena a deadly poison known as Butterflys Dust to ensure she wont attempt to escape the first chance she gets. In order to survive, Yelena must show up at Valeks door each morning for the antidote. Skip one morning and shell be dead within 48 hours. And all of this happens within the first few pages of the book. I was completely sucked in by page ten. The pace never slows throughout the rest of the book as we come to care more and more for this young woman who is forced to court death on an hourly basis. Piece by piece we learn more about why she was in the dungeon in the first place, her complicated background, and the demons that haunt her. Fortunately, her unquenchable will to survive and her quick mind earn her a few choice friends within the compound and these supporting characters are delightful and funny. Then there is Valek, the ruthless assassin who employs his vast array of frightening skills to protect Yelena even as he poisons her, convinced she is the missing piece of the puzzle in his quest to discover who is attempting to overthrow the government and why. I loved this book and I cant wait to read the sequel, Magic Study.
So yeah. I totally agree with the others who read this: The present was perfect and I was going to stay in it for as long as possible. Noah Stewart and Amanda Kelly have been bestfriends since birth. The one older than the other by a freakin minute, they share their every thing together. At first, itll seem like your typical Ifellinlovewithmybest friend story. 1. Telling each other everything. 2. Jealousy towards slutty girls. 3.Overprotective with one another. 4. Irrational need for each other. But no. It is so much more than that. Present Perfect will make you laugh, swoon, and feel frustration. Amanda or better known as Tweet is quite a frustrating character. I cant understand her logic through all of this. She cant help feeling jealous whenever Noah wanted to be another girl. Noah wanted to be with her, but shes too worried about the future to give them a chance. Hence, the title was born. The later parts are what I would call from now on as the killer parts . Noah and Tweet went on their separate ways, though they always seem to barge into each others lives every now and then. Every encounter they had were intense, not in the sense of the bedroom intense, but they were emotionallyfueled and always ended up in fighting and then making up. Noah Stewart is officially on my bookboyfriend list now. Theres something really sweet about him but at the same time, hes like most teenage boys who does teenage boy stuff that made Tweets heart break into pieces every single time. Yet, who can blame him? He got rejected. Then, just when I thought they will finally be together, something bad happened again testing their friendship and love for each other. Noah has 99.9 of my heart. The rest will always belong to a special boy who changed my life forever. Noah may be a hot piece of work, but Dalton Connor will always be my home boy. In the short time he spent on this books pages, he catches my attention and may be my favorite character with the personality all throughout. I will not talk about the ending nor spoil if this book will have its HEA or not. Because no matter what, this book is an absolute must read. Its a real tearjerker.
It Ends With Us is one of those books you think about long after youve finished reading. One of those books that you think of months later, remembering bits of it, picking up on little pieces you missed before, and while I never thought Colleen could top Confess, it would appear I was wrong, really, really wrong. Ive spent a lot of 2016 reading Colleen Hoovers fantastic books, but this one hit me on all kinds of levels. People have been raving about this book, and I can absolutely see why, its such an important read and it seems a lot more adult than Colleens other books. It Ends With Us is a personal novel to Colleen and I think thats why it shines so brightly and why it has such an impact  whenever authors write about something they know about, you can really tell, not that Colleens or anyones other books are poorer, this one just seems to have poured out of Colleen and straight into my brain. It just hit all the right spots, and Lily had such an interesting story, an interesting history, and she was such a strong, likeable character. This is really one of those books you need to read blind, knowing only the basics, that it involves a girl, two boys one from her past, one from her present and take it from there, because thats where youll get the best ever reading experience, Im not even kidding. I honestly got halfway through this book and I had no idea where it was going. I liked that it dove into Lilys past  her story with Atlas was so sweet and touching, all at the same time. And I loved that she wrote to Ellen Degeneres, for no reason at all than because she loved The Ellen Show, and Finding Nemo. Then there was her story with Ryle pronounced like Kyle, with a R. Right from their first meeting, there was a spark, and even after a sixmonth break that connection was so strong right from the word go. It seemed like the perfect love story  how this girl who liked telling naked truths turned the guy, adamant he wasnt a relationshiptype guy into a relationshiptype guy. Throw in owning her own business which gave me all kinds of feels and this just seemed like the most perfect book, but it wasnt. And that was the beauty of it. It was perfect despite the fact it wasnt all perfect for Lily, and discovering that and seeing her strength was pretty freaking amazing. This book is really special, it firmly cements Colleen Hoover on my favourite author list and the fact it surpasses Confess says it all, really, because that book was absolutely, ridiculously amazing, in every way, and It Ends With Us surpassed that. It gave me so many feelings, highs and lows, and it really, really hit me. It spoke to me, and its rare a book does that. It will, easily, make my list of top ten books of the year, it was that profound. Im really, really eager for a sequel. Please, Colleen, give us a sequel  or a fun Alyssacentric spinoff, because Alyssa and Marshall are a story in and of themselves, for sure. It Ends With Us will be remembered by me for the months to come, and I cant wait to reread it, because its the kind of book you can and will reread again and again.
On a random day in October, an invisible barrier cuts off the tiny town of Chesters Mill, Maine. Immediately a small plane crashes into it, and there are car accidents on both sides as they hit the wall. The Dome is impermeable to nuclear warheads and the military cant figure out who might have created it and what for. The meat of this novel has very little to do with the mystery of the Dome itself but more about small town politics gone insane. For years the town has been run by Second Selectman Jim Rennie, who has roped in the First Selectman, the pastor, and several others into running the countrys largest meth lab to finance the towns activities. Add in his son Junior, who at the moment of the Domes arrival has just murdered someone, and the death of the police chief who was the only one keeping Rennie in check, and you have a formula for disaster. While cell phones and internet seem to work through the Dome, the military calls upon Dale Barbie Barbara, a former soldier and nemesis of Junior Rennie, to take control of the town. Unfortunately, Jim Rennie is not going to let that happen. Though there were a lot of characters in this cast, I didnt even need to refer to the character list at the beginning of the book or the map, for that matter. It was interesting to see how the characters interacted, learning each persons secrets and seeing how they come into play. Some have compared this to The Stand and I can see what with the very clear good vs. evil the bad guys dont have many or any good qualities, but I think the added dimension here is that the characters had known each other their whole lives and watched themselves change from normal small town resident to psycho or hero whereas in The Stand, the characters could try to hide parts of their past and seem like they were on the good side when the reader knew they were not. The romance between two of the heroes seemed a bit random and forced to me  possibly because it showed up about 1,000 pages in. It may have taken me almost 3 weeks to read, but this was definitely a gripping story I think The Stand and It each took me two weeks to read and they are roughly the same length, but I also wasnt working full time.
Im giving this a 4.5 stars. I am so ridiculously happy with this book. Despite a few things I thought could be improved on. I was shocked by how dark and depressing this book is. After I read the first 100 pages I put the book down and had to take a second to think about what I just read. Obviously an alien invasion is not going to be happy, but I wasnt expecting how sad it was. I think that speaks to Yanceys writing ability. He had a nice imbalance of humour and sadness for the reader to feel despair but enough humour to continue reading. Im going to start with the one thing that I did not like about this book, but did like about it at the same time. The different perspectives fort disconnected from each other and pulled me out of the story each time they switched. I felt like I had to guess the perspective I was reading. However, I liked the perspective change because it opens up the world and we get to see different sides to the same characters. I was expecting the main character of this book to be Cassie. She thinks shes the last human alive trying to fight for her survival despite how hopeless and alone she is. I really enjoyed her as a character. I thought she was a believable character. What I enjoyed the most about her was her internal monologue, her thoughts. I thought they were hilarious and really fit her personality. Ben turned out to be such an interesting character. Cassie paints him to be this perfect, unattainable guy but in reality you realize that the way Cassie views him is not at all true. His character arc is very interesting, however its very easy to debate how unbelievable it really is. I wont go into detail about it since it contains spoilers. Evan, on the other hand, was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a generic hot, mysterious guy who becomes the love interest. Hes so much more than that. His story before the arrival and what happens before he meets Cassie is heart breaking. Overall, I really liked this story. There are a few parts that are not as believable as others, but it is a book about an alien invasion so who am I to say that its not believable.
I cant not give this 5 stars. This book was EPIC. I really dont know how else to describe it. I am finally getting around to writing this review! Its been a busy couple of weeks...Anyway, here we go! Spoilers peeps In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.George Orwell I loved this book. Its just everything that I want in a book and I absolutely loved it. I have always been obsessed with books that tell a story through documents and messages and other types of material. Any book thats not in typical prose always interests me. So when I heard about this book this summer I knew I needed to read it. I will admit the story starts off a bit slow because its hard to understand everything thats going on. In part that has to do with how the book is constructed, you really have to have a good imagination to read this. Its hard to picture everything thats going on but once you get the image in your head its fantastic. Id say I really really got into it after the first 100 pages. Once you get through the start its smooth sailing from there. Where do I even begin? Honestly, I do not know how to go about describing this book. I really just want everyone to read it. Ok. So the two main characters are Kady and Ezra. They are on two separate ships after their planet has been destroyed by their enemy fleet, Lincoln. Throughout the story a lot of crazy stuff is going on like other spacecrafts being blow up and plagues wiping through people. Its a pretty gritty book, the authors really dont hold back. Ezra and Kady are in the middle of this whole thing and we see their journey throughout the story. There are a lot of other characters that make this book great like McNulty trying not to cry and Byron again trying not to cry. I JUST LOVE EVERYONE IN THIS BOOK. Well, except Aidan. Hesheit is a psychopath. That should teach us the bad side of technology kids. One day it could overtake us, you never know.... Am I not merciful? Ok the Mozart killing scene was probably one of the best scenes. I mean it was horrible because Aidan literally killed everyone but including the part about Mozart playing and everything, it was just perfect. I could picture the scene perfectly. And then the same song plays again when Kady escapes. It goes full circle it seems. You are insects to me, and still everything I do is to protect you. Everything. I understand that Aidan is afraid to be shut down again but he is insane. And tricking Kady was the cruelest thing to do. Ugh. THIS BOOK IS JUST SO GOOD. THERES SO MUCH IN IT. Like there was a reference to Boethius. I read his book The Consolation of Philosophy during my freshman year of college for my humanities class and I thought Id never think about it again. WELL I WAS WRONG. I was so happy when I picked up on it. This book is just packed with really great stuff and really deep stuff as well. I loved it and I cant stop recommending it. SO GO READ IT. They are beyond me. These humans. With their brief lives and their tiny dreams and their hopes that seem fragile as glass. Until you see them by starlight, that is.
 spoiler alert  I really enjoyed this book, and at the same time was disappointed. I stand by the four stars becasue I was so motivated to finish it I read it in one sitting, but had this been a stand alone story, I dont think I would have gone higher than 3. I had just finished rereading books one and two, and I think I was more motivated to have answers than by the third installment being so moving. I was so excited to read the conclusion of what was an amazing trilogy, but at the same time I felt throughout the book that I needed more. The characters in the book were as amazing as ever. I will say I even started to understand team Gale, although I will forever be team Peeta. I was upset multiple times throughout the book for both of them, but especially when Katniss and we realized how damaged Peeta was and when Katniss realized it may have been Gales snares that killed Prim and knew she would never get past it. I was also glad to see the author give Prim some more screen time in this one. In the first two books, I felt we always had to just take Katnisss word on how great she was but never really heard or saw her do anything. With that being said, I was disappointed with how a lot of the action played out. Katniss was constantly injured, but she wasnt really involved in the rebellion, other than on camera. I found that I missed the games in this book which I found so compelling in the first two because there wasnt enough other action to take their place. We didnt really get to see how any of the rebellion was playing out in the districts, just simply that the rebels were winning while everyone sat in 13. It all seemed too easy. Then, the last mission Katniss and crew went on seemed to play out like some sort of Saving Private Ryan scene, except the end of the mission was all muddled as Katniss once again was injured and passed out only to wake up in the hospital. I had to reread the few pages after she passed out several times to even figure out what was happening and was annoyed that Boggs ominous last words never felt really explained. During this book Katniss seemed constantly unsure of who to trust, and by the end I wasnt sure as to who she should have been trusting, if anyone. However, despite being disappointed with the third book, I think for the most part I was satisfied with the conclusion and my opinion of the trilogy as a whole remains high. While some of my questions went unanswered, I enjoyed the point I felt the author was trying to make about society etc. And of course I was psyched that Peeta and Katniss were together in the end, despite how broken they may have been.
Still debating between 4 and 4.5 This is my second novel written by Victoria Schwab the first being A Darker Shade of Magic and I must say that she does not disappoint! To be honest I was really worried about This Savage Song because Im a newbie in Fantasy novels so I was really wary about the monsters. However, it turned out that I was worrying for nothing. The thing about Victoria Schwab is that she writes in such a compelling way that even when I need to put down the book for a while, the events that took place in the world she created would always be playing in my mind. She has this ability to make things stick out. I think part of this also stems from how unique her books and her worlds always are. Its as though they have their own genre. In This Savage Song, the author created a world were monsters are born from the vicious deeds of people. There are three types of monsters  Corsai, Malchai and Sunnai, and August is the latter, who are born from the most extreme bad deeds. Kate, on the other hand, is a human who construes herself as a badass in order to gain her fathers approval. But dont get me wrong, its not at all done in a petty manner. I really enjoyed the companionship if you can call it that between Kate and August during the latter parts of the novel. I really liked how there was no romance between them, and how they were there for each other, but not at all in the cheesy kind of sense. These two characters are so complicated in that they are unlike any other character Ive ever met before, and so their companionship is also something that is complicated. These two are just as unique as the plot, and I really dont know how V.E. Schwab managed to do it so well. Oh my gosh, that ending! I dont know what this author is trying to do to me, but that ending is just ahbkshdfk! I cant even find the right words! I really need the next book, like since I read the last word of this book. Ugh, waiting so long for the next book will hurt my brain and my heart. Thank you, V.E. Schwab, for yet another amazing novel. You never cease to amaze me, and the feeling as well as the experience of reading this book is truly unique and unforgettable. You are one of the best authors of the fantasy genre, and I look forward to reading more of your work. Just please, dont kill us with cliffhangers every time.
Iolanthe Seabourne is an elemental mage who sets out to create a dazzling display of her magical abilities for a wedding, but her guardian forbids it. He tells her that agents of Atlantis will find her if she calls attention to her magical gifts. Iolanthe thinks this is ridiculous. But when she calls lightning from the sky, her guardians greatest fears come true. Its not only agents from Atlantis who come running, though. Prince Titus, Master of the Domain, shows up and helps her hide. His mother prophesied the coming of a great elemental mage, and Prince Titus believes Iolanthe is that person. Whether or not she believes in her own powers, she is being hunted. So Iolanthe goes undercover at the princes boarding school as the boy Archer Fairfax, in hopes of living long enough to decide who she really is and what she wants to do. This book took me a bit to get into for a couple reasons. I couldnt figure out where the Domain was. At first I thought this was a new fantasy world. But then there was talk of Sleeping Beauty and Atlantis, and then the prince went to London, so I was confused. The book point of view shifts between Iolanthe and Prince Titus, scene by scene. It was jolty at first, but I got used to that quickly. The other things that felt a bit cliche were the Latin spellswhich seemed very Harry Potterthe magical powers that came from nowherebirth, and the fact that Iolanthe was going undercover as a boy. I still dont know where the Domain is, but regardless, I really liked this story and got to the point where I couldnt put it down until I finished it. For the few clichetype things, there are many original things in this book that I found brilliant. The Crucible, for one, which is a book that one can travel into to practice spells and warfare and to learn from those who came before. Former rulers are immortalized when they create their own room in which they teach lessons. This is a fantasy romance novel for teens. Its the first in a trilogy. The characters were fun and realistic. Romance is a big part of the story but didnt overwhelm the plot. For concerned parentsreaders, as far as content goes, there are a few passionate kisses. There are some crude jokes between the boys at the boarding school. And there a few sexual innuendosjokes between the prince and Iolanthe. Bstrd was used a couple times. Maybe two or three. Overall, I liked the book and look forward to book two.
What started off as a jumble of characters attempting to survive in Dorothys horror story that is Oz, ends up being an action packed adventure that I couldnt put down! Plot: Amy Gumm is what the other girls call trailer park trash; one day while her mom is out getting her fix, Amy and her pet rat, Star, are swept away to the fictional Oz. The beginning of the novel seemed a bit...off. We start off with Amy commenting on her social life and the Queen B of the school, her moms additions, and then we are in Oz. I kind of felt like I was in a roller coaster with the pacing of this story: one moment we are getting character development, then we are rushing through Oz, and then we have a love story kind of, then were at the end of the first installment. Throughout this novel, I was set on a firm 3.5 because of the pacing, but the ending made me reconsider and give it a 4. That being said, Dorothy Must Die is a creative story that isnt afraid to hold back. I love dark and creepy writing, but some of the descriptions of killings and amputations made me grimace. Characters: Dorothy Must Die is told from Amys perspective, this allows us, the reader, to experience Oz firsthand through her eyes, and it is gruesome. Amy is joined by a large cast of characters, like a lot of characters. In the beginning, I thought that too many were being introduced, but they all tied in together in the end. There was a hint regarding romance between Dorothy and a fellow resistance leader, but I wasnt too interested in it. This time, the story trumped the love story which was a good thing because I was more interested in Dorothys dark and twisted ways. My favorite characters would have to be Dorothy friends: The Scarecrow, The Cowardly Lion, and The Tin Man.. Their personalities and appearances were nothing like you remember from the movie. From mauling to sword hands, they are the things my nightmares are made of. Setting: The World of Oz gets a five out of five from me. Ms. Paige does an excellent job articulating that this is not your normal Oz; the land is barren and the citizens live in terror. Everything in Oz is described with such vivid imagery that is all thanks to the authors beautiful writing style. Short N Sweet: This imaginative sequel to The Wizard of Oz will have you hold your breath, grimace, and cringe until the wicked witch is dead. The only thing keeping this novel from being a fivestar rating is its pacing in the beginning.
www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com 2 Words! MIND. BLOWN. I read Armada first because it was all over goodreads with good reviews and I loved it, but different people said I should read the first one, that it was better..... It was AWESOME! Even though this book is in the future 2044 its set up like a major 80s blast from the past. I was so in my element I could have done a little dance. BTW: I want my own OASIS! OASIS is the virtual world like nothing I have ever thought of in my life. You play games there, watch movies, eat, I mean I could sit here and go on forever telling you all of the things you can do, but I really think if you are a game fan and an 80s fan then you should read this book! Wade Watts has been playing in this world since he was little...his home life wasnt ideal. Then one day the owner of OASIS posts a video talking of his death and since he has no heirs that whoever finds the hidden egg in the game will win all of his billions of dollars. And this world is humungo so you know this is going to be hard to do. I mean Wade and tons of other people try to find this egg for years. Can you even imagine! Wade watches every single thing Halliday ownercreator ever watched, listened to, read, games he played even commercials he watched. You name it and Wade was going through it all over the years and memorizing everything he could. Wade also has some friends in the game and he makes some new friends. But they are all fighting in this competition and of course there are the evil people. Suddenly after all of these years someone finds one of the keys and a clue, then they all start finding them. The ride is awesome! This man set this world up so amazing in this game I really wish I could give out spoilers! I feel like I was going back in time with all of the references.. from Family Ties the show to Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan match in wrestling. Andre : Oh and in the beginning Wade was talking about an old atari game called Adventure with the square and the dragons! I have that! That was my favorite game, well its around here somewhere, never found it when we moved, but I digress. There is even a really cool part that has to do with the movie War Games, remember with Matthew Brodrick and Ally Sheedy. I think I just butchered their names, anyway, its incredible. They have to do some really tough challenges and some people die, I found that very sad because of the way it happened. The ending was sooooo good. I had the biggest smile on my face when I finished this book. Its definitely a keeper and I have my copy on my amazon wish list right now. If you havent read this and it sounds at all interesting to you then READ IT!
Yet another masterpiece by Sarah J. Maas. She gets me! Omg, I just cant even. Its like she knew what I wanted and put it all on one book. She really does seem to have a thing for fairies and is refreshing to see them featured in stories although they sometimes seem more Elf After reading this book and seeing her talent in both writing on third person, first person, multiple POV and single POV, I have to admit she is joining my list of favorite authors. This book is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. Even though it was a retelling the author does a fantastic job at not letting it be entirely predictable. The story is told through the eyes of Feyre These names seriously! the youngest of a family that has fallen into misfortune and has to go hunt to bring food for her family. During one of these hunts, she accidentally kills a Fae unleashing a beast that comes barging through her door demanding retribution. After explaining the treaty between Fae and Humans he demands that she has to go with him back to the Fae lands, which is divided by an invisible wall, and live with him. After this we see a story packed of action and romance that makes it almost impossible to close the book. I cannot express how much I love this book. Sarah J. Maas has this ability of creating a cast of characters that you cant help but to love. The story telling is well paced and she takes her time letting the reader get to know the characters before she begins revealing a wonderful world. I loved how she cleverly used the aspects of the fairy tale and incorporated it in a believable way. I loved that instead of just having a beast she gave him a mask to hide under. The story engages you so much that you forget that is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast until a revelation slaps it on your face. Bravo just bravo! I loved the dynamic of the characters. Feyre was a little annoying at first but then she grew on me. Tamlin...just, just growl, he can be my beast whenever he wants. He was so gentle and awkward and just yes! Rhysand, oh Mr. Badboy our Gaston. He is just a Fae version of Loki in a way. Then we have Lumiere as Lucien which I loved his snarky and smartass attitude. A beautiful cast indeed, especially Tamlin and Rhysand. Because I have to admit with some of those scenes, I had to stop, take a moment. Those two will leave you melting! If you liked Throne of Glass you are going to love this book. Even though I sometimes wished I could see from the point of view of the other characters, I wouldnt change it one bit. There is nothing I can complain about. Its very rereadable so go pick it up. Now, go enjoy it while I deal with my feels.
Men mock the gods until they need them, Kaz. From the moment I read the first chapter of this book, I knew immediately I was going to love it. Everything about it was right up my alley. Criminals in a high fantasy setting. What could be better? This book was phenomenal. The characters were all so complex, and amazing, I loved them all. Actually, most of them. The book was professionally written. I love how the author thought carefully about the plans Kaz would make, unlike other authors who usually make plans very simple and easy. Kazs plans were complicated, and intricate. So was this book. Kaz was such an intriguing character, and the more we found out about his past, the better character he became. I loved learning about why he always wears gloves, and how he became what he currently is. It was very refreshing to see a protagonist that was not all heroic, and noble. Inej is my favorite character. She is honestly what I want to be in life. She was so brave, and wonderful. Learning more about her was probably one of my favorite things in this book. She is such a nicely written character. Jesper is my second favorite. He was funny, and a very joyful thing put in a very nonjoyful place. I wish that we got to see more of him, and learnt more about his backstory, I am hoping we will see more of that in the second book. I had a lovehate relationship with Nina. In moments, I would adore reading about her, whereas other moments I would just be really annoyed by her. i dont know why, but I just did not feel much about her. Although towards the ending, I started to like her more. I honestly dont know what I think of Matthias. Mostly, I did not feel anything towards him. Not hate, and not love, either. I guess I just saw Matthias as average? He was interesting sometimes, but I kind of did not care much about him. Wylan clearly has something hes hiding, but I dont know what it is? He was funny at times, especially with the whole, Remember our friend Mark? thing. Other than that, I am unsure what to think of him as well. Overall, this book was fantastic. I loved everything about it. Easy 55 stars.
Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love. It did not end well. This book is one of my top favorites of 2013. I cant believe it took me so long to read it, even after Id heard amazing reviews about it. Daughter of Smoke and Bone was an enchanting read, with vivid and imaginative descriptions, and fascinating characters. Right from the start, I was enthralled. Karou, with her weirdness and errands, was a character I liked from the beginning. Shes very different, but she also feels empty inside. Desolate. Lost. She doesnt know who she is or where she came from. All she knows is Brimstones shop, teeth, wishes, and the chimeara who live with him. But finding out her past could be worse than still living in naivety. Karou is not simply a heroine who takes the backseat; she doesnt wait around for someone else to tell her what to do. When she finds herself stranded in Prague, alone, she takes matters into her own hands to find her family. And learn her past. Finding out the truth about who and what she is takes on an unexpected urgency when Karou tangles with a beautifully deadly angel on one of her errands. It sets in motion a turn of events that shapes the course of the story. There is little I can tell you about the plot of the book, because its all so tangled and interwoven that, to tell you one thing, might spoil an important angle. But what a beautifully written love story! It made me so happy, this forbidden love aspect. I absolutely adored Akiva. He is one sexy angel! From a deadly first encounter to a connected past, I adored watching these two fall in love. And I didnt mind that, because of the connection, theyd already had this burning passion for each other. It worked for this story! I loved having those flashbacks to the past, and I SHIP THESE TWO SO MUCH. 3 This tale of forbidden love, of monsters and angels, of courage and sacrifice, of love and hope was simply amazing. This story sings to my soul. I was captivated. I was fascinated by these characters, their oddities and uniqueness. And that ending rendered me utterly speechless. I have no clue what to think about Akivas betrayal, his vengeance. Daughter of Smoke and Bone had a fairytale feel to the storyline. The authors writing style was able to draw me in with its vibrant imagery and lyrical descriptions. The scenes painted vivid pictures in my head, and the characters came to life before my very eyes. This book was, in one word, enchanting.
Even paradise could become a prison if one had enough time to take notice of the walls. Stars Out of 10: 7.510 Overall Thoughts: I really enjoyed this book, and how its written and planned out is different from most fantasy novels. It actually reminded me of how Game of Thrones is formatted, or atleast how Ive heard its formatted, as I havent read the series yet. There were some parts of the authors style that needed getting used to, such as how frequently she killed off characters and how she went about making those deaths seem important, but I believe that now that I understand Rhodes style more the rest of the series will seem a bit better. I do believe that with its flaws, it was still a really good book, and I truly enjoyed it! SPOILERS BEGIN HERE The Good: I loved the diversity of the characters, as how they reacted to things was actually quite different from each other. I also enjoyed how the main characters arent on the same side, so we almost have to choose who we believe is good, and who we want to win. The Bad: I thought the character deaths seemed a bit too constant, and made the lives of those characters way less important. I also thought that the love of Theon and Cleo was pretty instantaneous, which was a trope I was never truly a fan of. The Characters: While I loved the characters, I wasnt really a fan of how they died. It was frequent and sometimes unnecessary, with some not really seeming to make a big impact. I do realize that Basilius and Tomas were very important deaths, as they actually moved the plot forward, but the deaths of Theon, King Corvin, and Emilia were a few of the ones that werent fully made into a plot device yet. However, I hope to see those deaths being put to use in the second book! The Plot: I enjoyed the plot of this book, but I do feel it was a bit plain. Dont get me wrong, it was good, but it was also simple. Three countries want power, two gang up on the other, then stronger country betrays weaker country. Even the personal plotlines never truly surprised me, as when there was a twist, it was heavily, very heavily, hinted at, such as Lucia being the orphan child in the prologue and Gauis betraying Basilius. However, the author concealed her plot of the Kindred and magic well, as I did not guess Eirene was the Watcher, and that Cleo would be Evas descendant. The World Building: I really enjoyed how they built the world, from its history to its current, and gave real reasons for why the war was happening, and why everyone agreed to it. I especially like how the religion and magic was built, and that was definitely one of my favorite aspects of the book. The Stereotypical Tropes: InstaLove, A Chosen OneDestined One The Favorite Character: Theon Ranus may his poor soul rest in peace Buy it, Borrow it, Or Bin it: Buy it! This review can also be found on my blog: 
lockhart is a cruel evil bastard of an author who i feel is playing a great joke on us. Let me give you my reasons why. CONTAINS SPOILERS First of all, the story begins with the facts, her injury. How she was in the sea, doesnt know how it happened, doesnt remember an entire summer. Yeah. Lockhart has built up the characters so well in the story. I began to love the characters, feel the characters, and understand more and more of them. But as soon as you begin to long more and more for CadyGat to stay together, for the liars to continue being great. You realise that they all die. ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT CADY LOVED MOST, THE ONES SHE DESCRIBED MOST, THE ONES WE AS READERS LOVED DEARLY, they all die. Poof. She began to remember her memories and then part five begins. AND THEY ALL DIE! The book is so well placed, Lockhart was so smart with this. I have read the Fly on the wall a few years back as well as Dramarama, but this has left me permanently scarred in the greatest way possible. When i think back on it, the liars didnt eat at the clairmont anymore, they stood away when she came by, lived alone, barely slept, and so much more that makes so much sense now that i know that they died. Before it wasnt so important, but just the smart placement of these simple fact just makes it so much bigger when you reach the great twist. Throughout the book there are the Once upon a Times thingies which i love just as dearly. Its like Cadys way of making it more jokey yet more serious. Especially one of the last ones with the curse. I felt something coming, and again, going back to it made so much more sense. But it wasnt that I didnt understand it, just the words between the lines are so much clearer. I would have never came across the idea that they were dead, never. As a reader, you usually fill in the blanks with the most obvious idea to go with the story. I fell for it. It was so real, so believable. I just want to read it over and over again, buy box after box of tissues at dollarama. Because what Lockhart does here is plays with your emotions like a master.
This review was originally posted on unConventional Bookviews Yeah. It most definitely should end with them. It Ends with Us is a bit different from CoHos other stories with more mature characters. There are quite a few things that are similar too, though: the amazing writing, the characterdriven story, and my tears... It Ends With Us is a very strong and necessary story. It deals with some pretty heavy subject matters, and I have actually already used it as an example of something important with a young woman I know... Lily Bloom is a very strong woman, and she has built so many walls around herself and her heart that she might have been completely impenetrable, but she wasnt. The story itself starts with some chance encounters, and it has one part of the action happening in the present, and another part in the past, where Lily reads through her old journals to try to make peace with her past and the people in it. Having empathy and understanding for other people and their problems is something I think is really important. And It Ends With Us truly made me walk a few miles in someone elses shoes, and it definitely put some things in perspective for me. I had some preconceived notions about some kinds of relationships, and I really dont think I do anymore  so kudos to CoHo for managing to really make me see things from a different point of view. Most of the story in It Ends With Us is from Lilys point of view, and as I said above, there are parts set in the present and other parts set in the past. There is definitely a lot of heartache, but I didnt feel completely overwhelmed by sadness until the end. The range of emotions I felt was complete, though, and I think this is one of CoHos strong suits. She manages to so fully make me believe in her characters, that seem so real because theyre flawed, that I immediately want their life to be the best it can be. If you havent picked up this book yet, you should just put down everything youre doing right now and go grab it! And start reading it! Other than the incessant singing, shes pretty tolerable. Shes clean and shes gone a lot. Two of the most important qualities in a roommate. I did notice he laughed at all the right times. I think good comedic timing is one of the most important things about a persons personality.
I know what youre thinking. 5 stars? Really? Believe me, no one was more shocked than me. This was my second time reading The Host, I had previously read it right after its release. I remember liking it, but then I kind of forgot about it because I was still on my OMG Twilight is the best thing ever! kick. But with the movie coming out, I decided to give it another go. And Im so glad I did. I actually think I liked this book better than Twilight gasp. While this book wasnt perfect  the beginning was a little slow and some parts dragged a little too much  I was extremely intrigued by these characters. I feel like Meyer finally got it right with character details. One of the things that bothered me about the writing in Twilight was that the side characters were overlooked when it came to details and personality. Meyers writing skills definitely grew here and the outcome was a wellrounded supporting cast. The relationship between Wanda and Melanie was done well. I felt each girl as an individual and understood their struggle with learning how to live this way. I loved the way each girl got to view each others species through one set of eyes. And while Wanda was the selfsacraficing female that Meyer loves to write, her sacrafice was something I could understand. She was trying to help those she grew to love. There was absolutely no selfishness on her part. Now the boys. While this can be seen as a love triangle love square?, it wasnt the most obvious of one. Melanie loved Jared. Jared loved Melanie. Ian loved Wanda. Wanda loved both Ian and Jared, but in two different ways. Jared was the love she knew because of Melanies feelings for him. He was what was familiar and home to her. But on the other side, Ian became someone for her to love by his openness and willingness to accept her, not as a body but as a soul. And you werent really rooting for one guy to win, because there were honestly two girls. It was more about the fight to not lose Melanie but keep Wanda. I adored Ian. He stole the book for me. As a character, he had growth. In the beginning, he despised Wanda  much like everyone else. But slowly, we watched him change and I loved every minute of it. I heard that Stepenie Meyer is almost done with the second one and I sure hope this is true. I have so many questions about this new world and so many things were left unanswered. Consider me all in.
The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true. Well Inej, my heart is currently pointing directly at Six of Crows. Hey, friend. Do you like diverse characters? Do you like to read about characters with disabilities? Characters from different lands, with different CULTURES  characters with different languages, religions? Do you like to see that in your fantasy books? How about equally strong male and female leads? With flaws, ambitions, and fears? You bet you do. Well Six of Crows has you covered. Now, I dont really remember how I stumbled upon this book. I think it was in the wake of my last reading disappointment, which resulted in me desperately seeking a pickmeup. This turned out to be so much more than that. Because this book is smart. It is so goddamn smart, so well put together. I think I was a little in love with this story from the moment I read the premise. A loveable band of outcasts, an impossible mission. These are the things that fuel me. We learn about our band of misfits in several ways. Both through the way they are developed in the story, and through flashback scenes which are expertly interwoven into the main arc. Yeah, DELICIOUS right? Leigh Bardugo introduces memories, past experiences, little glimpses into their backgrounds, which ripple through the book but never interrupt the main thread. Just thinking about that has me drooling over my keyboard a little. The characterisation is superb. They are all so compelling, so unique and imperfect and wonderful. Just, utterly human and believable. Then theres the romance! Yes, there is romance. But dont worry, it is good romance, it is great frigging romance guys. Real feelings, REAL HUMAN EMOTION. Because love is not easy, falling into love has it challenges. Who would have thought? And I want that, I want to read about challenging love! The personalities of these characters was not in ANY WAY sacrified for the sake of a hook up! They have a past, they have flaws! Thank you Leigh Bardugo, thank you so so much for writing about human emotion in this way. Thank you for not letting romance and pairings overwhelm your story telling. This was so perfectly done, I am so happy about it. What else did I love? Oh yes. The Grisha. I havent read the Grisha trilogy so, this was my first introduction, and I LOVE it. I love it. Such a good balanced way of writing magical elements. It felt very real and it was utterly fascinating. I will simply have to read more about the Grisha. Was there anything I disliked? No. Not really. Perhaps some elements felt a bit cliche some of the twists and turns I felt were a little too easily sign posted. But others knocked me off my feet. And I really dont have a single bad word to say about this book. holds a lighter aloft NO MOURNERS. NO FUNERALS.
More Reviews Here: Readers Live A Thousand Lives At this point there is nothing I can say about this book that hasnt already been said. It has been raved about and cried over by practically every single bookish person I know. Therefore part of me feels as if this review is a bit useless, because what can I say that hasnt already been said numerous times. However, I have a lot of feelings when it comes to this book and this is my outlet. This book is a gift. That is the best word I can use to describe it. It is wonderful and beautiful and the writing is fantastic. I was hanging on every single word. The story builds up ever so slowly and the story is pulled apart layer by layer and piece by piece. Nothing is handed to you all at once. Even when you think you know everything there is to know, there is still more to the story. It is the best kind of torture. I spent the entire book frustrated and an emotional wreck... in the best possible way of course. This book packs an emotional punch, but not necessarily in a bad way. Simply put, the book makes you feel and feel with your whole heart. I laughed, I cried, I sighed, I screamed, I danced around like a little girl, and at one point tossed my iPad in a fit of rage. This book will break you down and tear you apart, only to put you back together. Once you become invested in the story, there is no turning back. The characters we meet are truly broken and together they find some semblance of peace, but that peace does not come easy. Nastya is a character that broke my heart. To see the pain she was living with killed me, and it killed me even more because I had no idea what made her the way she was. Then we have Josh and I really loved Josh. This was another character that broke my heart because of all the pain he had to deal with. This review would not be complete if I didnt mention Drew. Drew brings lightness to the story that is very much needed with Nastya and Josh. There is so much more I want to say about the characters, but so much of the story is focused on the characters journey that to do so would be considered spoilery. This book hurt, and it hurt a lot. I loved every single second of the hurt. It was also original. The whole concept it opens to and the way the story is told is genius. It may be a contemporary with broken characters, but it is like no other book out there in the genre. It also had the ABSOLUTE BEST closing line in a book I have ever read. Can you say uncontrollable sobbing? Cause that was me. It was pure perfection. The Sea of Tranquility is a book everyone needs to experience. So if there is anyone left out in the world that has not picked up this book, please remedy that as soon as possible.
3.5 stars I was in a big reading slump so I was looking for a series that I could glom, something that would be utterly riveting and brilliant. Ive heard about this series and seen its great reviews and I thought perfect! This is just the thing I am looking for. As YA Fantasy, it provided a big enough difference than the other books I was reading, primarily Romance and Urban Fantasy so I was excited to jump into this world. Right off the bat you can tell that Maas is an excellent writer. Her writing is eloquent and polished and I found it very easy to read and follow. In fact, I read this entire book in one night so I can see why so many people enjoy this series. The problem for me was that I felt like for half the book nothing really happened. Maas takes a long time to really set up the plot. Celaena is the most dangerous assassin and in order to gain her freedom, she needs to prove to everyone that she is the best. So she is forced to compete against other dangerous characters for the title of kings assassin. Nearly half the book passed already I never really felt like she got a real look at Celaena personality. It shows eventually in small increments as she lets out a smile here and there, but its a slow process. As is the case with the romance. Now I know this is only the first book in the series but a smile here or a little bit of teasing there isnt really going to hold my interest for long. I dont mind see a softer side to the heroine, just like I have no problems seeing the badass side to her either. But I just dont think it was shown in its greatest capacity in the first half of the book. You really have to be patient with this to enjoy it. Since the heroine is an assassin and this is a Fantasy world we are reading about, I was also expecting a lot of violence and maybe some magical creatures. There is mention of it but it doesnt really go into much depth and development. In fact, the violence almost happens behind the scenes as the competitors are killed one by one. So all in all while I did eventually enjoy the book, I do still have some small problems with it. I think you have to be patient to really enjoy this series in the long run.
BOOK REVIEW by Michelle 25th July 2014: RATING: 4.75 CLEVER STARS!! This is going to be a short review because I simply CAN NOT SPOIL anything. I will say the back blurb was absolutely correct. I WAS LEFT REELING and I will add I had a ridiculous cry too. I C.R.I.E.D. I am not sobbing anymore, but tears stream from my eyes without cease. You know something is coming, but this book is written in such a way that I had all these theories bobbling about in my head. You cant help but try to figure out what is going on. You look for things, but at the same time, E. Lockhart writes in such a way that she is hiding those things, until she is ready to knock you off your perch. Sometimes I was wondering where everything was heading and I can see how this book wont be everybodys cup of tea, because she writes in a unique way. I personally got it. I think it added to the whole feel of her story telling. I thought it was very creative, inventive and if you look carefully enough and listen to her words as they enter your head you will actually see what she is doing. Cady is quite a clever character. Aaand I need to sshhush up now! Sometimes I thought the characters spoke in a way that sounded almost EnglishBritish. Maybe it was me? This book has garnered on Goodreads alone, over 25,000 ratings since its original release in May 2014. Australias release date is August 1st 2014 with Allen  Unwin. I think we get the better title font which is more fitting to the story line. This book is mysterious, intriguing, sometimes you are doing a bit of WT, but you gotta keep reading. E. Lockhart has a beautiful style about her writing. It really is a very different read, when it hits you... my god it hits you!!! I felt like I was Cadence. I was as lost a she was. Together we wanted answers and together we were finding those answers. I forgot who I was when I was reading. I became Cadence. I have had a little trouble all day settling down since I finished it this morning. It is indeedy haunting, disturbing, secretive and clever. A very clever and memorable read. The universe is seemingly really huge right now, he told me. I need something to hold on to. Be prepared to have your breath knocked out of you. Michelle
As seen on The Quiet Concert The word obsessed does not even begin to describe how I feel about this book. From the moment I started listening, I didnt want to stop. No, better yet, I couldnt stop. I was hooked. GOSH, it was just SO MUCH FUN. I am getting an adrenaline high just writing this review. Ready Player One takes place not too far into the future. The world is fraught with problems and most of humanity finds their escape through a virtual reality net called the Oasis. The book begins with the death of the Oasiss creator, James Halliday, who leaves his fortune and control of the Oasis to the first person who can collect 3 keys and pass through the matching gates to find the hidden egg. GAME ON. Anyone who is hunting for the egg is known as a Gunter but a divide quickly forms between your everyday gamers and the evil IOI employees who want to win to monetize the Oasis. These Sixers made for great villains and scary advisories considering they had limitless resources and no morals. Wade is the first Gunter to find the first key and pass through the first of gate but other Gunters are not far behind him. But even though they are competitors, a friendship of sorts begins to form between the High Five, even a budding romance between Wade and Art3mis. I loved this gang of characters and their easy banter with each other. And I loved them even more later in the story as certain truths are revealed this is me being coy. They were all honorable, intelligent, totally nerdy people aka MY KIND OF PEOPLE. I seriously loved everything about this book  from discovering new parts of the Oasis, to the hunt for the egg, to all of the late 20th century pop culture references even though I didnt get half of them. I already love questtestriddlebased stories and this book was a questtestriddlebased story on crack. I mean, ANYTHING is possible in a virtual net and Cline made sure to take advantage of that. There were epic jousting games and giant robot battles and high stake video game marathons. The avatars had crazy weapons, abilities and magic. I honestly could not get enough. Everything spoke to my inner geekgamerkid. I honestly dont know if Ive said anything of actual value in this review but I could never do it justice anyway. Just know that this book gave me all the feels and is now one of my alltime favorites ever ever ever. YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. And buy this book. And hug this book. And love this book. Now excuse me while I go read it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
REVIEW FOR 2016: YAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS REVIEW FROM 2013: Please, just give me sometime to pick my jaw up off the ground... Okay. This book was so unbelievably good, it picked up right from where Shatter Me ended and built so well. The character development in this in terms of understanding more about each character was great! Thoughts: Im sorry but I cant keep this spoilerfree SPOILERS 1 After reading Destroy Me the novella that comes between Shatter Me and Unravel Me, I wanted to fly to wherever Tahereh Mafi lives just to tell her to make Warner and Juliette work. Warner has been developed so much more and is so much deeper and more interesting in comparison to Adam. At first, youre obviously drawn to Adam because they have a connection from previous times but other than that, he is not a very interesting character. 2 The writing in this book was so beautiful, there were some parts that rhymed and Im not sure if it was on purpose, but it made the book so enjoyable to read. You didnt just see text but you saw a whole story in your head. 3 I would say that Adams lack of development in this book was a bit disappointing, he just continually clung to Juliette. And thats fine but it doesnt feel right. He feels connected to her because he saw her shunned and cast away when she was younger but his emotions are on the verge of being unrealistic. 4 The scene between Warner and Juliette the intimate one. Oh gawsh. It was so awesome to read about, I swear my heart was beating as fast as theirs because thats how awesome it was for me. However, I kept expecting something to go wrong. And it did. I was fairly annoyed, not because it happened, but it felt so out of the blue and random that it felt like it was just forced in there to keep their relationship from developing. 5 Seeing Juliette grow in this book e.g. become more responsible, give people a chance and learn to harness her power was incredible. There was such great development nearing the end but still, there are some subconscious doubts that she still has to clear. Hopefully, through her neardeath experience, she will become an even better character in Ignite Me. Finding out Warner and Adam were brothers: My mind was just COMPLETELY blown. Overall, this book was a very pleasant read! I found myself picking it up to read, even when it was 12 at night and I had exams early the next day. It played out like a movie in my head but it felt real. Tahereh Mafis writing just feels so raw and real, and this really immerses you into the plot and the emotions the characters feel. I would really like to hopefully see a development of Warner and Juliettes relationship in the second book. Warner, overall, is a very interesting character and the concepts of second chances and hope have been played with near the end of this book. Hopefully we can see that occur in the next and last installment of the trilogy. How I feel right now:
Miranda has once again proven herself to be among the stars of the contemporary YA genre with her newest book, THINGS I CANT FORGET. While CATCHING JORDAN will probably always be my favorite of hers, I think THINGS I CANT FORGET gave it a run for its money, especially in the guy department! The storyline is heartbreaking and yet seductive at the same time, making for one heck of a ride for the reader. There are many things I wont be able to forget about this book! Kate is the epitome of a good girl in every single aspect. She never misses a day of church, doesnt act out in any way, and dresses modestly. I thought it would drive me crazy but Miranda somehow makes it work. Kate may seem perfect on the outside, but she has a lot of inner turmoil to deal with. One of these things she has to conquer is her guilt that she aided her best friend in getting an abortion. This is a very touchy subject among basically everyone in this society, but I think Miranda handles it very well. Another problem Kate has to work through is her relationship with God and what it means for her when she begins to have something very special blossom with Matt, the love interest. It isnt an easy journey for Kate in any way, but I was beaming for her by the end of the book! Fans of Catching Jordan must know that I think that Matt rivals Sam Henry. He is extremely realistic, sweet, gorgeous, funny, and an allaround awesome guy who I wish was real! On top of that, hes a long distance runner training to run a marathon barefoot. Adorable and hot! Matt and Kates relationship also happens to be one of the sweetest and spiciest romances Ive had the pleasure of reading about in YA. One moment they are innocently flirting, the next they arent able to keep their hands off each other. Make sure you have a fan nearby when opening THINGS I CANT FORGET. Youre going to need it! One thing I love the most about Miranda Kenneallys book is that she doesnt slack on the character or plot development. I came to adore some of the secondary characters like Ian and Eric, yet also felt extreme anger at Megan. Kates friends and enemies were mine, too! And the plot. Oh, wow, the plot. Abortion and religion are very difficult subjects to tackle in any area, but they are handled beautifully in THINGS I CANT FORGET. Its not at all preachy or too much to handle. Kate has to acknowledge her role in both before she finds the person she is and the one she is meant to be. I dont think Kenneally could have executed it any better than she did by the end. THINGS I CANT FORGET is most definitely one book that I will be rereading over and over again in the future. Readers will be laughing and crying and laughing some more right alongside Kate and Matt on their journey of selfdiscovery.
I received this book to review for the ReadItReap program in the group ShutUpRead. Thanks to the mods and author for providing this book for us to read. This book wasnt the most terrible one Ive ever read, or even close to that. I just feel there are so much more negative things to say than positive, and that makes me sad. Our heroine is a sixteen year old girl named Mercy Moore. She attempts her first kiss with Paul, and during the kiss she almost kills him. She soon finds out she is half succubus, so naturally there is a collection of boys falling all over her. A lot of things confused me, but they were explained more properly at the end. I just really struggled to get there. I didnt like Mercy that much. Well, her taste in music was superb, but thats about all. At first she started out as a girl who wanted to be part of the Elites, and at that point she was relatable and almost likeable. Then she just did so many stupid things. Also, I think I could have liked her more if at ANY point in this book she took a step back and said what the hell is going on? She was absolutely clueless. I know thats not her fault, but she should have demanded more from her mother. Flynn had some decent character development throughout the book, but hes probably the only character I felt anything for. I dont have to like every character I read about, but if Im constantly feeling the need to shake some sense into the heroine who I think was supposed to be fairly intelligent it makes for a less enjoyable reading experience. Okay, so I have to talk about the love pentagon. A triangle is fine, really. The idea to have 4 guys constantly obsessed with Mercy half succubus or not was just too much for me. Sorry. I understand completely what the author wanted to do, but at a certain point I was just like ...Can we chill with this for a minute?! Now onto what I did like. The story was very different from any other stories I have read. It does have originality and creativity. I also liked the vocabulary words! This book had a great start, actually, but then it dragged and annoyed me. In my opinion the Cambion series does have potential, but definitely has room for improvement. I personally am not interested in reading the next part, unfortunately. Many other people have given this book good reviews, so maybe it just wasnt for me. 35 Stars
Nothing in my life has ever felt so good yet hurt so achingly bad. This was my first CoHo book and it was simply magical. I thought Colleen Hoovers writing was flawless. The story was told at the perfect pace and all the characters were wonderful. Let me start by saying Im not a fan of love triangles. I try to avoid them as much as possible, but boy am I glad I stuck with this to the very end. This is a MUSTREAD novel. I also highly recommend purchasing the album by Griffin Peterson that accompanies the book. I had what felt like a 4D reading experience! Not to mention, the songs are beautiful and adds so much more to the story. Desire is easy to fight. Especially when the only weapon desire possesses is attraction. Its not so easy when youre trying to win a war against the heart. Maybe Someday is a heartachingly emotional story that revolves around Sydney and Ridge. They lived in apartments that were situated right across a courtyard from each other. Every night at 8pm Sydney would sit out on her balcony and listen in on Ridge playing his guitar. Ridge is an extremely talented musician who writes songs for his brothers band. Unfortunately, hes been experiencing writers block. Fortunately for him, Sydney has been creating her own lyrics to his songs.After finding out that her boyfriend has been cheating on her, Sydney moves in with Ridge and his roommates, Warren and Bridgette. The secondary characters in this book are fantastic! Warren, Ridges best friend, was by far my favorite character. He was funny, he was caring and he was loveable. The lengths he would go for Ridge was admirable and just made me fall for him bad. Ive learned that the heart cant be told when and who and how it should love. The heart does whatever the hell it wants to do. I dont want to say much about Sydney and Ridge because really, its complicated. They were meant to be together. They both breathed music and every time they wrote music together my heart sang. When it came around to them writing Maybe Someday, I cried. There was just so much emotion in that scene. And even though I felt what Ridge does was wrong, I cant bring myself to not love the guy. He couldnt help it and I felt his decision near the end showed how hard he was trying to keep things the way they are even if his choice crushed my heart into pieces. As long as hes a part of it, Ill never live a life of mediocrity. My life with Ridge will be nothing short of remarkable. Its official, Im a Colleen Hoover fan!
This book deserves an extra star... Read the full review at The Fairytale Nerd. Jem is my book bofriend! Read about it HERE. LOVE: I loved that EVERY character in this book is very interesting. Each of them has a story to tell. Together, those stories were weaved by Cassandra Clara into a very colorful tapestry. I was amazed at how everything was connected. I was awed by Will and Jems friendship. They are not merely best friends. In this book, I learned the true meaning of parabatai. Truly, they can be considered blood brothers. They care deeply for each other, and are ready to make huge sacrifices for one another. A beautiful thing, really. The two boys are complete opposites of each other, but I can see now why Tessa is drawn to both. In this book, a very different side of Will is presented. However, it is Jem who hogged the spotlight. Here, Jem is no longer the the assistant. The reader will see his strength, kindness, and... sexiness masculinity? or dare I say... virility?. NO LOVE: This book is perfect. No complaints. From start to finish, I was engrossed. I loved every word of the sentence of the paragraph of the page of the paper of the fiber of the book. I dont want to praise this book too much  it might seem artificial, but this is probably the best book I have read in 2011. This book is THAT good. Fcking beautiful. No kidding. Come to think of it, there is one thing I hate about this book. That is Will. No... I changed my mind. I love him. No, I hate him. Argh. I cant make up my mind about him! All I know is that the Will from Clockwork Prince is HOThotter than in Clockwork Angel. FAVORITE CHARACTER: Mr. James Carstairs. sigh His humility makes him shine. His goodness makes him lovable. His chivalry makes him sexy. Only Cassandra Clare can make a dying boy sexy. MUSINGS: In Clockwork Angel, I was on Team Will. In this book, I jumped off the Will Wagon, and switched to Team Jem. I fell in love with Jem in this book. Hes everything I want in a book boyfriend. While reading, I noticed that when James Carstairs is not on the scene Im reading, I find myself missing him. But is there really a Team Will, Team Jem in this book? I would have to say NO. There is no teams. There is just pure brotherly love between Jem and Will. What they have is truly a beautiful thing. Theyre willing to make huge sacrifices for each other. I am deeply awed. Now dont ask about Cassandra Clares writing. Its a given that its flawless. That is something natural for Clares works. But I have to say that out of all the Cassandra Clare books I have read, this one tops it all. Yes, that includes The Mortal Instruments. And the sexy duo that is Will and Jem is up, up up there with Jace Wayland.
Actual rating 4.5 stars. These Broken Stars follows Lilac and Tarver. Lilac is the daughter of the richest man in the galaxy and Tarver is a decorated war hero. The ship theyre traveling on is pulled out of hyperspace and crash lands on a planet, Lilac and Tarver must band together in hopes of survival. I went into These Broken Stars expecting a space adventure, but got something completely different. Almost the entirety of the books follows Lilac and Tarver as they fight for survival on a foreign planet. This book has an incredibly slow pace. There are moments when action is happening but the pace stays relatively consistent throughout. The slow pace matches the story completely. This isnt an action packed space adventure, this is a character driven story about two people surviving and coming to a better understanding of themselves. The writing styles reads as if only one author wrote the story. There isnt any passage or section that feels different from the rest of the story since the authors writing style mesh cohesively. I thought the inclusion of bits of conversations between Tarver and some unknown at the end of each chapter was brilliant. It gives enough information to keep the reader guessing, but not enough information to give any sort of clue as to whats going to happen in the future. Lilac goes through a lot of changes. The Lilac at the beginning of the story is not the same Lilac at the end. I found her incredibly annoying until about halfway through the book. She goes through such dramatic changes that it was fun to see such an entitled girl go from annoying and bratty to someone who is grounded in understanding of themselves and whats happening around them. What I liked most about Tarver was the authors choice to not make Lilac dependent on him. She is dependent on him in certain ways survival, etc., but instead of Tarver doing everything for her he pushes her. He pushes her to keep going, he pushes her to find that fight for survival within her, etc. Watching them interact with each other throughout the book was hilarious at some points and fascinating at others. As Lilac and Tarver change so does their relationship with each other. The only thing that I did not enjoy about this book was the ending. I wish the ending was expanded on more because I felt like it was rushed. Overall, I thought this was a very interesting and enjoyable read. The mystery and survival components of this book were well crafted and executed in a cohesive fashion. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys scifi.
Thanks to all that I connected with this year! I met a lot of wonderful people who have turned me on to some really great books. I love reading all the great reviews of books I would not otherwise consider and end up loving some of those books. I look forward to reading more reviews by everyone in GR in 2017. I think its safe to say I will not finish any more books by the end of the year. Plans had to be completely rearranged so no reading now boo!. So here is my list for the year. I have read more books this year than ever before. Im a huge cookbook junkie but cut down slightly on that to listen to audio books. This was the year of audio books for me. I worked my library like crazy this year and discovered all the wonderful features of Overdrive yes, I now listen in my car and soon to listen on my walks. Top reads of the year: Just Kids Tuesday Nights in 1980 Homegoing All the Light We Cannot See The Pecan Man Book I was most shocked to love so much: A Taste for Monsters Best cookbooks that I read and cooked from this year: The Superfun Times Vegan Holiday Cookbook Minimalist Bakers Everyday Cooking: 101 Entirely Plantbased, Mostly GlutenFree, Easy and Delicious Recipes Note: I read a lot of cookbooks. Many I dont track or review. The above are ones I really liked and made quite a number of recipes from and continue to use. Best audio narrations: Brown Girl Dreaming Just Kids The Pecan Man A Taste for Monsters To Kill a Mockingbird The Last Painting of Sara de Vos Note: I loved the narration of this one more than the actual story if that makes sense. Edoardo Ballerini is an amazing narrator. Im listening to The House at the Edge of Night, in which he narrates, and Im sure it would also make my tops list if I could finish it this year. I would seek out books just that he narrates. Best reread of a favorite: To Kill a Mockingbird Note: Favorite book of all time. I wanted to try the audio and was not disappointed. Narrated by Sissy Spacek that does an amazing job. I will rotate between print and audio on this beloved classic in the future.
 Its raining men Hallelujah its raining men, Amen Its raining men Hallelujah its raining men, Amen I was overjoyed with the abundance of gorgeous boys on this book and when I say gorgeous I mean it in a suddenlymypantieswanttodrop kind of way. Miss Dodd did it again. She was able to create another perfect boynextdoorBFF characters remember Phillip and Danny?. And in this book, they come in full force. But then again, I expected nothing less from Miss Dodd. Our heroin Keatyn is very relatable. I love that she is acting like her age. She wishes what everyone of us want to have when we were of her age fame, popularity, adoration and a perfect boyfriend. I love that just like a regular teen, she always feels that her every crush and infatuation is her one true love. She falls inlove just as fast as she gets her heart broken. : She likes to have fun and she likes to dress up. She is just like every young girl there is. Confused and still trying to figure our who she wants to be. Okay she is ALMOST like an ordinary young lady if not for her Hollywood star parents. : Also, I feel that if ever Jadyn will get to meet Keatyn, they will be instant BFFs. Keatyn will no longer have a problem in finding true girlfriend. See, Jadyn also rhymes with Keatyn. : And then there is our swarm of delicious guys. There were just too much that I felt like I am in heaven. And the most fun part of this heaven is that although the boys have different personalities from sweet to cringeworthy, they have their gorgeous face and bodies as their common denominator. No wonder Keatyn had a very very difficult time choosing between them. We are only in Book 1 and yet we have 9 insanely hot guys taking rounds on this book. Oh wait I forgot to add some more. We also have Keatyns stepdad I forgot his name, theres also Vincent. And yes even Keatyns dad used to be a model so Im guessing that he was also beautiful. It really is raining men in this book. : Stalk Me, although there is a chaos of characters there is just a lot that I have to go back and get their names every now and then, is a fun and colorful one. It has a bit of everything. It made me smile, laugh, swoon, it gave me butterflies, it broke my heart, it made me cry and it made me shout and root for Keatyn. I am so excited to read all of the books from this series and walk with Keatyn in her journey of self discovery. I want to be there when she finally finds the one. : I wonder if we already met him or if he is yet to be introduced to us.
Quick Review: Wow. Just wow! Im absolutely floored by the brilliantly crafted story of The Girl From Everywhere. My favorite part of the novel is a threeway tie between the aesthetic setting, so perfectly captured in both feel and culture, the relationship between Nix and her father, and the premise of time travel in association with the maps. Overall this book is truly something special and should definitely be a book you check out. Full Review: Let me start by saying what a brilliant author Heidi is. Not only is her story engaging, but her meticulous planning and artful weaving of the plot leaves my mind blown with all expectations hit out of the proverbial park. Paradise is a promise no god bothers to keep. Theres only now, and tomorrow nothing will be the same, whether we like it or not. The majority of this book takes place in late 1800s Hawaii, and I love how well Heidi captures the vibes and feel of the paradisiacal island of Oahu. Her descriptions and tenderness towards the setting has me anxious to visit and feel and experience everything just as these characters did. I also really appreciated how Heidi captured the turning point where Hawaii lost more of its Hawaiian charm, culture, and authenticity and became overrun by foreign influence. Its a sad and tragic past, but someone has to tell it. So often its written off as inconsequential, but Hawaii was annexed and diminished from its natural peacefulness in such a horrid way. The main character, Nix is really intuitive and easy to relate to. She struggles with her warring desires and her idea of home and family. Slate, her father, is quite an enigmatic and complex person. I loved his development in the book. Kashmir is dashing and the wittiest comic relief. The secondary characters were fleshed out and each had their own respective backstories. Mostly everyone was likable too. One of my favorite parts of the book was the evolving relationship between Nix and Slate. Slates monomaniacal obsession with saving Nixs mother in the past really fractured any genuine fatherdaughter relationship. I loved seeing their relationship grow, and my favorite scene in the whole novel happens between these two. The romance in this book is kept to a minimum and although it looks like there might be a love triangle forming, its hardly there at all and wont overshadow the plot or your love for the book. Also this is a duology, so everything will develop and sort itself out in the next book. I was hooked on this book immediately from the beginning. The idea of this story is so well developed and explained. It was fascinating learning about the time travel and the importance of maps. I love how Heidi mixed various fantasymyth and historical elements into her story. We get to read of places and elements were familiar with and other creatures and destinations that are innovative creations. Some parts were a bit confusing at times with the time travel, but everything happens for a reason, and all is revealed by the end. There are so many unexpected events in this novel; the unpredictability of this adventure novel was a definite hit for me. I also love the incorporation of diverse cultures placed in the novel. This book could read as a standalone, but theres one more book to give us another amazing adventure with this great cast of characters and a phenomenal author. I cant recommend this book enough!
5 beautiful, heartwrenching stars!! Jessica Park has a huge fan for life. I actually heard of Left Drowning by Jessicas facebook page, she was upset over some of the reviews that had come through so of course when I saw it was available on Netgalley to request, I hit that magic button to request it. When I got the email from Net Galley telling me my request was approved, I moved all other books to the side so I could start it. And just let me say, I am so glad I did!! The dedication alone was beautiful: This book is for everyone who has survived. You are not broken. You can love and be loved, despite what may feel like the eternally brutal nature of the world. Even when youre drowning and so far under, there is always time to reach for someone who will teach you how to breathe again. The story starts off with Blythe, who is at a point in her life where she is left drowning. She isnt really living, she is surviving, but just barely. Then enters Sabin, the flamboyant, wise cracking, life of the party, lovable guy. He sets a spark off in Blythe that she hadnt felt for a long time, which causes her to do something she hadnt done since she has been in college. She goes to the lake, and this is where we are introduced to Christopher, and I instantly knew that I was going to love this one. We find out soon, that Sabin turns out to be Chris brother and then we are introduced to the rest of the Shepherd siblings. I love how close all of them are, and how they take Blythe into their family circle is so heart warming. Chris and Blythe have this connection but Chris seems intent on fighting it. And Blythe is happy to stay put as long as he stays in her life. Some people believe in God; I believe in Chris As Chris and Blythes relationship goes to the next level, we get to see them fall in love, but we also see Chris start to pull away. He helped Blythe deal with her demons of the past, but he has no desire to look back and deal with his. That part of my life is over. I will not look back. This is where my heart broke. Yes it fucking broke! When you finally get the whole story, you will be in tears, just to warn you. Blythe and Christophers story is one you will want to read. This is going in my favorites shelf, and I want to scream to the rooftops for everyone to read it. Which I will on release day, which happens to be very soon, July 16th. I am putting the link for preorder with my review, and I suggest you preorder this title so its ready to read as soon as its available. 
For eight years I dreamed of fire. Trees ignited as I passed them; oceans burned. The sugary smoke settled in my hair as I slept, the scent like a cloud left on my pillow as I rose. Even so, the moment my mattress started to burn, I bolted awake. The sharp, chemical smell was nothing like the hazy syrup of my dreams; the two were as different as Indian and Carolina jasmine, separation and attachment. They could not be confused. Standing in the middle of the room, I located the source of the fire. A neat row of wooden matches lined the foot of the bed. They ignited, one after the next, a glowing picket fence across the piped edging. Watching them light, I felt a terror unequal to the size of the flickering flames, and for a paralyzing moment I was ten years old again, desperate and hopeful in a way I had never been before and would never be again. But the bare synthetic mattress did not ignite like the thistle had in late October. It smoldered, and then the fire went out. It was my eighteenth birthday. And so begins The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh, and I am awake until the early morning hours because I cant bring myself to stop reading. It is only when I hear my husbands alarm, at three in the morning, that I realize how much time has passed. I force myself to sleep, so I can wake up and finish. When I do, I close the book, and think it was a novel I wish I had written. Victoria Jones, the protagonist, is at once haunting, engaging and achingly real. Flashbacks to her tenyearold self in the foster care system break you open. At eighteen, she is released from the system and begins to make her way through the world. Its not pretty...shes distrusting, hesitant, and awkward. Yet, she communicates through her extensive knowledge of flowers, their meaning, their ability to reflect feelings and emotions. I found myself, at points, exhausted from pulling for her and urging her on because for a woman who can see with such deep clarity into others, she remains an enigma to herself. She makes a sacrifice that, as a mother myself, I found sacrificial and so reflective of her hesitancy to allow herself to feel deeply for another human being after her own experiences. I hesitate to reveal too much in this review because what I loved about this novel was its surprising twists and discoveries. It was unlike anything I had ever read, and I only wish I could read it again for the first time. Dont just read this novel. Savor it.
There is not too much that I can say about this book that hasnt been said before. An instant best seller, still 8 on the New York Times Best Seller List almost a year and a half after it was published, and the winner more awards that I can count  including the Pulitzer Prize and the Goodreads Choice Awards to name a few. This novel is essentially about childhood and war and growing up in a world torn by war. MarieLaure lives with her father in Paris. When she was six years old, she became blind and her father teaches her to learn to navigate the streets by building her an exact replica of their neighborhood. She is twelve years old when the Nazis occupy France and her and her father flee to the country to live with MarieLaures greatuncle for the remainder of the war. Werner is an orphan growing up in a small mining town in Germany. He grows up with his young sister listening to the radio and dreaming of bigger and greater things than spending the remainder of his life as a minor. When the Nazis begin to recruit for the Hitler Youth, Werner sees this as his only opportunity out. He quickly gains a reputation as being the only one who can fix new instruments critical in the advancement of the Nazis. As he receives one special assignment after another, Werner slowly realizes that cost that his work has on human life. Work that will also one day lead him to MarieLaure. All the Light We Cannot See is a beautiful story of two children who grow up during the war. Two children that grow up during unspeakable times having to make unspeakable decisions way beyond their years. The novel alternates between MarieLaure in very short chapters, making the almost 600page novel go by much faster than expected. The imagery was wonderful and was, essentially, what makes this book such a masterpiece. It was also what made it hard for me to rate this book as amazing instead of simply wonderful. The writing was almost too beautiful  I kept thinking that I was missing something. It was almost like reading literate poetry. Breathtakingly beautiful, but a little hard to follow throughout an entire novel. Especially since the chapters were so short and the development of each characters story was woven to intricately with the other. I did really enjoy this book, but I dont think I was able to appreciate it in its entirety. I tend to read way to fast and so I wasnt able to grasp as much of the detail as I would have liked. I think this may be one of the few books that I will have to reread someday! See my review and others here: 
She was left drowning to the tragic memory of her parents. He was left drowning to the tragic memory his past. And they were both struggling to breathe... Would you all consider me a loser if I tell you I dont know how to skip stones? Its really a shame that I ever really learned how to do it despite my yearly visit to beaches every summer. However, this book gives a chapter that I liked to call The Skipping Stone Tutorial this is a chapter where you would learn how to do it with a very hot guy as your personal tutor. Hmm.. Are you now interested to learn? wink Left Drowning provoked a good and strong sense of emotional surge in me. I really appreciate the authors way to convey a story with a strong emotional pull. I felt each and every emotional journey of the characters  from soaring heights of love, grief, loss and eventually healing. Im not really one of those who are in too overly dramatic and angsty stories and I actually thought this story might be in that page but I was surprised that despite those being present the overall writing makes up for it. Somehow, reading this reminds me as I was reading Hopeless. Why? Well, maybe because I was left on the edge of my seat waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting and predicting for something to happen. The characters  Blythe, Chris, Sabin, James, Estelle and Eric are all each part of the puzzle that makes up this story. Each of them has their own distinct qualities but despite all that they have one common thing  they were all messed up. The story shows how each of them coped with their haunting pasts. They were absolutely flawed in the most perfect way. There are no words to describe my love for the Shepherd siblings! Estelle and her beauty and assurance and confidence and of course her giant purse that I wanted to steal, Erik with his silent but heartwarming gestures and Sabin with his exuberance and charm. I know Im not the only one but Sabin is the one that definitely left a great mark on me. From the first moment he stole Blythes coffee all through the hard parts of the story. I wanted to have him as my best friend! I really really liked the fact that hes the best friend of Blythe here and lets all be honest its not always that we get the girlandboy best friend relationship that are plain platonic. Its like a breath of fresh air. I admit I was frustrated most of the time with Chris and Blythes crazy relationship  with their on and off scheme add up to this are the ridiculous decisions that the characters made and the never ending uncertainties and miscommunications. But the very most redeeming this about these frustrations is that it makes the ending all worth while. And let me say this for once: Every coincidence that happened on this book are freakin awesome! I might have predicted a thing or two of the secrets and revelations but it still surprised me at the end. Everything was nicely packed at the end  every connection and revelations were brilliantly written. It was a beautifully told story. From the notsoperfect characters and everything that went along with it. The twisting journey of frustration is definitely worth it!
This review originally posted at Christas Hooked on Books Every so often a book comes along that is so amazing that you want walk around thrusting it into everyones hands. The Night Circus is one of those books. I want to go around and convince everyone they should read this book  friends, family members, complete strangers on the subway. The story is one of two young magicians  Celia and Marco. As children their eccentric guardians binded them together in a life long duel. As they aged, unbeknownst to them, their duel encompassed all that they did and all those that they knew. Their stage was the Night Circus. A mysterious and magical circus that traveled the world and only opened after dark. Everything has been set up perfectly but their was one thing their guardians could have never expected.  that Celia and Marco would fall head over heels in love. Everything about this book is absolutely beautiful. There is no place that sounds more magical and more enchanting than the Night Circus. Erin Morgenstern has really drawn on all your senses when crafting this beautiful setting. It really feels like you are right in the middle of the circus. If you close your eyes you can picture the gorgeous black tents, the smell of the concessions, the sense of awe that would radiate through the crowds. In addition the setting it is also completely effortless to fall in love with the characters. Just like the circus themselves they all exude magic and mystery. Celia is particular is my favourite. As the circus illusionist and a true magician there is never a dull moment. She has an absolutely charming personality and she is the definition of a pure character  guided by love and dedicated to the Circus and all who reside within it. I found the relationship between her and Marco inspiring. All odds were against them and it thrived despite everything their guardians did to stop it. This is one of the most beautiful books that I have ever read. I got so swept up in the story and the characters and the setting that I missed my subway stop...twice. Erin Morgensterns skillful writing will transport you to a world you never imagined existed. Sure youve been to the circus before, but theres never been a circus like this one. The magic and mystery isnt just brought into the circus, its woven into every tent, every piece of popcorn every spark of the bonfire.
Thoughts on the Overall Book: Ive really enjoyed this series from the beginning, and this book was no exception. I continue to love the cast of characters and the new additions and this one particularly had a very classic adventure flair to it. CoverYea or Nay: I love the covers for this series, so pretty yet simple. Characters: I still loved all the characters I liked previously, Cinder is still awesome, Iko is adorable definitely my favorite android character ever and though Scarlet and Wolf werent in this one quite as much, I still really love them too. Thorne is fast becoming my favorite character, probably. I cant resist loving the characters who are rogues yet still good men. I also really loved Cress, I felt she was a good edition to the group. Since Cinder and Scarlet are two pretty prominent heroines, I liked how Cress is more shy and sweet but still very skilled in hacking and shes strong enough to step up to the plate when she needs to. Lavina is still evil, and Sybil was fun to hate as well. I was interested with the introduction of Winter in this one, I really have no idea what to think of her yet, but I know shes going to make an awesome character. The Romance: Okay, yes, there is essentially instalove between Thorne and Cress, or at least on Cresss end, but it actually works here, because its more fanciful than anything, and shes kind of naive and hasnt had a lot of human interaction. It didnt bother me. Apart from that, really not much romance to speak of. This one was mostly action packed. But I did really end up enjoying Thorne and Cresss relationship and I think its cute. I was happy Kai and Cinder seemed to have reconciled at the end of the book too. I look forward to seeing them working together from now on. Writing Style: Same as the other books. Love the world building, and how the story is evenly balanced between characters and their development and storylines and the plotlines. It makes for an engaging read, and even though the book is long, it doesnt seem to drag. Accuracy Believability: Despite being scifi, I actually to think that the situations of the story are pretty accurate to how they would really happen. Its a pretty well thought out plot for a scifi novel. ProblemsWhat bothered me: Really didnt have any problems, I enjoyed the book. Conclusion: 4 of 5 stars. Really enjoyed this one, and am very much looking forward to the next one! Cant wait! Recommended Audience: Readers of the first two, obviously. I dont read a lot of scifi, so I dont know a lot of recs, but if you love fairy tale retellings and want something different, these work. Girl or guy read ages 16 and up.
What a shocker! Anything to do with the Maddoxes is never boring. Ok, Im going to have to do this review all back to front because I have to start off talking about that ending. What the heck was that? Throughout the whole book there is a mystery surrounding TJ, Camis boyfriend, and I for one had no clue what it was. I mean really, I just couldnt for the life of me work it out. Well, when we finally get to the end and it is revealed, I couldnt have been more shocked. I really felt as though it didnt even make sense. I had to speak to someone straight away, who had read the book, just to make sure I wasnt going crazy. Nope, turns out I wasnt going crazy, it really was just something so crazy. I now feel like I need to go back and reread the whole thing with my new information. Crazy. Anyway, back to the story.. It was good, great even. As with Beautiful Disaster it didnt take me long before I was hooked. Theres just something about those Maddox boys.. I love to read about them and see their cheeky ways. If Im honest, I really didnt love Trenton as much as I did Travis, but thats no shock to me really. I think Travis us unbeatable. My issue with Trenton was mainly that I found him to be a little too on the soppy side. I dont mind a guy being in touch with his feelings, but at the same time I still want him to have that bad boy edge. With Trenton I felt like he was too much. He made me cringe at times and thats never a good sign. Still, I wouldnt have said no.. ha. I was just thinking now was as good a time as any to acknowledge that youre perfect and it wouldnt suck if you fell madly in love with me any time soon. As for Cami, I liked her the whole way through the story, until the end. Like I already said, the big revelation really through me for a loop and to be honest, any likeness I felt towards Cami just kind of vanished. I lost respect for her and I didnt like her so much any more. If it wasnt for this twist, Id still be a fan, but that twist really ruined all sorts of things for me. Overall, I enjoyed the story, like I thought I would, but the ending ruined it for me. If it wasnt for that I would probably be giving it 5 stars too. I know many people saw the ending coming, but for me it just came so out of the blue and left me with a sour taste over the whole thing. Ah well, I look forward to the next one and hopefully that will make it all okay..
I loved Law of Moses. I loved the flow and the beautiful writing and wonderful characters. This is Tags story David Taggert. Tag is Moses best friend. I really enjoyed the originality of the 1st person POV of Tag AND Moses. I usually dont like the back and forth in time, but in this case, I learned to like it. The Chapter labels helped tremendously. Going back in time was only a matter of 2 or 3 weeks. Tags POV was mostly his narrative on cassette tapes. Moses POV was usually present time. In Law of Moses, it had the feel of a YA, but heavier. Moses and Georgia were younger. Now in The Song of David, theyre all a few years older and have their careers. Georgia working with her horses, and being a mom; Moses still painting his images and being a dad; and Tag, running his Gym and his bar. Amelie Millie works as a pole dancer at Tags bar. She has a younger brother, Henry. Millie has been blind since the age of 11. She lives with her brother Henry in a house financed by their long estranged father. Henry is autistic but is never labeled that in the book. Henry really steals every scene that hes in. I love the relationship between Millie and Henry. And I love how loving and protective Tag is towards Millie and Henry. He shows this in different ways, of course. I love Henry! I cant say too much more, since it would spoil it. The evolving love story between Millie and Tag is very gradual and tentative, especially on Tags part. I love how he thinks of Millie as his friend. He doesnt even see it coming! The majority of the book is Millie and Moses listening to Tags journalstyle tapes from the weeks prior. Theyre trying figure out why Tag left and where to find him. The moment of discovery is heart wrenching. How it was handled from that point, thankfully wasnt predictable to me. Millie shows her true strength throughout the story, but she especially shows her tremendous strength at this point, Getting Tag to recognize Millies and his own strength is key. The ending, in my opinion, is just as unique as the entire book. This book and The Law of Moses are rare emotional reads that I will want to reread. I know that I will. This is some book to think about and discuss and think about some more. I REALLY recommend reading The Law of Moses first. 4.75 stars!
I loved Torn Hearts. It was supposed to be a simple story for me... a bridge between Kaleidoscope Hearts and Paper Hearts. I was so wrong. Mia and Jensens story was far from simple. It was young love at its purest. It was love despite one troubled young man falling for the rich girl beyond his reach. Mia and Jensen were friends first and that makes love that much sweeter. Still, words are easy. Its the actions that can destroy something so miraculous. It was Jensens actions that left Mia with a broken heart and Mias lack of support that left Jensen angry. By the end of Torn Hearts, I wanted to hate Jensen but I knew by the end of Paper Hearts I would applaud him. As I read the last words of Claires amazing story of second chances, validation and redemption  and with the ugliest tears ever running down my face, applaud him is exactly what I did. Even after five years apart, Jensen could never let Mia go. For five years she ignored him and ran in the other direction when he came back into town to visit. Even though they had both moved on with their lives and had other relationships, Mia and Jensen still had a bond that Jensen would give anything to strengthen. He still wanted her. He still wrote about her. She was still his muse. She would always be his inspiration. But when a second chance presented itself in the form of a job where the talented photographer had to work with the inspiring writer, Jensen refused to let Mia continue to be the one that got away. I admired Mia for sticking to her plans to not have her heart broken by Jensen. Still thhings had changed in five years. Jensen had changed. Surely she couldnt open her heart to him again  only to have it smashed to bits one more time? She couldnt be sure that he meant what he said or if she was simply responding to their incredible chemistry. What would it matter if she gave into the physical? It meant nothing. Right? Claire Contreras has written one of the most thought provoking, emotionally moving, heartbreaking but soul mending stories I have read this year. Jensen was gentle but determined, sexy and brooding... down right swoony. He was applause worthy. Mia was broken but a fighter, beautiful inside and out. Troubled and insecure. She made my heart ache on one page only to make me cheer on another. I so very highly recommend that you read this absolutely fantastic story. Congratulations, Claire, on a great book! Real love stories never end.
First of all, Libby if youre reading this, THANK YOUUUU!!!!! for sending this to me!!! it definitely found a loving home!!!! This is honestly more of a 4.75 stars, but my issues with it are so minor that im giving it the credit it deserves and im sticking with five stars. Sarah J Maas is just incredible at writing new worlds with strange creatures. This book is written so nicely and descriptively, and that drew me in from the very first page. However, Im sure a lot of you might be able to relate, once you start reading a lot of Sarahs writing, you start to pick up on the phrases she overuses, such as he loosed a breath and his eyes were lined in silver and little descriptions like that. Very minor thing, but it grows irritating after you notice it for the tenth time in one book. Feyre is an incredible character who is the perfect balance of sassy and frail. I liked her more than Celaena in book 1 of the TOG series. Going into this, I had heard so many great things about Rhysand that I didnt even pay attention to Lucien and Tamlin, so it was a pleasant surprise whenever the romance got introduced in this book and I loved it soooo much. I like that this book is a little bit more sexy than her other series; it added a really nice edge and I had to set the book down a couple of times to compose myself because it gave me so many feels. I stayed up until 4 AM this morning to read this because it got SO. ADDICTING. I super duper duper loved the story and the way it was written and the world, but found toward the end that the plot was just a little disappointing. Its a beauty  the beast retelling, but in my opinion, it mirrored the original storyline a little too closely. It was predictable. I was surprised at the little twists at the end, yet in the back of my mind I knew how everything would end. I wish the plot hadnt been so straightforward. In Throne of Glass I guess Im just used to the events being drawn out longer, so that might be why this feels weird to have a real resolution, but nevertheless the ending makes me slightly disappointed for reasons I cant quite place, even though it ends in a great place where this book could even be considered a standalone if you wanted to stop here. I would recommend checking this out, and Ill most likely pick up the sequel, even though I have no clue howwhere the plot will progress?? time to go look up a synopsis.
It is really hard to compartmentalize all that is The Fault in Our Stars, with its sophisticated writing, witty dialogue, deep themes, heartfelt love story, and the amazing characters; I fell in love with it. I was really hoping that John Green and his novel was not just another overhyped book, and I am happy to say that it was not. It is extremely worth all of the hype surrounding it and then some. I think that this book will soon become a classic and has the power to change readers lives. Yes, this book is that amazing. This book brought forth feelings from me that I have never felt reading a book before and it is now categorized as one of my favorite books. The writing in this book is superb. With its witty and sarcastic humor, I found myself regularly laughing. I feel that the writing in this book is advanced for a Young Adult book, not in the way that a teenager is unable to read it, just in the fact that it is incredibly smart and full of deep themes. I felt like, although the love story was great, that the other messages in this book were very important. I loved that this book explored the fear of being forgotten after death and urged the importance of living life to its fullest because no one knows when it will be their time to die. I feel like this book is very relatable to everyone, even individuals who have never been affected by cancer, because it discusses fears that every human has. I also liked the statement that pain needs to be felt because everyone must go through some sort of pain in their lifespan, whether it is a loss of a loved one to a bad breakup, its something that we can all relate to. I absolutely loved all the characters and relationships that were in this book. I liked the relationship between Hazel and her parents. As a parent, I cant imagine what it is like to know for a fact that your child will die. I liked that it explored Hazel being afraid that she will ruin her parents lives if she dies and her mother struggling with being protective over her child, but still letting her live her life. I also loved the friendship between Isaac and Augustus, as well as the relationship between Augustus and Hazel. I really enjoyed that Augustus taught Hazel how to live life. PreGus, Hazel just seemed to sit at home and watch ANTM with her parents, not wanting to create relationships with people who might be affected by her death, but Augustus taught Hazel to live life and embrace love. Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone: young or old, female or male, romance reader or not...this book was amazing. Although this book is sad, I also felt like it provided hope and understanding. I will defiantly be picking this book up again...and again...and again.
First off I would like to give my biggest thanks to Feiwl  Friends for sending me this book. I believe this is one of the best books in the history of books, for me its Harry Potter, then its CinderScarletCress. Its just a perfect bled of action, romance, and suspense that when you start it you cant put it down. It took me about four hours to read this five hundred fifty page book. To me all of the characters just seem to be like pieces of a puzzle how they all fit into a perfect place among the others. Getting down to it now. Quick Overview Well in this book Cress is a girl who is a Lunar Shell, rescued from death to work as a hacker to track down Cinder and her crew. But when Cinder contacted her in book one she realizes that she doesnt want Queen Levana to take over Earth. So instead she helps the crew from her satellite tower. When she finally contacts them for help everything goes awry. Now theyre all split up, Scarlet has been captured, Throne and Cress are on her falling satellite, then Cinder is left with an injured wolf on a stolen ship on her way to find Dr. Erland. You follow three different stories and around seven different views, not all of them consistent. Favorite Characters Captain Carswell Thorne. He is funny, Charming, and just awesome. He is the flirt of the team that every book just has to have. It was like the author read my mind, he did almost everything I wanted him to in Cress and it was awesome. Romance Well there is the obvious couple Wolf and Scarlet. Then there is the fighting romance between Kai and Cinder. Then there is a new couple in this book, but I wont tell. I think the blend of people and romance is just perfect and I love it and so does every other person I know who has read these books. Action The action is something that really is suspenseful. Like it comes in the blink of an eye and leaves as quick as that. But in the brief moment so much happens that you freak out. If you havent started reading this series, DO IT NOW!! If you have, you will love where this book takes you next! Thanks, Reagan
I cant believe its over... Probably one of the best endings to a series Ive read. Everything tied together so perfectly and I just dont know what Im going to do now that this series is over! I LOVED the fact that we got meet Emma Carstairs and the Blackthorn children in this book. Cassandra Clare is so smart. She knew that if she included them that we would immediately want : Lady Midnight and that we are DYING for this book. At least I am anyway! The six deaths that occurred werent as bad as I anticipated. The first one made me really sad. I loved that character! The way that a certain character dealt with his death after it happened, bothered me a bit. I would explain more but I dont want to give spoilers! And you know what I was really sad when Sebastian died. His last moments were GUTWRENCHING. I thought I would be happy when he died but it was just so sad. Simon. Simon has always annoyed me throughout this series. I know everyone loves him, but Ive never been a fan. However, this book totally changed my opinion about him. Simon has become so brave and so fearless that when he sacrifices something very dear to him, I couldnt help but cry. AND THEN THE FINAL NAME OF HIS BAND?! I started crying all over again! Everyone in this book was awesome. Clary, Jace, Isabelle, Magnus, EVEN ALEC! I loved Alec in this book, he was just hilarious and so sassy with Jace and everyone else. OK ONE MORE THING. THE CAVE SCENE WITH CLARY AND JACE. Very similar to the cave scene in Clockwork Princess in my opinion. I was getting a lot these feelings throughout COHF. Lots of parallels between the two books that I picked up on. I also loved the fact that Cassie connected the two series so well in this last book. THE MENTION OF WILL TORE MY HEART OUT. I love Jem and Im glad he and Tessa are together, but its always going to be Will Herondale for me. I hope one day Cassandra Clare comes out with the future lives of Clary and Jace and everyone else. There would be so many feels. Anyway, this was a wonderful end to a wonderful and amazing series. Im probably going to huddle in a corner rereading my favorite bits from this book and wishing that I could time travel to 2015.
I approached Amy Harmons Infinity  One with equal parts excitement and trepidation; excitement because, having recently read Making Faces by this author, I knew the story would be captivating and beautifully written, and trepidation because, having read the blurb, I incorrectly assumed the narrative would be a retelling of the story of Bonnie and Clyde and had no desire to see the characters meet a similar fate as their predecessors. While the lives of protagonists Bonnie Rae Shelby and Finn Clyde do seem to parallel the lives of the infamous couple in a startling number of ways, theirs is a story of destiny  a story about numbers and music and unlikely matches that make sense against all odds. From her writing, Ive gathered that Amy Harmon is a proponent of the concept of fate  believing that nothing is coincidence and everything happens for a reason  and what fascinated me while reading Infinity  One was pondering the intricacies of how each moment in the narrative is carefully orchestrated to lead to the next. What would the story be without Bonnie and Clyde? From the moment they meet, Bonnie Rae Shelby and Finn Clyde are swept up in a whirlwind, crosscountry adventure. The phrase opposites attract aptly describes the pairing of the bold and brass country singer with the quiet and contemplative math whiz. Bonnie is a walking contradiction  unhappy with her lot in life to the point where she contemplates drastic measures, yet shes practically bursting with liveliness, her energy barely contained by her diminutive body. Conversely, Finn is more reserved, overanalyzing his every word and action. As unlikely as their connection may seem, Bonnie and Finn complement each other, each drawing out the others best qualities, even if it means going outside their comfort zones. I always appreciate when authors take the time to build their characters backstories and identities, which allows me to become more invested in their stories, but Amy Harmon takes this to another level, delving so deep inside the mindsets of her protagonists that they become living, breathing entities. Bonnie and Finn are thoroughly fleshed out, with glimpses of their past revealing the successes and hardships they each endured leading up to the present time. Amy Harmon is a powerfully effective storyteller, baring the souls of her characters by exposing their innermost thoughts, their hopes, and their fears. Every page is a testament to the sheer beauty of the written word, filled with sentences so profound and poetic, you need to read them twice to fully appreciate their meaning. It isnt often that I come across a work of fiction where everything  plot, characters, writing, etc.  aligns to create perfection, but Infinity  One is one such book.
4.5 Stars Passenger is a novel which follows Etta who, one tragic night, finds out that she is a Traveller, someone with the ability to travel through time via various passages. Shes taken back to eighteenth century against her will to meet a man who might help her get back home. On the way she meets Nicholas, captain of the ship shes on. When Etta is forced into a search to find an object lost somewhere in time, Nicholas accompanies her to help and protect her. And as interesting as that sounds, its not what first attracted me to the novel. I was first interested because it has a ship in it th actually boatthings. And after reading and loving Truthwitch, I really wanted something with ships. And though the book is nothing like Truthwitch, Im not at all disappointed because it is really good. It started off with Etta being really excited and nervous about her violin performance. We saw her passion for her music, her relationship with her mother and with her tutor, Alice, all things which turned out to be really important to the story. Then the time travel things happened and shit hit the fan. But Etta managed it wonderfully. I loved Etta, I really did. She was so smart and careful with her actions. She was a great person and very considerate. And she was very strong. Her interaction and her relationship with Nicholas, who I also loved, were beautiful. I loved the romance between the two. It was a very important part of the novel and though Im sometimes bothered when romance takes the front seat in sciencefiction or fantasy, here that was not the case at all. This book was all about saving the people you care about so the romance fit into it seamlessly. The only hiccup I encountered while reading was near the 6570 point when I was getting impatient regarding a revelations and the story had slowed down. It was a portion that wasnt very interesting. But after I pushed through that part, things went swimmingly. This book had a really good plot and pace. It was wellwritten with characters that I both liked and cared about. And now that I know its part of a duology meaning I only have to read one more book to know what happens in the end!, I cant express my joy. I freaking love duologies and Im going to be reading the second book soon. Overall, this was a great book and I highly recommend it.
Review to come after Deweys 24 hour readathon! This made the hours fly! Full review now that Im not a zombie... maybe. Adorable! I like to give constructive criticism and maybe the only thing I can say for this one is that the main character, Lily, doesnt have any self esteem and that seems to be the GO TO thing for YA teens right now. But seriously, this book was so cute and had me on the edge of my seat so much that this bit of criticism is nit picking. The characterization is fantastic. I was actually a bit annoyed with Isabel but their backstory is explained about 34 through the book. It helps the entire story make more sense, and while I sort of guessed, I was not entirely sure where Isabel was coming from. Its just so funny how people always try to match make when someone doesnt have a girlboy friend. Maybe its their choice people!!! I also was able to figure out the note writer but Im pretty sure the author did that on purpose. The clues that were left for the reader were just so well done that they kept me wanting to find out how this was going to work! Unlike a mystery where maybe the clues are there but you dont want to know the killer until nearly the end, knowing the letter writer early on gave its own source of drama. Lily doesnt find out until about halfway through. I actually stopped making notes and highlighting passages at chapter 19. I was way too involved and interested in what was going to happen to even leave a little flag at the important parts! The last portion of this book was my favorite, which is hard to say because I enjoyed every bit of this but the drama that occurs once Lily finds out who is writing her is amazing. It is almost as dramatic as watching a horror, you know something bad is going to happen but not how or when, but that it will. Sometimes authors ratchet up that drama so much that it is hard to read through it but this will keep you glued to your seat. And I read this during Deweys 24 hour readathon so my brain is already fried but I loved every word. I even slowed myself down at the end so it would not come to a stop. Full on love. Heres another author Im going to be stalking! I may have to reread this one soon.
ARC kindly provided by the publishers via Netgalley I just dont even know where to begin this review. I think this is my favorite book by Colleen Hoover. Life is full of maybe somedays Maybe Someday I will be this or that, maybe someday I will stand on my two feet. Maybe someday all of my dreams will come true. At some point in your life you will have said maybe someday. Sydneys maybe someday was heartbreaking, beautiful, and longing. Every emotion that she was feeling was conveyed in just those two simple words. This book is a love triangle, and while I know some people will shy away from it because of that, I need to say I think you need to give it a shot. You wont be disappointed, not in the author, and not in any of the characters. I know. I know, love triangles are horrible. Someone always gets hurt, someone is always the bad guy and it is always, always easy to pick a team. Well, forget all that shit. It does not apply here. Not once was I mad at Sydney or Ridge. Heck, I couldnt even not love Maggie. I fell in love with each and every character in this book, well except Hunter and Tori because they are douchebags. I loved the dual POVs, how seemingly effortless the story flowed and the lyrics. Especially the lyrics. If you loved Colleen Hoovers poems in the Slammed Series then you are going to adore her lyrics. I want these songs now! EVERY.SINGLE.ONE! Sydney is one of my favorite female characters. There isnt even one thing I didnt admire about her. I admired her strength and her right hook : I admired how hard she tried to fight her feelings, how she tries her hardest to not be the girl everyone hates. But not because she didnt want others to hate her. No, because she didnt want to hate herself and become someone she isnt. The relationship between Ridge and Sydney was just simply beautiful. Their friendship was so easy. It just came easy to be themselves. Good or bad. Honest. I love Ridge. I love the relationship he has with Maggie. With Warren. With Sydney. I could probably gush about this book over and over again. But instead I will just say read it for yourself. I laughed. I cried. I fell in love. I got my heartbroken. And then I fell in love even more. I was so sucked into this story that I felt like I was living it. Every emotion or thought Ridge or Sydney had, I did too. I know this review is just gushing but I just cant say more without fear of spoiling. Fall in love with music and everything in between...
The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah may be my favorite novel of 2015... and yes, I realize its only February. Its just that good. The setting is World War II, Nazioccupied France. The story follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, and how they each respond in times of great challenge. Their parallel stories are as different as their personalities, but are just as suspenseful, complicated, and emotional. Although The Nightingale is considered fiction, it is firmly planted in wellresearched truth. Isabelles character is based on the late Andree de Jongh 19162007, an amazing woman who repeatedly risked her life helping British and American servicemen escape on foot from Nazioccupied Belgium and France. You can read more about the woman herself HERE. Sadly, Andree de Jongh is only one of the many quiet heroes that our future generations will likely never know if not for inspired authors like Kristin Hannah. The Nightingale offers a story of women surviving in unthinkable circumstances  the underestimated gender finding a way to take action. It shows readers that at times protectiveness requires dangerous risks, fear often proceeds acts of bravery, and those who may appear weak can indeed possess incredible strength. I didnt want this book to end because its not just about the ravages of war, its also about love, life, and rebellious courage. These women, who had everything and everyone to lose, put it all on the line to help others. I have been spared from the direct horrors of war, but I asked the same question that Ms. Hannah herself asked in an interview about her book, I found myself consumed with a single, overwhelming question, as relevant today as it was seventy years ago: When would I, as a wife and mother, risk my life  and more important, my childs life  to save a stranger? Most of us wouldnt. But which is worst: The fear of the risk or the fear of letting children grow up in a world where good people do nothing to stop evil? I cannot recommend this book highly enough. My favorite quote: If I have learned anything in this long life of mine, it is this: in love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are. Note: Isabelle started out her life as an unruly child, but her tendency to rebel led to great things. If youre raising a hellion yourself, just hang in there  you never know what their independent spirit might develop into!
3.5 stars First thought after finishing this book: WHAT THE HELL? Now heres a little more eloquent review: Going into this book, I was very wary. I didnt have high expectations per se but I was keenly aware of all the buzz that it had been getting and I think that in the end, it definitely didnt disappoint. There isnt really much I can say about We Were Liars . It was a pretty good book: quite wellwritten with an air of suspense that penetrated the whole narrative. In that front, I think the story was executed very aptly. I say pretty good, though, because it didnt really elicit any emotions from me. The characters were fairly enjoyable but not insanely authentic, the plot intriguing but not entirely compelling. A lot of people have been saying that the ending was underwhelming for them but personally, I didnt see it coming at all. On the contrary, I found that the ending was what consolidated this book as a whole and made it a lot more effective in bringing home a message than if it had been something more subdued. I think that if the narrative had followed suit with the ending in terms of impact and unpredictability then the story would have been much stronger. For me, its really important for a book of this genre contemporary mystery? to have a buildup of suspense around this mystery thats just as strong as the unveiling of the mystery itself. Gillian Flynn masters this in her books, although Lockharts attempts were not feeble by any means, just not as well done as her ending. If you couldnt tell already, I really liked the ending, even though it made me quite sad and very very in denial. Its one of those: dammit this is really sad why did you do that to me kind of moments but at the same time a dammit that ending was so well done and made this book stand out so much more. I find myself typing the word good way too often in this review then backspacing it. However, I think that that was what We Were Liars was: good . It wasnt spectacular but I do believe that its worthy of all the praise that its been getting. A solid, quick read with an ending that is definitely not typical to many contemporaries. Thoroughly enjoyed this one!
This book was 486 pages long. This book was NOT long enough. Seriously. Every moment of this book was pure momentum. It made me want more and more from the very first page. And from the first page, Roth kept dishing it out. I couldnt stop and I didnt want to. I am completely and utterly in love with Veronica Roths dystopian society. Not just the writing of it, but what it is. Everyone lives in one of five factions, or segments, of society. Each of these factions having their own way of life based on a character trait that they feel is the most important one to live by. It is virtue in its most extreme manifestation. A virtue, that at age 16, a member of society must figure out where they belong. The whole premise of it is so fascinating to me. The idea that what you believe and how you are able to process life is where you belong. It sounds comforting in a way. It also sounds scary in a way. Whatever faction you choose  that is where you belong and you should never have to question your place in society after you join them. They are supposed to take care of you, you are supposed to be given a role to contribute to society. It makes life sound easy. The society even goes so far as to have the motto Faction over blood. You belong in a faction even more than you belong in a family  afterall, your family may not agree with the same lifestyle as you. But as much as the ideals of the factions  of giving everyone a place in society, of making everyone feel like they fit in somewhere  appealed to me at first, Veronica Roths main character Tris kept showing me how the society doesnt work. Because Tris is Divergent she could fit into more than one faction. Its a dangerous thing. Tris must find out why its dangerous but the more she finds out, the more we realise why the society doesnt work. This is just the beginning. Throughout the book Roth keeps throwing more and more at us. A scary leader, a possible love interest for Tris, tryouts and training, friends, enemies, lots of jumping off tall buildings and walking around dangerous places, characters that need to face their fears, conspiracies, tattoos everywhere, backstabbing, amazing technology, and probably a hundred other things Im forgetting at the moment. The world may be dystopian but its a complicated one. Not just a break down of society, but beyond that, a whole new society. I loved having the insiders look at The Dauntless faction from Beatrices fresh new eyes and hope to see much more of the other factions in the next two series books. My enthusiasm for this book tops almost every other young adult book Ive read this year  matching only Matched by Ally Condie and Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins. Its fast paced, had me from the beginning, there was something magical about it from the first page, and is filled to the brim with discussion worthy, thought provoking ideas. Way to go Veronica! Now, please magically insert Insurgent into my hands  Im waiting...:
This book was SO. BEAUTIFUL. Should I expect anything less from Laini Taylor? It was so very much like Daughter of Smoke and Bone, which I loved so much  beautiful, strange, and enchanting  but also so very different! I highly recommend both of them to anyone and everyone, especially if you love fantasy. First of all, that title! Im going to be honest, I didnt know much at all okay, pretty much nothing except it was by Laini Taylor about this book going in, so I had no idea that the main character is actually named Strange  Lazlo Strange. It completely changes your perspective of the title, I love it! Again, Laini knocked it out of the freaking park with her amazing world and imagination. This book is like nothing I have ever read before, its so unique! I absolutely loved the world of Weep and the intrigue that went with it. The pacing is fairly slow in the beginning, but I was never bored. The mystery of Weep kept me hooked because I was so intrigued about the lost city! Plus Lainis writing is so beautiful that I cant help but bask in her lovely prose no matter what is going on. Its hard to talk about this book without spoilers, so Im going to put most of it in spoiler tags. I wouldnt suggest reading any of it unless youve read the book, the mystery and intrigue are part of what made this story so amazing! The concept of mesarthium and the Mesarthim was AMAZING!!! I love that theres a race of gods who are blue. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I loved that they all had their own unique abilities! The citadel was incredible too, and the blue metal mesarthium. I cannot sing the praises enough for the premise! The back story of Weep is SO haunting and tragic. This book was heartbreaking, and its so beautifully written that you can see both sides of the story. You can understand WHY the Godslayer did what he did, as horrible as it was. You can understand the hatred, the desperation of the people that lived in Weep. But at the same time, it makes you feel SO MUCH for the Godspawn because they had nothing to do with their parents horrible reign. Yet the hatred is so deep seated because of the past. It was written in such a way that you could understand both perspectives. THAT ENDING. YOU GUYS. I cant. I just cant. I knew something bad was going to happen but I just didnt want to believe it. I desperately neeeed Muse of Nightmares! I cant wait to see where the story goes in the next installment! I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. I SHOULD HAVE. Knowing that Laini loves to write tragic and heartbreaking romances. Even though she tells you straight up in the beginning how this book is going to end, you cant help but hope for a happy ending. And for them to go through everything they went through and STILL not be together....I CANT. This review was originally posted on Novel Heartbeat.

This is another one of those books that sucked me in from the moment I picked it up. Had my weekend been a little less scheduled out this surely would have been a 1dayer..but life does happen and I didnt want it to pass me by, so I kept to my schedule and maybe lost a little bit of sleep to finish. What I Loved: I absolutely love the friendship between Emmy, Caro, Drew and Oliver in this book. Yes, Oliver is finding his way back into the friendship  but the camaraderie is still there. They are funny, sarcastic and just perfect together. Emmy and Oliver deals with some pretty tough issues, probably more than any one group of friends would normally have, but I really enjoyed how these four friends rely upon each other to get through, and yet they still have their problems; both personal and with each other. I really loved Emmy and Olivers relationship, how it started and grew. At first I was hurt probably as much as Emmy when it seemed like Oliver didnt really know her very well when Oliver came back, but it was nice to see them come together. The interludes of Emmy and Olivers childhood were fun as well! Honestly, reading this book felt a bit like watching a movie  I loved the writing style! Not So Much: There is a part of me that wishes that instead of this book being mostly about Emmy and Oliver, that it was opened up more to include the entire group. I really wanted more of Drew and Caros thoughts through the whole thing, and to see more behind the scenes of their homes and lives; they had just as many issues to deal with. Clearly, this would have changed the title of this book all together, but I really just loved the group as a whole so it was natural to just want to see more of all of them. While I did say that reading this book felt like watching a movie, I did feel like the action was a little eh, soso. I LOVED the friendships and growth and really found the book fun, but if this were a real movie, the story arc would be a little flat with a bit of a pitch at the climax. The Verdict: This book is appropriate for mature teenagers. The setting is the last year of high school, and they are dealing with appropriate issues. There is, however, quite a bit of cussing and some alcohol in this book. Overall though, I do recommend Emmy and Oliver. Its a great coming of age book!
Winter is the last book in the Lunar Chronicles series by Marissa Meyer which follows all the characters we have come to love through the series and Winter, based on Snow White. And it kicked ass. This book just made me insanely happy, I was just filled with this feeling of rightness as I was reading it. I love all of this characters, my little rampion squad, and I will protect them with my life. Im going to be honest, I finished this book like 10 minutes ago and then looked up and said to my flatmate Ive finished it. Now what do I do? so now probably isnt the best time to be writing a review. But here I am, doing it anyway because I want to have this out for release day tomorrow. Ill probably return and rewrite this later once Ive reread and I WILL be rereading! Cinder is such an amazing character, she just is. I mean all of Meyers characters are amazing and their relationships with each other are like my favourite thing ever, I just love strong friendships in books and this is like the strongest squad of friends ever. I want to be part of the rampion crew, I want to have jackets made and look all badass whilst saving the world not that they have jackets but hey, maybe someday? call me. We get to see all of the rampion crew during this novel lots of Scarlet again as well, yay and they all get their own say and input. Like with all the previous books Winter adds a new character to the mix, Winter, who is based of the fairytale character Snow White. Shes not all with it either, as a side effect of refusing to use her mind control lunar gifts she has regular hallucinations and visions. She is mostly left alone, but tension is growing between her and her stepmother Queen Levana. Even after Levana forced Winter to disfigure her own face with a knife Winters beauty is evident to all around her and Levana is growing jealous. Levanas throne is breaking, ever so slowly, she is being undermined. Princess Selene has come to take back her crown, her planet. She has a badass team behind her and also has almost nothing to lose. This book was a worthy end to a series which is up there with my favourites, up there with Harry Potter even. At 823 pages its a mammoth book but it tied all loose ends, things I hadnt even considered, and just was so good. Also Meyers ability to surprise me with plot points that follow the original fairytales we all know is so amazing. How can I not have seen it coming, how does she manage to surprise me with a story I have known my whole life? And yet she does. Meyer, I will remain a loyal reader for a long time yet. Look Im in a postWinter haze. But you need to read this series. You NEED to read Winter. Please. In conclusion DO IT.
Review also found at  4.5 stars I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher Knopf via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. THANK YOU! The expected publication date is January 6th 2014. I have to be honest that I was skeptical about this read before starting it. The blurb compares it to some heavy weight books by heavy weight authors in this genre who have had a lot of media attention in the last year. I felt that this could be a disservice to the book as it would raise expectations that may be hard to meet. Needless to say that there was no fear in that as I absolutely adored this book although I stand by my thoughts about the risk of comparing it to other blockbuster books. No matter what I write down on this page I will not be able to do this story justice. I will not capture the humour, the love, the emotions or the tears so I wont try. Instead you are stuck with my measly attempt to form some kind of thought. Here goes nothing.... Every so often a character comes along that you just fall in love with. While you cant completely pinpoint the reason why, you just know that this character will stick with you and you will remember them long after you have moved on to the next 500 books and characters. This was Finch for me. His seize the day attitude had me from the very beginning when he spoke his first words to Violet. Although he was dealing with some very dark issues his approach to life was completely refreshing. How he said what he wanted, acted the way he wanted and continually reinvented himself was so overwhelmingly charming that I found myself constantly smiling. His attributes that resulted in him being labeled as a freak are the same ones I repeatedly fell in love with. He has made my top five list of all time favorite book characters. Although not as charismatic as Finch, Violet held her own in the story. She was essentially a nice girl who was drowning in grief and needed to find her way again. The way she never looked at Finch with the same eyes that her friends did was endearing. Put these two together and I was lost. The concept of them wandering for a school project was as unique as the characters. With Finchs outlook of living for today their adventures were amusing and heart warming. Their exchanges on Facebook were relevant with todays times and the messages completely sweet. I will stop here. I think you get the picture as I seem to be gushing a little bit here. To me this is one of the best YA books that I have had the luxury to read. I laughed out loud in one moment and shed tears like a blubbering idiot in another. This was simply a beautiful story about two people dealing with dark issues who ultimately save each other. I say just go out and read it now. On a side note: My fifteen year old niece usually recommends to me what novel to read in this genre. This time I get to recommend one to her that I know she will love and will resonate with her demographic. I predict great things with this novel. I see it is already slated to become a movie...I am not surprised.
Second read: October 2017  5 stars WOW! I enjoyed this so much more the second time around. I think for two major reasons: 1 The first time I read this, there was like a year between reading Crown of Midnight and Heir of Fire. The second time I read this, I read Throne of Glass, Crown of Midnight, and Heir of Fire all back to back. I think not having a year long gap between CoM and HoF allowed me to enjoy HoF so much more. I was firmly in the zone of this series, if that makes sense. I wonder if I didnt enjoy it as much the first time because Id forgotten details and just wasnt totally in the right frame of mind. 2 I think knowing what to expect helped me enjoy certain parts of the book. The first time I read it, I hated Manons chapters. I just had zero interest in them. But the second time I knew they were there and tried to be more open minded about them. I gave them more of a chance and read them more carefully. I think I ended up really loving them as a result of that. First read: May 2014  2.5 stars This completely BREAKS MY HEART!! Above all, I thought Heir of Fire was boring. : The book was 569 pages long and for AT LEAST 400 of those pages I was bored out of my mind. Nothing was happening, just a lot of training, waiting, plotting, waiting, more training, etc. Then, to make it worse for memaybe not you there was ZERO romance. The romance was one of the things I loved most about Crown of Midnight. Those first 400450 pages were like a 2 star read for me. I started out kind of liking it, but I think thats mostly because I was waiting for it to get good and I so desperately wanted and EXPECTED to like it, so that made me kind of like it. But then that pretending fell apart and I realized just how bored I was. Then, towards the end, things finally did pick up a bit and it was more like a 3.5 star read maybe with glimpses of 4 stars here and there. Im so disappointed! : I feel like I read this book wrong because WHY DIDNT I LOVE IT?!?!
You can see this full review and more at Book Briefs:  3.55 Oh, holy hell! Black Iris is INTENSE! Leah Raeder certainly grabbed my attention with this book, that is for sure. I dont read books this dark and, well...messed up that often. Sometimes I will read a dark book. Or sometimes I will read a book with a totally fed up in the head main character, but I hardly ever read books that take it to the level that Leah Raeder did. Black Iris took me out of my comfort zone...and then some. And I have to say, I really, really liked it. Maybe that makes me a little dark and messed up too. I dont know. But what I do know, is that this book deserves every bit of attention it has gotten and more. Black Iris is first and foremost a revenge story driven by the main character, Laney. From the moment, that Laney broke the fourth wall and told us that she was not going to be likeable or a hero, I knew I was going to like her. And her idea for revenge molts and changes so many times throughout the story. It really becomes a journey of self discovery, however unintentional that may have been for her. This book will not be for everyone. Laney is crass, and out there and so totally unapologetic in everything she does. I loved that about her, but I can see that she not to mention the abundant drug use in Black Iris. might be off putting to some. But Laney is Laney. Black Iris is hard to explain. It almost took on a life of its own for me. It is dark, and crazy, and so different from what I normally read that I just kept lapping up every well placed word Leah Raeder wrote. And lets talk about her writing for a second. I really really dug her writing style. It was all at once conversational, and then also metaphorical, abstract, poetic and kind of grandiose. I know that makes no kind of sense, but I swear that is what it seemed like while I was reading Black Iris. I felt like I was sitting in the same room as Laney watching the events unfold, and then in the next scene I was removed and watching something important unfold far away. Black Iris has layers, man. So many layers. If you are brave enough to take a dip in a deep, dark pool of depravity with truly beautiful writing, you should be reading Black Iris. But be warned, this is not just another contemporary new adult romance. This review was originally posted on Book Briefs
I was intrigued by A Darker Shade of Magic, but it wasnt really on my radar for a book I had to pick up the second it came out. I recieved a brandspankingnew fresh copy in my Owlcrate and it peeked my interest even more. I havent read anything by Schwab before this, but figured if Owlcrate was choosing to feature this book in their first book, it must be something special. Likes: I am a huge advocate for worldbuilding. When a story is set in a newly created world, I want to be able to understand what the world looks like, how society operates and how the world really works. Schwab did an amazing job creating the Londons. There is a lot of detail given to the history of the worlds, along with creating multiple Londons and characters. Kell. He stuck with you from the beginning. The beginning of the story starts with Kells jacket and you are immediately intrigued. Kell wore a very peculiar coat. It had neither one side, which would be conventional, nor two, which would be unexpected, but several, which was, of course, impossible. The first thing he did whenever he stepped out of one London and into another was take off the coat and turn it inside out once or twice or even three times until he found the side he needed. Once I met Lila, I could not get enough of her. I wanted every chapter to feature Lila and when it was just Kell, I felt like I almost wanted to rush through to get to Lila. I am not sure why I loved her character so much, but she felt like a best friend that I could go on some crazy adventures with. The whole concept of magic or the lack of magic in the Londons was really unique. I felt like it was fresh, new fantasy and enjoyed that I couldnt predict the plot. Gripes: The only thing that really frustrated me, in the beginning of the book, was that there was no real plot. I was reading about this amazing world, traveling between the Londons, meeting new people and enjoying the characters, but I felt like I was reading a story with no purpose. It was about 100 pages in when we had a clear purpose and path. I needed that. I love the characters and the worldbuilding, but I feel like I am floundering when a story doesnt have a direction. Victoria wrote this post on Twitter. As much as I agree with her, I did realize that plot was important to me. It didnt really matter what the plot in the story exactly was, but I just needed a purpose For more reviews visit A Flurry of Ponderings
Life is made of so many moments that mean nothing. Then one day, a single moment comes along to define every second that comes after. OH. My. God. This. Book!!!! Absolutely gorgeous! Seriously I cant even, even. This book just blew my mind. Yes, it was that good! An Ember in the Ashes touches you soul, its so beautiful and profound and its something else entirely. I didnt expect to like it so much. From the plot, to the setting, the story line, the characters, everything is so absolutely well written, its like a magical net that captures you thread by thread and enriches your soul. Sabaa Tahir imagines a beautiful frightening world, where fear masters the world and big changes are coming. The characters are so very well penned, all of them have depth and they are strong, courageous, honorable, beautiful, damaged souls. Fear is only your enemy if you allow it to be. Id rather die than live with no mercy, no honor, no soul. The plot is marvelous, it combines a kingdom, a beautiful Middle Eastern desert setting, oriental mythology and a very complex world, with warriors, scholars and enslaved people. The book is like a good quality coffee or tea with a bouquet of delicious flavors. I am so, so waiting for the sequel because this one just destroyed me, I cant wait to see what happens next. There are so many questions that need to be answered. Oh and yeah I am shocked that Im not making any comments about the love triangle, which is more like a double love triangle: girl is falling for 2 boys and one of the boys is falling for 2 girls. Relationship status: very complicated! As I was saying I am shocked that this doesnt disturb me because I hate love triangles. I really hate them, but in this book I just accept em.

Wow. I really did not think this would be better than Shadow and Bone. I absolutely love that book and gave it 5 stars but I would give this 10 stars if I could. Just my opinion, but I think you need to read The Grisha Trilogy before starting this. I know I was told that it didnt matter but I think it sets up the world and even though the little nods to SB are very small and inconsequential, they are way more satisfying if you know that they are. The world that Leigh Bardugo weaves is one of the best high fantasy environments I have ever read. The mix of Russian folklore fantasy with crime lords, murderers, thieves, and teenage gangs is fascinating and like nothing I have ever read before. I think the characters in this novel are Bardugos best and what really made the story so compelling. Although I love Alina, Malyen, the Darkling, and Nikolai from the Shadow  Bone series, I can barely compare them to how amazing the crew is in this novel. I generally love multiple POVs anyways and this was no exception. You begin to love each and every one of them, Inej the silent but deadly girl and Kazs right hand. I cant even begin to start describing Kaz. He is everything you hope to read for a hero, even when he ruthless and cruel, you cant help but love him. I loved reading from Jespers POV and his budding relationship with Wylan was sweet and I was really happy Bardugo didnt develop the entire thing in the first novel. That seems like a couple that needs a nice slow build. And then there is Matthias and Nina, which was my absolute favourite POV to read. I loved the whole enemies to lovers aspect, and the way Nina brought Matthias out of his rigid and cold shell. The flashbacks were a great part of the entire novel, and I think it made Nina and Matthias story even better. We learn a lot about Kaz that makes him more...human? Not just a product of the hard streets. The whole idea of a big heist, completely oceans eleven style, mixed with the same world we were introduced to in Shadow  Bone, with a rough but endearing crew was beyond perfect. I think the alternating POVs worked so well to add to the mystery of the novel, as we get everyones perspective on the events that unfold. I cant wait to read the next book, Crooked Kingdom! I have that and Ruin and Rising waiting at the library and I am kind of excited that I have no idea which one is going to become available first, I am very excited to read both!

Technically speaking, Colleen Hoover is a great author. Her writing is on flick, all her characters although very similar in all her books are intriguing and interesting, her plots always revolving around abuse never tire me. Although she uses the same pattern for her writing over and over again, there is something about each and every book of hers that makes her a great author. Of course, everything that happens in her books are predictable but it didnt bother me in this one as much as it usually does. I liked the book the way it is for it is unlike anything CH has ever written. Its not an actionpacked novel, its more psychological than it is eventful and the pace matches the subject of the book so theres not much else to say about it technically speaking. Its not a perfect book but it is a pretty damn good book to me. Now, emotionally speaking, this book was a rollercoaster. This book is true and important. It is deep and realistic. It is hurtful and hard to digest because it is a reality we didnt know and couldnt understand before, displayed through the eyes of a young woman. I caught myself judging Lily quite a lot even though I had no right to do so and I really dislike that part of myself. I really dislike the fact that judging victims of abuse is even allowed and that I was ever a part of it. I hated when Lily was trying to find excuses for Ryles behaviour, I hated when she forgave him and allowed him to stay, I hated that Ryle did that to her, I hated that they did that to their daughter...but what I hated the most is that Ryle wasnt all evil, that they could have been so happy. He was a good person who did bad things, he was a damaged guy with a heavy past but nothing he went through can excuse what he did and I loved that Lily realized that. I loved that she stood up for herself and her child, I loved that everyone around Lily didnt try to defend what Ryle did. Every step of Lilys processing through this was handled honestly. From the deep love to hatred to forgiveness to love and hatred again to so many more emotions. This book may be partly fictional but the issue it deals with is not. Colleen Hoovers note at the end of the book is what made me give this novel a 5star rating because what she said is true: abuse is not just black and white, its thousands and thousands of shades blended together, its something deep, something that can truly be felt and understood only by the people who are directly affected by it. I have never been physically abused by someone I love, so I am in no position to say anything further than that. However, let me tell you this: I applause the courage of every single person who has ever suffered from abuse. I applause their strength and their bravery even in their moments of doubts and weakness. Be brave and bold. Finally, keep in mind that It Ends With Us is in no way a portrayalgeneralization of all abusive relationships, it is a book inspired by the story of a woman and a man, one abusive relationship amongst many, many more.
Reread March 2015 This is my favorite dystopian series so I decided to reread it this year. Im so glad I did! Champion is by far my favorite of the three novels. The first time around it had been a while since I read the previous two books. I was able to pick up on so much more this time around. This book is brilliant. Lu can write feelings and emotion like few authors Ive read before. I felt what June and Day were feeling as they faced their new roles in society and in each others lives. There was so much to overcome based on the things that happened in their pasts. The politics were actually a high point in this for me as well. I loved that while June and Days relationship was an important part of the story, it wasnt the only focus. There was so much more going on and they each had very distinct roles to fill. And the ending! This is one of the most beautifully done endings that I hsve ever read. There was so much emotion and it just tore my heart to feel what they felt. It was powerful the first time, but even more so this time. There is honestly nothing I would change about this book. Its simply beautiful. Everyone should read it. Original Review: Jan 2014 I thought this was a fantastic conclusion to a great series! The story was well developed and I never felt like there was a huge lull in action, which Ive seen a lot of in conclusions lately. I have not read Legend or Prodigy in quite a while, but based on my memories I think I may like this the best of the three. The love between Day and June was more realistic and mature in this novel and I found myself constantly captivated by their struggles to come to terms with all that had gone wrong in their past. I also thought the other relationships were very well developed and lifelike. Day and Eden were sweet and seemed everything that two brothers with no one else should be. Tess was also a nice touch the little bit she was in here, having grown up a lot since the last book. The action and fighting were also exciting and meaningful. Ive seen so much lately where nothing seems to happen and the conflict just kind of disappears. This kept you going and kept the conflict present the entire time. And the conclusion to the war was hopeful without being overly done. Overall I think this was a phenomenal book. The ending was bittersweet, but I would lean more toward sweet than bitter personally. I think that both Day and June grew a lot in this book and that Marie Lu did an excellent job of showing that sometimes if you love someone you have to let them go, because sometimes what they need might not be something you can offer. And if your love is meant to be, you will find your way back to each other. Sweet, sad, action packed, and just a pure joy to read. Thank you, Marie Lu, for not disappointing me. It has been a pleasure to be immersed in your world.
JUST ONE DAY was not what I expected. I highly respect Gayle Forman, so I was expecting to love the novel. But I expected a romance. Allyson and Willem meet and have a whirlwind day before he disappears. In my head, based on the summary, I figured JUST ONE DAY would be all about finding Willem again and the true lovers reuniting. As Forman is an excellent author, what she delivered was much better than what Id assumed. JUST ONE DAY really is Allysons story. Willem shook her world up, for better or worse, and she has to decide how she wants to live her life and repair her relationship with herself before any sort of romance is going to work. Upon physically looking at my bookmarks in the book, Willem and Allysons relationship is not insignificant. At least two thirds of the book are basically what I expected. But that third that was so unexpected lingered in my mind. Allysons freshman year of college is not easy. Shes hurting, shes separated from her best friend and not doing well at making new ones, and her grades arent what they were in high school. As everyone must, however, Allyson learns to adjust and reassess her goals. Part of the shock of college is being truly responsible for your life choices. Allysons college experience doesnt resemble mine in any way, but it was emotionally authentic. Sometimes it was hard to read because her struggle hit so close to the bone. If theres one thing Forman does really well its play your emotions. I have to give props to the entire cast. Im sure many reviews will go on and on about how hot Willem is. Ill admit that hes intelligent and fun, but he has some douchebag qualities. Part of Allysons growth is not idealizing Willem and figuring out if she wants to be with the guy who actually exists. But I want to say a few things about characters who might go unheralded. I love Kali, who emphasizes her words, and all of Allysons other roommates, who might not be the people Allyson first assumes. Who is? Dee the chameleon is priceless and I want a book all about him. I like that Melanie falls in and out of the narrative because she has her own life and is adjusting, albeit in a different way than Allyson. You should read JUST ONE DAY if you have any interest in contemporary YA, amateur Shakespeare, Paris, or impeccable characterization. Forman is one of YAs crown jewels and I think her new duet will only add to her reputation. Im certainly looking forward to companion novel JUST ONE YEAR.
Its time to prepare ourselves! Illuminae is bound to take every one of us on a crazy, fun ride set in a thrilling, scifi world! Let me start off by telling you whatever you think you know about Illuminae, based on the books summary, you dont even know half of what this book contains. The whole concept of this story is awesome! I have never read anything in the type of format that Illuminae is told in, and it was so cool to read such a unique story like this. As I was reading, I started to lose count of how many twists and mindblowing moments there were. Just when you think you understand a certain plot point in the story, the authors switch everything around, and you are thrown in a completely new direction. I havent had as much fun reading as I did while reading Illuminae in a long time! The characters were strong, even the supporting characters. All of the things that lead us from the beginning to the ending are crazy and intense. I cant tell you how many emotions I had while reading this book. There is a scene in the book between Kady, our heroine, and AIDAN, the artificial intelligence, that is so heartbreaking and beautiful  it truly represents the whole meaning behind Illuminae. Kaufman and Kristoff really showed me that there is good in all of us, even if evil can take over, and if we are shown that goodness in others then it should remind us of our own. How amazing is it to find some truth of yourself in a story you are reading about other characters? Each character shows that no matter how much is lost, there is always hope and reasons to keep going, and I found that important throughout the whole story. I cant give enough praise to Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff for writing this fantastic book. I appreciate all the hard work put into telling this amazing story, and in the way that they did. It was such a fun and thrilling ride. You know those books where even when you arent reading them, you are constantly thinking about them? Illuminae is one of those books. It has all the ingredients of a great scifi, young adult trilogy, with NO love triangle! I cant wait for the next book! FULL REVIEW HERE
does not disappoint!!!!!!!!!! I feel like I have been waiting for Duke of Sin  Maiden Lane 10  since I started reading this series with Duke of Midnight. I was instantly hooked on the series and Ive been trying to read the previous books but they are not necessary to appreciate the stories, they are easily stand alone. First, I was so eager for Vals story I was worried I would be disappointed! But I can say there was not one word or line that disappointed me in Duke of Sin. I devoured it! Once I started reading it I was hooked on the story, the characters and how Hoyt would unfold the story. Lets start with Val. He is so complex, multilayered, feral and unapologetic that I was fascinated by him. One of my pet peeves is when a hero is presented as a heroantihero rogue and then, well, really isnt. Val is definitely a villain who doesnt find it necessary to dress in heros clothing. He is absolutely awful and intriguing. He stops at nothing to win, and is a winner takes all type of hero. I found him so fascinating in the previous books and in his story he lives up to his reputation. Next, the heroine Bridget Crumb. She is a servant in Vals house. Even though this is her work she has a very specific purpose for being here. Bridget is probably the antithesis of Val. Where he grew up rich she had very humble beginnings. Where Val is egotistical, Bridget often has to be reminded to stand up for her own interests. Now, this is the part I love best! Bridget is fierce. She is not afraid of Val and doesnt back down from him. Val is instantly intrigued with Bridget. He, who is a very good study of peoples nature, knows that there are many layers to Bridget and he is not afraid to find out what those layers are. Val and Bridget are a fantastic couple they go down as one of my favorite. The pacing of the story is fantastic. Val who has been exiled in previous books is ready to come out of hiding. He is not afraid of society nor those who want to harm him, and because Val is a blackmailer and manipulatorhe has a list of enemies. Val is anything but boring and he was so much fun to read about. Even though there are many light and witty barbs shared with him and Bridget, Val is a very deep and spirited person and there are some very dark moments in the story. However, once he cares for someone there is very little he will not do for them. Finally, Hoyt has once again hooked me and now I am anticipating the next book Duke of Pleasure where the infamous Ghost is a woman! Plus, Alf! What does she have in store for her? Loved, loved, loved Duke of Sin. Found it incredibly climatic and highly enjoyable. Now the count down to Duke of Pleasure begins!
PHEW.. I feel rung out right now. I just sat down and read this book cover to cover in just a few hours. My sisterinlaw lent me the book after raving about Colleen Hoover and all of her books. I can tell you that this book was not what I expected at all. I thought I was going to read a flowery book about a love triangle. Despite the back of the book, this is not what it is. Spoilers to follow.  This is a novel about domestic violence. This topic always pierces my heart because I got the horror of watching it happen to my mother with one of her boyfriends when I was younger. I very much appreciate the realistic way that Lily is shown falling into the trap of excusing abusive behavior from her perfect significant other. Atlas is important to the story line because he is the catalyst in a lot of their altercations. Ryle is aggressively jealous of Atlas and the idea that she could be cheating on him or hiding something from him. The most we actually see from Atlas is flashbacks in the form of letters to Ellen where you get to see a 15 year old fall in love with a homeless boy who has tried everything to get help and is just trying to graduate high school. He does pop up at significant moments ie., the first time Ryle meets Lilys mom. However, most of this happens from the perceived threat that Ryle feels. Atlas gives Lily his number in case she ever needs out very early on, and Ryle finds it months later which causes one of their altercations. All of these characters are brilliantly developed and I would be hardpressed to say who my favorite is. It could be Lilys mom for being brave enough to tell Lily to get out and not to repeat her mistakes, it could be Atlas who does pull himself up by his Marine bootstraps and make something of himself while waiting to save a woman he knew was in an abusive relationship. It could be Alyssa for her unending support of Lily despite Ryle being her brother. Finally, there is Lily. Lily who grew up in a house that was filled with domestic abuse and promised to never be her mother. Lily who found herself in the same position and then found the strength to leave when it wasnt easy. Lily who learned some hard adult truths about her parents and could respect and love them despite their flaws. Lily, who broke the cycle.
On Cupid Day, Sam Kingstons day is pretty typical. She hangs out with her popular clique of friends, skips class to get frozen yogurt, and goes to a party.... but then she dies in a horrific accident and suddenly nothing about this day is normal anymore. Now Sam is forced to live Cupid Day over and over again until she figures out... well there has to be a reason this is happening, right??? My Thoughts: Lauren Oliver  new favorite author!! I cant believe I waited so long to read such a ME book. What was I thinking?? As soon as I read the first page I was hooked. Its everything I love in YA. The high school social dynamics, the finding out who you are stuff, the beginning of it all. It was like a high school version of Bill Murrays Groundhog Day Fun Fact: I live really close to Punxsutawney, PA, and I loved it. This is one of those books that I couldnt stop thinking about... and still kinda cant. I kept wondering how Sam was going to get herself out of this loop that she was in and I was worried about her. I know she doesnt exist IRL, but she felt insanely real to me! Okay, and I was also mildly concerned about whether or not she was going to realize Kents awesomeness. What I loved: I LOVED that Lauren Oliver created a realistic world where peoples behaviors have consequences, but they arent overexaggerated consequences. I dont know how to explain it, but basically lessons are learned without it being overly and annoyingly lessony. If that makes sense. I liked how Sam realized that being a mean girl wasnt something to be proud of, but at the same time, she still loved her friends. She didnt turn away from their flaws okay, well there was that ONE day, she wanted to understand why they were the way they were, and she still wanted it to be okay for her to love them. And she did love them even though they werent going through the same realizations as she was. I also have to say KENT!! I really really loved Kent. This whole book could have been about him and I wouldve been happy. What I didnt love: There are 7 days of Sam trying to figure stuff out. I would be lying if I didnt say that there was a point where it was dragging a bit I mean it is 490 pages!!!. Especially because one day was epicly perfect and I wanted it to just end right there. But once I pushed through that part, I got right back on track. The other thing I didnt love was: The Ending. Why Lauren Oliver, why? I cried because I was sad and also because I SO wanted everything to turn out differently. OVERALL: Read this book!!! Its the perfect YA book. Perfect! It has mean girls, and popularity, the cute geeky crushworthy guy, family, and just LIFE. I cant recommend this enough. My Blog:
This review and more can be found on Living for the Books I dont think there has ever been a series quite like this one. It always seemed so unique and I guess thats why I love it so much. This was exactly what I needed to get out of my reading slump. I think that part of the reason why this book just works so well is because the characters are so very real and unforgettable. Its been over a year since the last book and I havent forgotten a single thing about the characters, maybe a few minor details here and there, but honestly it didnt feel like I should have reread any of the other books before starting this one. The characters are like real people and while reading you can feel that. And the friendship that the characters share doesnt feel forced or fake, its like real friends. Youd think that a series that basically starts off warning that Blue would kill her true love would be all about that and feature a lot of romance, but shockingly it doesnt. This book probably has the most romance out of the four, but it doesnt take over the plot. Instead it feels natural and like it belongs. I love Blue and Ganseys relationship because it evolves from friendship and they just seem so perfect together. Ive been shipping Adam and Ronan since the last book because they also just seem to be perfect for each other. Overall, Im very satisfied with how this book and how the story ended. It had the perfect amount of intrigue to keep me reading and it ended in a way that seems very fitting for this series. There is a fairly large cast of characters, but it wasnt hard to keep track of them all and somehow none of them were flat. They were all interesting and when it switched point of view to one of the more minor characters I wasnt hoping that it would go back to the main crew because the side characters were just as interesting. It has been a long time since I have felt this satisfied with an entire series and I could go on and on about how much I love these characters and how much Im going to miss them. I would say more but I dont want to spoil anything by accident, so all I have left to say is that everyone should give this series a shot.
Thrilling, scary, and creepy real. This will have you saying What the hell just happened. This book was....AMAZING! I could not put it down and I found myself not wanting to read it at night because I kept thinking how real this could be, because we never know what strangers are thinking! It really opens up your mind and has you second guessing that stranger who looked at you the other day a little too long. If you dont start with crazy, crazy love, the kind of love that Van Morrison sings about, then you dont have a shot to go the distance. Joe Goldberg works in a book store, thats where he sees Guinevere Beck for the first time. Joe knows immediately he needs to know everything there is about her so he googles her name he found on her credit card. Her friends call her Beck, she is a social media Goddess, tweeting, facebooking and emailing constantly. Joe is intrigued with her mind, her writing and her pure sex appeal she has no problem showing off. He puts himself in her life immediatly just watching her, being where she is, slowly pulling on the string and bringing her into his arms. Joe will stop at nothing to have ALL of Beck. This book is told in Joes point of view, so you are in the mind of a stalker. He is mostly talking to Beck in his head the whole entire book. Its crazy how on the outside he is more shy and reserved but on the inside his mind goes wild and insane. He literally is OBSESSED beyond belief with this woman. He hacks into her life and gets to know her through her secrets and her personal belongings. It was so scary how patient Joe was, how calm he was throughout this whole book even when he was committing the worst crimes there are. Work in a bookstore and learn that most people in this world feel guilty about being who they are. As crazy as it made me feel, I actually really liked Joe! He was a great main character, he was charming and a gentleman and he is probably the smartest character out there! I was so jealous at his knowledge of books and the storys that they came from. I loved how he came up with stories of people just by what books they were reading and I wondered what he would have judged me like. This book has you thinking all sorts of things and everytime I am in Barnes  Nobles now I am going to be wondering if there is a cage somewhere in the basement. The problem with books is that they end. You have to read this! I recommend this to everyone, its very interesting and the writing is some of the most amazing that I have read yet. Its told in second person and the author does a great job. Its very creepy but its a very good story and there is also a second book and Im so excited that the story of Joe Goldberg isnt over! I cant wait to dig into Hidden Bodies.
reviews.metaphorosis.com 4.5 stars When a major storm hits their base, a Mars landing mission is abandoned early. Badly injured, Mark Watney is left for dead. When he comes to, hes the only man on an entire planet, and must figure out how to survive on his own. This reads more like a thought experiment than a normal novel. If I were in this situation, what would I do? The afterword reveals this to be essentially the truth. The thing is, its a very interesting thought experiment. While technically science fiction, this is really more in the category of technology fiction  not exploration of basic principles or ideas as figuring out how to apply current techniques an extreme situation. Sounds dry, doesnt it? Yet, despite constant descriptions of how to calculate this and that, the book is engaging and intriguing. Maybe its because as an Iusedtobeascientist, I liked the calculatory bits. They add verisimilitude. Some of them are a bit questionable, and I didnt take the time to check them, but overall, they seem like credible seat of the pants calculations  exactly the kind a stranded astronaut might concoct. In most cases, I read them, and thought that sounds reasonable. And Weir is thorough; there isnt much that he tries to get away with by handwaving. There is one consistency error, but its not a big deal. Thoroughness and credibility carry a lot of the weight in this novel. But what really makes the book work is Weirs terrific sense of humor. Its that that makes you like his character Watney, and that makes you want to carry on. Its essential in a book thats largely monologue, and Weir pulls it off beautifully. I read this at the same time as a more literary collection by another author. Both books are the same length, but I managed only a few dozen pages in the anthology in the same time I read Weirs entire book. Wry adventure was always more enticing. Thats not to say the writing is perfect. Weir makes some cheap and slightly offensive jokes that should have been edited out. He leans a bit on stereotype for the other characters the German in particular. And he cant get past the sheer crappiness of 70s entertainment. Generally though, the book is a lot of fun to read  in the way that Stephen Baxter equally tech and projectionoriented often isnt. In his afterword, Weir inadvertently suggests a Heinlein comparison, and I think theres something to that. I picked this book up based on reviews, and Im glad I did. Its one of the few books that matches its hype. Its a fun read, and one that builds respect for science as craft not magic genius sorcery. Recommended for everyone, and particularly for young folk just getting interested in science. Its the kind of book I read when I was young, that made me think science was cool, and something I personally could do.
Such an amazing ending for a wonderful series. As you know, Across the Universe is one of my favorite series, so I felt pretty sad to see it end. More when the cover has changed and it doesnt fit the other 2 books sigh But this doesnt mean that I enjoyed it less for that. It was still full of action, suspense and pure awesomeness. We finally get to the planet weve been traveling towards to for so long. We are finally there. Amy has her family back. People are starting to show respect and faith in Elder. But do things get easier as they land? They dont. BIG PLUS Our mind is full of questions: Will people get along with each other, will the planet want them to be there, will our people survive the hostility that is to come? Will Amy and Elder have their happy ending? And what about the people that remained on the ship, and what about all those secrets? But dont worry; you get answers for each of them and then some more. I tell you, this book is great  the characters are very well defined at this point, the plot is unpredictable, full of danger, mystery, deaths, revelations and it does tie up all loose ends. TINY MINUS One things though... There was one thing about the habitants of this planet that bothered me. Just how easily a particular someone could mix with the people from Earth  maybe I need to read the book again because I simply cant see how no one questioned his presence, his identity. And the way those habitants acted was so brutal, I am not against it, but I wish there was a chance for a different start. CONCLUSION One of the best endings to a series! There were ups there were downs, but I felt like they fully belonged in this story. Sometimes I didnt agree with something happening, but I know that it had to happen. The pacing was a bit slow in the beginning, but it picked up pretty fast and I barely could keep up with it in the second half of the book. All in one, a great book to end a wonderful series that I loved with all my heart. Hope that you enjoyed it as well. Happy midnight reading!

Thank you, NetGalley, for providing this book from St. Martins Griffin for review! Maya was cursed since the day she was born. Because her mother died and she lived, the other harem wives of her father, the Raja, believe in Mayas horoscope: her marriage is one of death and destruction. When the Raja asks Maya to give her life for her kingdom on the brink of war, Maya painfully agrees to do so  and instead finds herself in Akaran with Amar, a raja who promises equality and power. But strange things are happening in Akaran, and as Maya tiptoes the edge of secrets, shes thrust into unraveling an ancient mystery, one that could alter thousands of lives and truly bring about devastation. I wanted a love thick with time, as inscrutable as if a lathe had carved it from night and as familiar as the marrow in my bones. I wanted the impossible, which made it that much easier to push out of my mind. What a ride. There are no comparable titles, only authors, that I can give. Chokshis writing is vivid as Erin Morgensterns and as otherworldly as Laini Taylors. Toss in the beauty of Indian myth and folklore, and youre destined for an adventurous read. I havent read a YA fantasy quite is unique and steeped in nonEuro culture as this either ever or in a long while!. Chokshi is like a breath of fresh air! Mayas journey is unique, yet familiar. Though there are words and beliefs and myths completely unfamiliar to me, its Mayas quest for answers and character growth thats recognizable. The last third of the book heavily relies on Indian mythology, I felt, with a fantastical, otherworldly quest Maya must fulfill in order to restore the balance between the mortal world and Akaran. Hang on tight. It may seem a little confusing, but its entirely worth it in the end. You are, along with Maya, experiencing several reincarnated lives, and every word in this book matters! I know your soul. Everything else is an ornament. Amar is also a great character for a love interest. Its easy to see why Mayas drawn to him, and its understandable when her trust begins to falter. How can someone so ethereal, composed, and determined to show compassion and equality also refuse to tell her anything deep about himself, about his world, his past? What is he hiding? And why cant he share it with her? All this complications made for an intense relationship, and a key to Mayas quest, and I deeply enjoyed the character exploration. Chokshi is officially on my watch list. Ill happily read anything else she publishes! quotes taken from uncorrected proof
I dare you to read this book and not be changed by it.  Above was my review after the third time I read this book. Id guess that was in 2006. The first time I read this book I was 17 and I was deeply moved by the storys comments on race and innocence. I read the book again when I was 21. I was struck most in that reading by how Harper Lee infused humor into the tale. My reading in 2006 had me ruminating on its theme of poverty. This last reading had me seeing things through Atticus and Heck Tates and Miss Maudies eyes. I especially reframed my ideas about Alexandra, Atticuss uptight sister. I hated her in all three of my previous readings, but I saw her motivations more clearly this time. Her love for her brother, her efforts to give his household more structure, her need to pick up and move on. The book group was unsurprisingly raving about the book. It is so tightly written; we spent quite a bit of time discussing the effects of a good editor on a story and how that symbiosis between author and editor is all but lost in the current age of selfpublishing. Many of us talked about how we had had to read this book in high school and didnt really get it then. A few of us resented it for being crammed down our throats as a student. But all that attended got over that within the first few chapters. That scene where Scout stands on the porch of the jailhouse and address Mr. Cunningham has got to be one of the most important scenes in literature. I know exactly where that scene is in the book because the pages are wrinkly from...water. We talked a bit about the counterpoint that this is another example of white people coming to the rescue of a black person. I can see that angle, but I think Harper Lee was smart in her telling of the novel. She had important things to say at a time when Civil Rights were just coming to a head. Atticus Finch was the perfect loudspeaker to get at the people who needed to hear the message the most. She treated the African Americans in the novel with respect. She gave them backstories and community with the chapters at Tom Robinsons house and at Calpurnias church. Those last two sentences should be a given, but at the time there were very few novels in white peoples hands that would pass the race version of the Bechdel test. To Kill a Mockingbird is still my favorite book. Period. A lot of readers have a hard time answering that question; I am not one of them. We couldnt get away without discussing Go Set A Watchman, Harper Lees recently released sequel to TKAM. I am not interested. I dont want anything to mar what I consider to be a perfect novel.
Best book of 2015 so far. Definitely. Things I loved about this book: 1. Mainly, the characters. This is a character driven story from start to finish and there isnt really too big of a detailed and complex plot not that there is no plot and not that it isnt good. Our main characters are Shahrzad and Khalid. Khalid is the King or Caliph of this world and inexplicably takes a new bride every day only to have killed her by dawn. Shahrzads best friend was one of these brides who was killed by the King, so she decides shes going to volunteer to be one of his wives, but she isnt planning on dying. She plans on killing the King. Both Shahrzad and Khalid are so multifaceted and complex, they felt like real people to me because they were flawed and because they made mistakes. I obviously dont want to give away too much but Ill just say this book has brilliant characterization, especially the two leads. 2. The side characters are also interesting, theres no weak link in this story except maybe Shahrzads father who I didnt find particularly interesting but thats a very minor gripe and very minor part of the book and they are all given their own motivations and personalities. Tariq, Despina, Jalal and everyone else whose names I cant spell to save my life. They were all great. I wanted to know more about Despina and Jalal especially and I cant wait to see how everything unfolds for them in the sequel. Tariq was definitely interesting and as time went on I found myself liking him less and less, but I still found his internal struggles and dilemmas to be fascinating. 3. The romance and the development of said romance. Im sure Im not making any shocking statements when I say Khalid and Shazi maybe start having some feelings for each other. I love how this was handled; I loved the slow burn of it. I loved seeing Khalid come out of his shell. I loved seeing Shazis walls come down. It made me like so giddy every time they had a scene together. All of them left me either smiling like an idiot or wanting to shake some sense into them both for being so stubborn. So really I could rave about this book forever. Ive felt kind of in a reading slump lately but this reminded me how amazing books can be and how they can reignite your love of reading. I hope to continue on a good streak but this one is going to be hard to beat!
1. The surface story Set in 1962, fourteen years after the end of a longer WW2 19391948. The victorious Axis Powers Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and Italy carved up the world at the end of the war. The Nazis have turned the Mediterranean into a huge agricultural area, killed the entire population of Africa, and most of the Soviet Union, and are sending spaceships to colonise Mars. The Nazis and Japan, the superpowers, are in a Cold War situation. The Man in the High Castle takes place on the West Coast of the USA. In the book the USA is split into The Pacific States of America  a region run by Japan, and the rest of the US run indirectly by the Nazis. The story follows a collection of characters based in San Francisco who are linked either directly or indirectly and who are getting on with their lives. I really enjoyed the story, and thought Dicks imagined postWar world was interesting and credible. The narrative is occasionally a bit confusing but always stimulating, particularly the detail of daily life. For example the way Japanese culture and customs have come to inform daily life for indigenous Americans. There is also another story within the story. A bestselling book called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy  a populist Science Fiction novel in which America and the Allies win the Second World War. This book has become successful and so the Nazis want the author killed. This secondary story hints at some of the themes below the surface of the main narrative. 2. Themes The Man in the High Castle made me think about history, and how it is written by the victors. For example, in the alternate world of this book, Churchill is cast as a war criminal. The book also asks other questions about history. Some of the characters collect, sell and create or forge historical memorabilia. Is history innate in memorabilia or just in the mind? As one of the books characters explains, if we believe that a lighter was in Franklin D. Roosevelts pocket when he was assassinated it becomes more valuable to a collector despite being just another lighter. Another character claims to be an Italian who fought in North Africa. His account doesnt convince his female companion  rightly so as it turns out. The suggestion is that all history is relative and we cant rely on any single account. The parallel world of The Man in the High Castle also explores the possibility that there is no single reality. That there exists a multiverse rather than a universe that is at odds with the generally accepted view of just one linear history. None of the characters in the book, like ourselves, are able to perceive it. Although, at one point Nobusuke Tagomi, a Japanese official in Japaneserun San Francisco, finds himself momentarily in another San Francisco in which Japan was defeated by the Allies. Verdict My favourite Science Fiction writers e.g Phillip K Dick and Kurt Vonnegut reimagine our world and consider alternate futures and histories, that offer the reader new perspectives. This book is a great example of how effective this is when done well. Its a really interesting book that succeeds on both levels: the surface plot that kept me interested throughout, and the more provocative and profound questions posed by Philip K Dick.
Im thinking somewhere between 44.5! This book was tHE CUTEST. But also so real and emotional. And Simon and Blue... sigh. I adored them. I praise this book for its portrayal of high school both the wonderful and terrible parts of it, of parents, and of friendshipsrelationships. I really think that the Albertalli nailed this. It reminded me so much of my own group of friends in high school. It was very, very realistic. And its definitely worth mentioning that the diversity is on point with representations of different races, sexual orientations, and interracial relationships. I think nearly my favorite aspect okay yes my absolute favorite aspect is the romance oF COURSE was just having such a delightful and funny protagonist. Simon is unlike anyone Ive read about and it was really refreshing. I LOOOOVE when authors give them actual preferences, hobbies, and just all the little things that we sometimes dont get. It makes him that much more real. You truly feel like you know them. And he just had a good heart and I loved it. And I really adored his family and the portrayal and dynamics there. Again, it just felt real. One of the times I cried involved Simon talking to his parents and it was beautiful. Its so great to see healthy relationships between children and their parents, even when they fightdisagree. I was hooked from the very first chapter and couldnt wait to see and find out who Simons email penpal was. Its such a fast read for this reason. And let me tell youits worth it. I was getting so worried I was going to end up disappointed but it was handled SO INCREDIBLY WELL. I dont know why I even had doubts. It was perfect. It was sweet. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And once youve finished, going back through and reading certain interactions will make you smile so. hard. The way I feel about him is like a heartbeat  soft and persistent, underlying everything. I think my true complaint is that I wish there was more to read. More Simon and Blue. Just more! I NEED IT. But I also, at the same time, think that it ended very well and made me shed some tears. I highly recommend this. Im so incredibly happy that it was written because the world needs stories like this. Oh and shoutout to Albertalli for making the setting Atlanta because I live here and it made me happy to know all of the locations they talked about! Eeee!
WOW. CINDER. I sat down to read it Saturday morning and finished it by ten that night. It was a passionate, whirlwind affair, we fell violently in love, and Im just not ready to leave Cinder and the rest of New Beijing behind. If you cant tell, I absolutely loved this book. I love any kind of fairy tale update, and this is by far the most original one Ive ever read. Cinder takes place in a future where cyborgs are secondclass citizens, androids make up most of the servant class, and a terrible plague is devastating the Eastern Commonwealth. Not to mention the looming threat of the horrendously creepy Lunars, the inhabitants of the moon, and their evil Queen Levana. By far the best thing about Cinder is the world Meyer has created. This future feels very real and so fun. The idea of turning Cinderella into a cyborg with a metal foot and a retina display including an awesome thing where a little light goes off when people are lying was brilliant. Cinder herself is great and sympathetic lead character. Shes a talented mechanic since she is, in fact, about 36 machine. Thats how she meets the ohsoattractive Prince Kai, heir to the throne, who needs to get one of his androids fixed. Naturally, hes throwing a ball. Kai is sweet, smart, and totally overwhelmed by all the responsibility of being Emperortobe. It makes sense hed be drawn to a pretty and mysterious mechanic, especially if he doesnt know shes cyborg. Kai and Cinders developing relationship is cute and natural. Perhaps theres a hint of instalove, but this is a fairy tale, after all. Even if it is a sick, twisted one with hover crafts and evil murderous queens who live on the moon and can make you see things that arent there using only her BRAIN. All the fairy tale ingredients are present: a wicked stepmother, two stepsisters one of whom is not so wicked, a pumpkin which is actually an old orange car, and a ball. Yet its the parts where Meyer deviates from the formula that are the most fun. The subplots of the letumosis plague, the social aspects of having cyborgs in society, and of course the Lunars were what made this book. Iko the android is actually the most vivid character of the bunch, which, considering shes a machine, is fascinating. The plot is filled with fun twists, even though the big reveal at the end I saw coming a MILE away. I read this in a day, not wanting to part from Cinder and Kai and the delightful Iko for even a second. A lot of Cinders life is totally heartbreaking, but shes always plucky and never feels sorry for herself. This book contains a lot of setup, as its the first in a series of four, but I didnt think this was a problem at all. I love where the books are headed. You meet a character near the end who youll instantly recognize as another denizen of fairy tale land, and I positively squealed with glee. I guess my only true critique was how obvious that final twist was, though that didnt lessen my enjoyment of the reveal. Basically I would sell my right foot for Scarlet, book two in the Lunar Chronicles, and yes, that is a hint to anyone one out there lucky enough to currently possess an ARC.

Based on an old Russian fairy tale, The Snow Child by Eowyn Ivey is a beautiful story about Mabel and Jack, a childless elderly couple living on a farm in Alaska, and the young, mysterious snow child they come to love and adopt as their own. The story unfolds slowly and quietly with a decidedly nostalgic, almost melancholy tone permeating the novel. The Alaskan wilderness in all its seasons is described in such vivid detail and luscious imagery that it forms an essential backdrop to the story. One can almost feel the bitterly cold winds lashing against the body; see the vistas of unrelenting snow; hear the sound of feet squelching into the mudsoaked earth of spring; smell the crisp, clean winter air; and relish in the bountiful harvests of summer. Our senses are treated to the touch, sound, sight, and scent of pine forests, mountain herbs, and wild animals. Mabel and Jack brave the difficulties of eking a living in Alaskas unforgiving climate. They live and work in virtual isolation until they befriend their neighbors George, Esther, and their boys. Their life takes an unexpected turn when a snowman they craft disappears and a young girl mysteriously and intermittently flickers in the woods wearing the same scarf and mittens Mabel and Jack had used to dress their snowman. Eventually this snow child, Faina, turns up on their doorstep and befriends them. They adopt her as the child they always wanted even though they suspect there is something strange about her mysterious appearances and disappearances into the Alaskan wilderness. They learn to accept the girl, allowing her to enter and exit their lives on her own terms. The tender love Mabel and Jack have for each other is in evidence throughout the novel, especially during challenging times. We witness their growing love for Faina as they anxiously await her return each time she ventures out into the snowy wilderness. Ivey successfully portrays the characters as welldeveloped individuals who support each other and who gain our sympathy and admiration for their work ethic and determination to persevere. Esther is particularly colorful and manifests the undaunted spirit of pioneering women. The only character that remains elusive is Faina. Although she is more fully developed in the second half of the novel, she remains an enigma from start to finish. She seldom speaks and only rarely are we allowed access to her thoughts, all of which contribute to her mystique. The Snow Child immerses us in a magical place with a magical young girl as its focal point. But it is also a celebration of what is important in life: family; community; friendship; selfless love; the freedom to live as one chooses; adjusting to the rhythms of nature; and, above all, a willingness to accept the inexplicable as part of the mystery of life.
This was not what I expected at all. It was good, I loved the story and the writing but it was not great, of all Sarah J.Maas books this one is my least favorite. I think it focused on the romance and the love scenes at the expense of such a good story. Plot After Feyre the 19yearold huntress has killed a wolf, a beast appears at her home demanding retribution, because what she had killed was not a wolf, it was a faerie. When he gives her the choice between a lifetime in his land or death, she chooses to go with him. As she lives with him, her feelings move from hatred to passion and the secrets of the faerie lands starts to reveal themselves for her, and there is something wrong. Something she wants to help with but she cant, can she? Characters I loved Feyre but not all the time, I loved her before she goes with Tamlin, I wanted to see more of that character, the one that does everything for her family and learns things by trying them herself. After she moved, the story turned into a romance and I feel I didnt get enough of Feyre the huntress. The other thing I like her is that she cant read, I just cant handle it when a character is illiterate, I have to love her. I didnt like Tamlin and Lucien, yes they are nice but against Amarantha they didnt do much unlike Rhysand which I both love and hate. Opinion I think this was a great plot; I loved the idea of the courts, I even loved more that there is seven of them, not just the basic 4 seasons. This is the first book of a series but it couldve been a series itself, I think I would of loved it more if it were because the pace of the story moved fast sometimes. The other thing is through the book Amarantha was this unstoppable villain and even the high lords cant stop her but she wasnt at the end, I didnt like that. I think this book needed a better villain. It was a nice book, it had its flaws but I have to say the way it ended was so expected, it makes me think the other books of the series wont.
